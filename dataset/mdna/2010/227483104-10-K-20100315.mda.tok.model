item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  risk factors  forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other data  all of which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are a diversified leader in healthcare staffing services offering a comprehensive suite of staffing and outsourcing services to the healthcare market 
we report our financial results according to four business segments nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  clinical trials services and other human capital management services 
we believe we are one of the top two providers of travel nurse and allied staffing services in the united states  one of the top three providers of temporary physician staffing locum tenens services  a leading provider of clinical trials staffing services and retained physician search services  and a provider of educational seminars  specifically for the healthcare marketplace 
we have a diversified revenue mix across business sectors and healthcare customers 
for the year ended december   our nurse and allied staffing business segment represented approximately of our revenue and is comprised of travel and per diem nurse staffing and travel allied health staffing 
travel nurse staffing represented approximately of our total revenue and of our nurse and allied staffing business segment revenue 
other nurse and allied staffing services include the placement of per diem nurses and allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists and respiratory therapists 
our physician staffing business segment represented approximately of revenue and consists of temporary physician staffing services locum tenens 
our clinical trials services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of service offerings that include traditional staffing  as we ll as clinical trials management  drug safety monitoring and regulatory services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers 
our other human capital management services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of education and training and retained search services 
we believe the long term macro drivers of our business are demographic in nature and consist of a growing and aging us population demanding more healthcare services and an aging workforce of healthcare professionals 
there are projected shortages of registered nurses rns and physicians 
the supply of healthcare professionals in the marketplace is dependent upon the number of rns and physicians entering their respective professions versus retiring from the workforce 
in the short term  demand for our healthcare staffing services during was significantly reduced due to the negative impact that the labor and financial markets had on our customers as a result of the steep economic down turn that began during the fall of for the year ended december   our revenue was million  and we generated net income of million  or per diluted share 
net income includes million million after taxes in impairment charges and million million after tax related to an accrual for a legal settlement charge 
the impairment charge is a result of our decision to consolidate our non staffing brands within our clinical trials services business segment to gain operating efficiencies 
the legal settlement charge relates to a class action lawsuit 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations and reduced our debt by million 
we ended the year with total debt of million and million of cash  resulting in a ratio of debt  net of cash  to total capitalization of 
in general  we evaluate the company s financial condition and operating results by revenue  contribution income see segment information  and net income loss 
we also use measurement of our cash flow generation and operating and leverage ratios to help us assess our financial condition 
in addition  we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of orders  contract bookings  number of ftes  days filled and price 
in varying degrees  in  each of our businesses results were impacted by a challenging business environment  with the impact of the recession being most severe on our nurse and allied staffing business 
at the same time  we have also experienced improvements in certain business metrics which we believe are indicators of future revenue growth  particularly in our nurse and allied staffing business segment as noted below 
nurse and allied staffing our nurse and allied staffing services business segment is headquartered in boca raton  florida 
our travel staffing business is operated from a relatively centralized business model servicing all of the assignment needs of our field employees and client facilities through operation centers located in boca raton  florida  malden  massachusetts  newtown square  pennsylvania  tampa  florida  and norcross  georgia 
our per diem staffing operations are provided through a network of branch offices serving major metropolitan markets predominantly located on the east and west coasts of the us our nurse and allied staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of nurses and demand for our staffing services at healthcare facilities 
demand for our healthcare staffing services is primarily influenced by the strength or weakness of national acute care hospital admissions relative to expectations and the volume of patients at other medical facilities  as well as labor market dynamics that influence the number of hours worked by healthcare professionals 
we also believe demand for travel nurse staffing services will be favorably impacted in the long term by an aging population and an increasing shortage of nurses 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare professionals who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare professionals could limit our ability to fill o pen orders and grow our revenue and net income 
in general  we believe nurses are more willing to seek travel assignments during relatively high levels of demand for contract employment  and conversely  are more reluctant to seek travel assignments during and immediately following periods of weak demand for contract employment 
cross country staffing is our core staffing brand that markets its staffing services to hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the us  as well as operates differentiated recruiting brands to recruit registered nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
as a part of its business strategy  cross country staffing is pursuing and implementing exclusive and preferred provider relationships with hospital clients 
cross country staffing provides clients with a suite of solutions to facilitate the efficient management of their temporary workforce while decreasing overall operating costs 
these range from efficiency enhancing technology to full vendor management solutions 
we operate differentiated nurse and allied recruiting brands including cross country travcorps  medstaff  novapro  cross country local  allied health group  cru and assignment america to recruit nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
we believe that these professionals are attracted to us because we offer a wide range of diverse assignments at attractive locations  competitive compensation and benefit packages  as well as high levels of customer service 
typically  as admissions increase for our hospital customers  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as admissions decline  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their staff employees 
in general  we evaluate the nurse and allied staffing business segment s financial condition and operating results by revenue and contribution income see segment information 
in addition  we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of open orders  contract bookings  number of ftes and bill rate per hour of service provided 
our results for were impacted by a very challenging environment particularly in the first half of the year 
during that time  the environment for our nurse and allied staffing services reflected both hospital admission trends that have been largely flat since the first quarter of and a deteriorating national labor market resulting in higher levels of unemployment that translated into more uninsured people and fewer people with commercial health insurance coverage 
our hospital clients had been increasingly reluctant to commit to contract nurses  most often citing low patient census and financial pressures as factors for their hesitation 
in addition  the dramatic deterioration in the economy and national labor markets since the third quarter of likely encouraged full and part time nurses to work more hours directly for hospitals  thus greatly reducing the hospital industry s reliance on the type of outsourced labor we provide 
in the fourth quarter of our nurse and allied staffing volume increased over the third quarter of in addition  in the second half of  relative travel nurse bookings  defined as net weeks booked as a percentage of the average number of fte s on assignment  averaged  as compared to in the first half of it takes several months for sequential volume growth to materialize after booking trends begin to improve due to the typical three month contract length and the normal one month delay from the time a contract is booked to the assignment start date 
this improvement in relative bookings has resulted from an increase in orders from the very low demand we had in spring 
however  despite this increase  our demand remains well below historical norms 
physician staffing we added the physician staffing business segment in with the acquisition of mda holdings  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  mda as described in the acquisitions section which follows 
mda is headquartered in norcross  georgia and offers multi specialty locum tenens temporary physician staffing services to the healthcare industry in all states 
our physician staffing business revenue and earnings are impacted by the demand for temporary physician staffing services and the supply of qualified physicians 
when there are not enough physicians to fill the number of vacancies at hospitals  practice groups or other healthcare facilities  demand increases for our services 
the supply of physicians available for our physician staffing services is variable and is influenced by several factors  including the desire of physicians to work temporary assignments versus being in private practice or on staff or employed at healthcare facilities  the desire of older physicians to work fewer hours  work lifestyle balance especially among younger physicians  and the trend toward more female physicians in the workforce looking to work fewer hours than male counterparts 
in general  we believe that in periods when they are looking for more flexibility  have concerns with lack of malpractice insurance  or they do not want to manage a practice  supply increases 
in periods where the physicians are looking for more stability  supply decreases 
demand and supply constraints may vary based on the specialty of the physician 
we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators for each specialty area of this business  such as physician staffing days filled and revenue per days filled 
in addition  we monitor this segment s revenue  contribution income and contribution income as a percentage or revenue 
we believe the recent recession  the stock market decline and the weakened housing market have delayed the retirement plans of many older physicians 
this dynamic  in conjunction with fewer surgeries  has resulted in a decrease in demand for temporary physicians  particularly in such specialties as anesthesiology 
we also believe that hospitals and medical groups have experienced financial pressures on their operations which have resulted in less utilization of temporary physicians 
despite this decrease in current demand  we believe the long term demographic drivers of this business have not changed 
these drivers include an aging population demanding more healthcare  an aging physician population from the baby boom generation nearing retirement age  and more females entering the profession  which historically have provided less hours of service 
due to these factors  we believe the long term prospects for an acute physician shortage is just as strong now as it was before the current downturn 
clinical trials services our clinical trials services business segment is headquartered at the research triangle park rtp in durham  north carolina 
we provide a flexible range of traditional contract staffing  drug safety monitoring  regulatory consulting and clinical research outsourcing services to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  as well as contract research organization cro customers 
we market these services through multiple brand offerings that have allowed us to establish a significant geographic footprint in the us along with an important presence in the european market 
our clinical trials services revenue and earnings are impacted by the number of trials being planned by pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies 
as a result  we are impacted by our customer s ability to obtain financing for research and development efforts 
we believe that pharmaceutical and biotech companies will continue to need to enhance their product pipelines and conduct human clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety 
we can provide our customers with a broad range of services  from pre clinical through post marketing 
we rely on our ability to recruit and maintain professionals who possess the skills  experience  and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
the supply of clinical trials personnel in the marketplace is relatively stable and comprised primarily of healthcare professionals who have left basic care to pursue clinical research opportunities and individuals with the ed ucation and experience in life sciences 
the supply of people available for our clinical trials services is dependent on the number of clinical trials professionals not currently employed in ongoing trials  as well as new people entering the industry 
the environment for clinical trials services has been weak during the year stemming from a slow down in clinical trials caused largely by economic factors and financial market conditions  along with uncertainty concerning research and development activities following mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors 
we are seeing gradual improvement in the core contract staffing component of our business while continuing to experience weakness in our other service offerings due to project specific factors in our cro activities and in drug safety monitoring activities 
despite the recent weaknesses  we believe an expanding and aging population will drive development of new drug treatments and higher overall demand for drug utilization  which will drive long term growth for this business segment 
other human capital management services education and training services our cross country education cce subsidiary  headquartered in brentwood  tennessee  provides continuing education programs to the healthcare industry 
cce offers one day seminars and e learning  as well as national and regional conferences on topics relevant to nurses and other healthcare professionals 
in  cce held more than  seminars and conferences that were attended by more than  registrants in cities across the us we extend these educational services to our field employees on favorable terms as a recruitment and retention tool 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and lasting through the first half of  many healthcare practitioners delayed or deferred their normal continuing educational activities 
cce s largest market segment is made up of a variety of behavioral health topics and attended by professionals  most of whom personally bear the cost of these continuing educational activities 
consequently  due to economic factors this market segment showed the most significant reduction in seminar attendance during this period 
the second largest market segment consists of allied professionals who are less sensitive to external factors  since their continuing educational expenses are more often than not reimbursed by their employer 
even so  employer education budget cuts impacted allied practitioners to some degree 
in the second half of  we experienced increased attendance by professionals in most markets served due to their respective licensing re quirements 
generally  the continuing education industry continues to experience increased interest in e learning as well as in house opportunities across all professions served  as many times they are more cost effective to the purchaser 
retained search our cejka search subsidiary  headquartered in creve coeur  missouri  is a nationally recognized retained search organization that provides physician and executive search services throughout the us exclusively to the healthcare industry  including physician group practices  hospitals and health systems  academic medical centers  managed care  and other healthcare organizations 
the restricted credit market  high unemployment and sharp economic decline in late and through impacted many hospitals  health systems and medical groups  which are our primary clients 
as healthcare organizations delayed expansion  experienced volume disruptions and suffered operating revenue shortfalls  they reduced or cancelled medical staff recruitment plans  and froze or down sized administrative staffing at all levels 
the sharp drop in the stock market caused physicians to delay retirement  while declining housing values and reduced employment opportunities for trailing spouses made relocation unattractive to physicians and executives 
these factors substantially reduced the demand for permanent search  particularly through mid year reconfiguration of the sales model  in both physician and healthcare executive search  along with diversification of recruitment and physician sourcing services  contributed to improved sales trends in the later part of history in july  an affiliate of charterhouse group  inc charterhouse and certain members of management acquired the assets of cross country staffing  our predecessor  from w

other identifiable intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
the impairment or disposal of long lived asset subsection of the property  plant and equipment topic of the fasb asc  requires us to test the recoverability of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable

comparison of results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue from services revenue from services decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower revenue from our nurse and allied staffing business segment as well as decreases in our clinical trials services and other human capital management services business segments  partially offset by the added revenue of mda 
excluding the impact of the mda acquisition  consolidated revenue from services decreased million or  reflecting a challenging operating environment for all of our business segments 
nurse and allied staffing revenue from our nurse and allied staffing business segment decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily due to lower volume 
the decline in staffing volume reflects a weakening national labor market on the demand for our services  as well as the impact of the liquidity crisis on our hospital customers cost of capital 
the average number of nurse and allied staffing ftes on contract during the year ended december   decreased from the year ended december  average nurse and allied staffing revenue per ftes decreased approximately in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a higher mix of per diem staffing operations  which tend to have lower average bill rates than travel staffing and a shift in mix toward lower skilled professionals within our per diem staffing operations 
the average bill rate in our travel staffing operations increased 
physician staffing revenue from our physician staffing business was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we established the physician staffing business in september with our acquisition of mda 
accordingly  results for the year ended december   include the physician staffing business since its effective date of acquisition 
clinical trials services revenue from clinical trials services decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this decline was primarily due to a decrease in contract staffing volume  several clinical research projects that ended in the third quarter of  a decrease in revenue from a specific drug safety contract  lower direct placement revenue and a decrease in revenue from regulatory contracts 
in addition  a million decrease is attributable to foreign currency translation related to our foreign operations 
other human capital management services revenue from other human capital management services for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million from million in the year ended december   reflecting a decrease in revenue related to the number of retained searches we performed and lower average seminar attendance 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses are comprised primarily of field employee and independent contractor compensation expenses  housing expenses  travel expenses and field insurance expenses 
direct operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  direct operating expenses represented of revenue for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a change in the mix of our business segments along with a widening of our bill pay spread in our travel staffing operations and lower housing costs  partially offset by an increase in workers compensation expense as a percentage of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to lower selling  general and administrative expenses in our organic business segments and lower unallocated corporate overhead  partially offset by the additional expenses from the mda acquisition 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses is unallocated corporate overhead of million for year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  included in unallocated corporate overhead are million and million of share based compensation expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  unallocated corporate overhead was for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were and  respectively  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to negative operating leverage and a change in mix of our business segments 
bad debt expense bad debt expense was not incurred for the year ended december   due to improved collections 
bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenue was  or million for the year ended december  the company s calculation and methodology remain consistent 
contribution income contribution income from our nurse and allied staffing segment for the year ended december   decreased million or  to million from million in year ended december  as a percentage of nurse and allied staffing revenue  segment contribution income was for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to negative operating leverage  partially offset by a widening of our bill pay spread and a moderation in housing costs 
contribution income from our physician staffing segment for the year ended december   was million compared to million in the year ended december  the company established the physician staffing business in september with its acquisition of mda 
accordingly  results for the year ended december  include the physician staffing business since its effective date of acquisition 
as a percentage of physician staffing revenue  contribution income was for the year ended december  and for year ended december  contribution income from clinical trials services for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in the year ended december  as a percentage of clinical trials services revenue  segment contribution income was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december   primarily due to negative operating leverage 
contribution income from other human capital management services for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million  from million in the year ended december  due to lower contribution income from both the retained search and education and training businesses 
contribution income as a percentage of other human capital management services revenue was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december   primarily reflecting the lower number of searches in our retained search business 
our retained search business has the highest fixed cost structure of all of our businesses

see note to the consolidated financial statements acquisitions 
in addition to the above disclosed contractual obligations  the company has accrued uncertain tax positions  pursuant to the income taxes topic of the fasb asc of million at december  based on the uncertainties associated with the settlement of these items  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of potential settlements  if any  with the taxing authorities 
critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  taxes and other contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us a nd on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through december  upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  now incorporated into the business combinations topic of the fasb asc  we ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually  and whenever events of changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
pursuant to the annual testing of goodwill  in the fourth quarters of and we evaluated five reporting units nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  clinical trials services  retained search and education and training 
in the fourth quarter of  we evaluated the four reporting units we had at that time nurse and all ied staffing  clinical trials services  retained search and education and training 
upon completion of the first step in our annual impairment assessment as of december  and  we determined that no impairment was indicated 
for the december  impairment test  we estimated the fair value of each our reporting units based on a weighting of both the income approach and the market approach 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit that served as the primary basis for the income approach were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed within the company 
the forecasts imply a recovery in our businesses in a number of significant assumptions and estimates were involved in the application of the discounted cash flow methodology to forecasted operating cash flows  revenues  margins  discount rate  and working capital changes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of ten years were estimated using a terminal value calculation 
a terminal value growth rate of was used for each reporting unit 
the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash f low discount rates  representing each reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital  ranging from to 
the market approach applied pricing multiples derived from publicly traded guideline companies that are comparable to the respective reporting unit  to determine its value 
we utilized total enterprise value revenue multiples ranging from to and total enterprise value ebitda multiples ranging from to each reporting unit s market value was determined assuming a weighting to revenue and a weighting to ebitda 
the fair value under the market approach included a control premium of  which is an amount we estimate a buyer would be willing to pay in excess of the current market price in order to acquire a controlling interest 
the control premium was determined based on a review of comparative market transactions 
publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of the reporting units 
upon comple tion of the december  assessment  we determined that the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as follows nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  clinical trials services  retained search and education and training 
as a result of the review in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge related to the nurse and allied staffing reporting unit of million  pretax 
the goodwill impairment charge results from a combination of depressed equity market values and lower projected near term growth rates for the nurse and allied staffing business arising from the significant down turn in the us economy and adverse labor and financial markets that deteriorated sharply during the fourth quarter of the majority of the goodwill impairment is attributable to our initial capitalization in  which was accounted for as an asset purchase  and the remainder to subsequent nurse staffing acquisitions made through the impairment test requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount including goodwill as step one 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting units  primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to calculate the implied fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit as determined in step one 
in this step  we must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
this also requires the identification of any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the implied value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount to determine the amount of any impairment charge 
in addition  the property  plant and equipment impairment of disposal of long lived assets topic of the fasb asc  requires us to test the recoverability of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in testing for potential impairment  if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows  we must then determine the amount by which the fair value of those assets exceeds the carrying value and determine the amount of impairment  if any 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted an assessment of a particular trademark and database in our clinical trials services segment due to a change in marketing strategy for the business that indicated the carrying amount of the trademark and database may not be recoverable 
we streamlined our non staffing operations within the c linical trials services segment to gain efficiencies 
based on these circumstances  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge which represented the entire carrying value of this trademark and database of approximately million 
this charge is included in impairment charges on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we concluded that the carrying value of a particular customer relationship in the clinical trials services business segment was higher than its respective estimated fair value and recorded a million impairment charge  pretax 
the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions that required significant judgments  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
changes in these assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
specifically  further deterioration of demand for our services  further deterioration of labor market conditions  reduction of our stock price for an extended period  or other factors as described in item a risk factors  may affect our determination of fair value of each reporting unit 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the fu ture  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
under the current credit agreement an impairment charge will not have an impact on our liquidity 
as of december   we had total goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization of million  net of accumulated amortization 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability policies that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued compensation and benefits on our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial models  as well as industry experience and trends 
if such models indicate that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
healthcare insurance accruals have fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment as well as actual company experience and increases in national healthcare costs 
as of december  and  we had million and millio n accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported health insurance claims 
corporate and field employees are covered through a partially self insured health plan 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of the incurred but not reported health insurance claims accrual related to corporate employees 
workers compensation insurance accruals can fluctuate over time due to the number of employees and inflation  as well as additional exposures arising from the current policy year 
as of december   we had million accrued for incurred but not reported workers compensation claims and retentions  net of related insurance recoveries receivable  a decrease of million over the amount accrued at december  the accrual for workers compensation is based on an actuarial model which is prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary 
as of december   and  we had million and nbsp  million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported professional liability claims and retentions  net of related insurance recoveries receivable 
the accrual for professional liability is based on an actuarial model which is prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write off specific accounts based on an ongoing review of collectibility as well as our past experience with the customer 
historically  losses on uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowances 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
material pending legal proceedings brought against us  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business are described in legal proceedings 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as of december  and  we have deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards for which we have recorded a valuation allowance 
the state carryforwards will expire between and in addition  the tax effect resulting from our goodwill impairment charge recorded in the year ended december   caused the net deferred tax liability position to change to a net deferred tax asset position 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset related to the goodwill impairment charge will be realized in the future with the exception of a specific state portion of the net deferred tax asset for which a valuation allowance has been recorded 
in considering whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider several sources of taxable income  including  but not limited to the following items the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences in the future 
carryback potential to support the utilization of the deferred tax asset 
projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in our determination at december   we relied partially on projections of future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  to reach our conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary on the net deferred tax asset  except as otherwise discussed 
however  if the levels of future taxable income we have projected are not achieved  there is a risk that the company could not recover this entire net deferred tax asset 
we will continue  in the future  to evaluate whether or not the net deferred tax assets will be fully realized prior to expiration 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
an unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the current portion of the unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a component of the income taxes receivable account  and the non current portion is included within other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items  if applicable  which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

the purpose of this update is to clarify that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses either the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets 
this guidance is effective upon issuance 
there was no material impact to us from the adoption of this standard 
seasonality the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment with us is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations which may impact our quarterly revenue and earnings 
hospital patient census and staffing needs of our hospital and healthcare facilities fluctuate which impact our number of orders for a particular period 
many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are located in areas that experience seasonal fluctuations in population during the winter and summer months 
these facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs 
likewise  the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment may fluctuate due to the seasonal preferences for destinations of our temporary nurse and allied professionals 
in addition  we expect our physician staffing business to experience higher demand in the summer months as physicians take vacations 
this historical seasonality of revenue and earnings may vary due to a variety of factors and the results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
in addition  typically  our first quarter results are negatively impacted by the reset of payroll taxes 
inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
this inflation has increased our direct operating costs 
we are also impacted by fluctuations in housing costs and recently by increases in costs of healthcare and workers compensation insurance 
depending on the demand environment  we may be able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments of healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our revolving loan and term loans under our credit agreement  which bears interest based on floating rates 
our term loan bears interest at a rate of  at our option  either i libor plus a leverage based margin or ii base rate plus a leverage based margin 
refer to liquidity and capital resources credit agreement included in item see management s discussion and analysis above for further discussion about our credit agreement and related interest rate swaps 
excluding the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million in  million in and million in considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuatin g approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
our international operations generated less than of our consolidated revenue during the years ending december  and  and were primarily from the united kingdom 
we have not entered into any foreign currency hedges 
our international operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of our non us markets  our reported results vary 
fluctuations in exchange rates also impact the us dollar amount of stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  included in other stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet
