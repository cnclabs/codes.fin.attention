we conduct a significant portion of our operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of our consolidated service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  were from non us operations 
because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our operating results 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in euros and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in pounds sterling 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in euros and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in pounds sterling 
approximately of our contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flows from these contracts typically consist of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  our clients can either terminate their contracts with us upon thirty to sixty days notice or delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or clinical drug manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the product 

table of contents acquisitions acquisitions are an important component of our business strategy 
we account for acquisitions in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  business combinations 
since june   we have completed the following acquisitions clinphone in august  we completed the acquisition of clinphone  one of the world s leading clinical technology organizations  for approximately million  comprised of million for the stock of clinphone and million as repayment of clinphone s existing debt 
we believe that the acquisition of clinphone has advanced our position as a clinical technology leader 
biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly requested technology solutions and expertise to support the full range of clinical development activities while improving the speed and efficiency of clinical programs 
we believe that the broad technological offering that we now provide gives clients a more comprehensive and robust suite of clinical information technologies 
apex in september  we acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of taiwan based apex international clinical research co  ltd 
apex and completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of apex in november for a total of approximately million 
the acquisition strengthened our global capabilities  providing clients with a wider range of clinical research service offerings throughout the asia pacific region  including mainland china  hong kong  india  taiwan  singapore  indonesia  south korea  malaysia  thailand  the philippines  new zealand  and australia 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved or the susceptibility of such matter to change and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition we recognize service revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the service offering has been delivered to the client  iii the collection of fees is probable  and iv amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
our crs client arrangements generally involve multiple service deliverables  where bundled service deliverables are accounted for in accordance with asc  multiple element arrangements 
we have determined that each of our service deliverables has standalone value and have established objective evidence of fair value for each of our service deliverables based on the price charged when sold to other similar customers 
accordingly  revenues are recognized upon delivery of actual units and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
within perceptive s clinphone rtsm business  we offer selected software solutions through hosted applications delivered through a standard web browser 
revenue from hosting service arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the hosting arrangement  including customary and expected extensions 
fees charged and costs incurred in the setup stage of these arrangements are deferred until the start of the hosting period and are amortized and recognized ratably over the estimated hosting period 
within the ctms operating unit of perceptive  software revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis due to the significant nature of customization of each project 
within the edc operating unit of perceptive  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract service period 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or cash received in advance of revenue recognized 

table of contents critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of fair value  stand alone value  hosting period  and other revenue elements 
changes to these elements could affect the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
billed accounts receivable  unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or payments received for which revenue has not yet been earned 
we maintain a provision for losses on receivables based on historical collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of collectability and the amounts required to be recorded as provisions for losses on receivables 
income taxes our global provision for corporate income taxes is determined in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of asc  which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances 
in addition  asc mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in income tax reporting positions 
we are subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities that may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is based on judgment 
we believe we have adequately provided for any uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit below its fair value 
the impairment testing involves determining the fair market value of each of the reporting units with which the goodwill was associated and comparing that value with the reporting unit s carrying value 
we conducted an impairment assessment in fiscal year using a discounted cash flow analysis at the reporting unit level to determine fair value 
this analysis included significant judgment regarding the assumptions used  such as our weighted average cost of capital  revenue growth rates  profit margins  capital expenditures  and other factors that were all based on current strategic forecasts and other financial metrics 
as of june   there were no required adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill since the fair value of our net assets were substantially above the carrying value of our net assets at each of our reporting units 
variations over time in the measures and estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis could result in future impairment of goodwill that could have a material impact to our financial position or our results of operations 

table of contents results of operations note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k provides a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended june  and analysis by segment we evaluate our segment performance and allocate resources based on service revenue and gross profit service revenue less direct costs  while other operating costs are allocated and evaluated on a geographic basis 
accordingly  we do not include the impact of selling  general  and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  interest income expense  other income loss  and income tax expense benefit in segment profitability 
we attribute revenue to individual countries based upon the number of hours of services performed in the respective countries and inter segment transactions are not included in service revenue 
furthermore  we have a global infrastructure supporting our business segments and therefore  assets are not identified by reportable segment

table of contents fiscal year ended june  compared with the fiscal year ended june  for fiscal year  we had net income of million compared with net income of million for fiscal year this increase was due primarily to factors described below

overall  service revenue was positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including million in the americas  million in europe  middle east africa  and million in asia pacific 
on a segment basis  crs service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the growth was attributable to a million increase in phase ii iii pace  the positive million impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and a million increase in early phase 
growth in the phase ii iii pace business has been largely due to the impact of strategic partnerships and increased business activity in the asia pacific region as a result of global studies and more work for local biopharmaceutical companies 
growth in early phase business was a result of increased demand due largely to improvements in the unit s sales team and approach 
pcms service revenue decreased nominally to million for fiscal year from million for the same period in fiscal year the decline was caused by a million decrease in health policy and strategic reimbursement services  which was adversely affected by uncertainty in the regulatory markets due to changes in the us healthcare law  and the million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  partly offset by a million increase in the consulting business  including strong growth in compliance consulting work 
perceptive service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was due to an million increase in clinphone rtsm and support services  a million increase in edc services  and a million increase in medical imaging  partly offset by a million decrease in ctms and installation support services  and the million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the overall increases are due to the trend toward increasing integration of technology into clinical trials 
as of fiscal year  perceptive handled more electronic case report forms than paper based ones 
the decrease in ctms and integration support services was due  in part  to lower demand for perpetual licenses  replaced by increased demand for hosted solutions 
reimbursement revenue consists of reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of and reimbursable by clients 
reimbursement revenue does not yield any gross profit to us  nor does it have an impact on net income

table of contents pcms direct costs decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this million decrease was caused mainly by a lower level of activity in the medical communications business 
as a percentage of service revenue  pcms direct costs decreased to from for the respective periods 
this reduction resulted from efforts by pcms to implement substantial improvements in business processes  mainly related to the strategic marketing portion of the business and the shedding of certain unprofitable service lines 
perceptive direct costs increased slightly by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was due to increases in clinphone rtsm and support services activities and higher spending in ctms and integration support services  partly offset by a decrease in other areas 
this latter decrease was due largely to the fact that we had no counterparts to a million reserve for a customer dispute in medical imaging and million associated with the termination of a pre acquisition perceptive ivr supplier contract  both recorded in fiscal year as a percentage of service revenue  perceptive direct costs decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this million increase was due primarily to a million increase in personnel costs driven in part by bonus expense in fiscal year for which there was no comparable bonus expense in fiscal year  a million increase in sales related costs including commissions  million related to the legal settlement costs related to a small acquisition which was completed several years ago  million in higher rent and office expenses  and million related to the negative impact for foreign currency exchange rate movements

miscellaneous income for fiscal year of million consisted of a million legal settlement charge related to a contract dispute  million for the write off of certain impaired assets  million of losses related to foreign exchange contracts  and million in other losses  partly offset by million of gains on the revaluation of foreign denominated assets liabilities 

table of contents taxes for the fiscal year and  we had an effective income tax rate of and  respectively 
the reduction in the tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the reserves required for uncertain tax positions as of june  and improved profitability in the us fiscal year ended june  compared with the fiscal year ended june  for fiscal year  we had net income of million compared with net income of million for fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to factors described below 
on a fully diluted basis  earnings per share decreased to from for the corresponding periods

the increase in europe  middle east africa was negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million 
excluding that impact  growth in that region would have been approximately 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in the americas and asia pacific regions was minimal 
on a segment basis  crs service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this increase was due primarily to million in additional revenue in the phase ii iii pace portions of the business as a result of continuing strong demand for our services  particularly from the large pharmaceutical segment  and approximately million in incremental revenue from the acquisition of apex  which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal year these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million and a decrease of million in our early phase business  as a result of lower demand caused by uncertainties in the capital markets that led clients to reduce their research and development spending 
pcms service revenue decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for the same period in this decrease was attributable to the million impact of the disposition of barnett educational services and targeted withdrawals from certain other unprofitable service lines in the prior year in the medcom business and million related to foreign currency fluctuations 
these amounts were partly offset by growth of approximately million in parexel consulting that was driven by increased demand by clients for assistance in the new stricter regulatory environment 
perceptive service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this increase was due primarily to the acquisition of clinphone  which contributed million in revenue  partly offset by approximately million related to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and a million decrease in other parts of the business  primarily in our legacy ivr service and our medical imaging units 
the decrease in our legacy ivr product was due primarily to the migration of our clients to the clinphone rtsm product 
clinphone s revenue of million included the million impact of a correction with regard to the accounting treatment for revenue recognition of certain projects involving the clinphone rtsm system and acquisition related deferred revenue 
with regard to certain clinphone rtsm related projects  we had been recognizing start up revenue and costs during the start up period of a study 
however  this start up revenue  totaling approximately million in fiscal year  should have been deferred and recognized ratably over an estimated hosting period 
additionally  we had recognized million of acquired deferred revenue on projects for which the work had been completed prior to our acquisition 
since there was no additional work that needed to be done on those projects after the acquisition date  the fair value of this deferred revenue should have been zero at the time of acquisition

we have a cash pooling arrangement with rbs nederland  nv 
pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the overall net position is used as a basis by the bank for calculating the overall pool interest amount 
each legal entity owned by parexel and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit deposit or a debit overdraft balance 
therefore  interest income is earned by legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged to legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s overall balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 
the gross overdraft balance related to this pooling arrangement was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
however  on a net basis  we have surplus cash balances over all accounts for the respective periods 
we have financing agreements with a vendor to finance software purchases 
the agreements carry four year terms and bear annual interest rates ranging between to 
as of june   the balance on the promissory notes issued in connection with the financing agreements was million 

table of contents financing needs our primary cash needs are for operating expenses  such as salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting  business development and facilities  business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and repayment of principal and interest on our borrowings 
our requirements for cash to pay principal and interest on our borrowings will increase significantly in future periods because we borrowed approximately million under the credit facility in august to finance the acquisition of clinphone 
our only committed external source of funds is under our credit facility described above 
our principal source of cash is from the performance of services under contracts with our clients 
if we were unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients or if the level of contract cancellations increased  our revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected see part ii  item a risk factors for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of our new business bookings or contract cancellations  we believe that our existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs over the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
depending upon our revenue and cash flow from operations  it is possible that we will require external funds to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility upon maturity in we expect to continue to acquire businesses to enhance our service and product offerings  expand our therapeutic expertise  and or increase our global presence 
depending on their size  any future acquisitions may require additional external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
we may be unable to secure such financing at all or on terms acceptable to us  as a result of our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
in addition  under the terms of the credit facility  interest rates are fixed based on market indices at the time of borrowing and  depending upon the interest mechanism selected by us  may float thereafter 
as a result  the amount of interest payable by us on our borrowings may increase if market interest rates change 
we made capital expenditures of approximately million during the twelve months ended june   primarily for computer software including the implementation of a large project accounting system  hardware  and leasehold improvements 
we expect capital expenditures to total approximately to million in fiscal year  primarily for computer software and hardware and leasehold improvements 
on september   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million of our common stock to be repurchased in the open market subject to market conditions 
as of june   we had acquired  shares at a total cost of million under this program 
there were no repurchases made during the twelve months ended june  debt  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and guarantees the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at june  in thousands less than year years years more than years total debt obligations principal operating leases obligations under capital leases purchase obligations total includes commitments to purchase software  hardware  and services 
the above table does not include approximately million of potential tax liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions

we also have an unsecured facility consisting of a term loan facility for million and a revolving credit facility for million with a group of lenders including and managed by jpmorgan chase bank  na that is guaranteed by certain of our na subsidiaries 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors 
restructuring plan in october  we adopted a plan to restructure our operations to reduce expenses  better align costs with current and future geographic sources of revenue  and improve operating efficiencies the restructuring plan 
during fiscal year  we recorded million in restructuring charges in association with the restructuring plan  including approximately million in costs related to the abandonment of certain property leases and million in employee separation benefits associated with the elimination of managerial and staff positions 
we expect to see incremental savings in fiscal year resulting from this plan 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition

 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force eitf formerly eitf 
asu revises fasb asc to drop from its scope all tangible products containing both software and non software components that operate together to deliver the products functions 
it also amends the determination of how arrangement consideration should be allocated to deliverables in a multi deliverable revenue arrangement

in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force formerly eitf  which amends the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
asu addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how to allocate consideration to each unit of accounting in the arrangement 
this asu replaces all references to fair value as the measurement criteria with the term selling price and establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
it also eliminated the use of the residual value method for determining the allocation of arrangement consideration 
asu will be effective for us in fiscal year early adoption is permitted with required transition disclosures based on the period of adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for the twelve months ended june  from operations outside of the us  including denominated in euros and denominated in pounds sterling 
we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for the twelve months ended june  from operations outside of the us  including denominated in euros and denominated in pounds sterling 
we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
it is our policy to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in market rates of interest 
accordingly  we have instituted foreign currency hedging programs and an interest rate swap program 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information on our hedging programs and interest rate swap program 
as of june   the programs with derivatives designated as hedging instruments under asc were deemed effective and the notional values of the derivatives were approximately million  including an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million in connection with the borrowings under our credit facility 
under certain circumstances  such as the occurrence of significant differences between actual cash receipts and forecasted cash receipts  the asc programs could be deemed ineffective 
in that event  the unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives  and currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  would be recognized in earnings 
as of june   the estimated amount that could be recognized in other income was a loss of approximately million  net of tax 
as of june   the notional value of derivatives that were not designated as hedging instruments under asc was approximately million 
the potential change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts that would result from a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would be approximately million 
during the twelve months ended june  and  we recorded foreign exchange losses of million and foreign exchange gains of million  respectively 
we acknowledge our exposure to additional foreign exchange risk as it relates to assets and liabilities that are not part of the economic hedge program  but quantification of this risk is difficult to assess at any given point in time 
our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to the amount of our short term and long term debt 
short term debt was million at june  and million at june  long term debt was million at june  and million at june  marketable securities during the third quarter of fiscal year  we purchased marketable securities in foreign government treasury certificates that are actively traded 
we expect to hold these securities to maturity and have elected to account for them under the fair value option as outlined in asc as of june   the value of these marketable securities was million 
since the counterparty is a stable sovereign and due to the relatively short terms of maturity less than one year  we do not believe that these investments are at high risk of default 
nevertheless  these investments are still at risk for adverse changes in market rates and prices
