overview established in as a truck body manufacturer  supreme industries  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiary supreme corporation  is one of the nation s leading manufacturers of specialized commercial vehicles 
utilizing a nationwide direct sales and distribution network  as well as manufacturing and service facilities in nine states across the continental united states  supreme is able to meet the needs of customers across all of north america 
the company engages principally in the production and sale of customized truck bodies  buses  and other specialty vehicles 
building on its expertise in providing both cargo and passenger transportation solutions  the company s specialty offerings include products such as customized armored vehicles  homeland response vehicles  and portable storage units 

table of contents the company and its product offerings are sensitive to various factors which include  but are not limited to  economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  volatility in the supply chain of vehicle chassis  and the availability of credit and financing to the company  our vendors  dealers  or end users 
the company s business is also affected by the availability and costs of certain raw materials that serve as significant components of its product offerings 
the company s risk factors are disclosed in item a risk factors of this document 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto located in item of this document and pertain to continuing operations unless otherwise noted 
results of operations comparison of with for the year ended  supreme continued to experience significantly lower demand for its core dry freight trucks 
we endured recession related weak demand in the commercial truck market which resulted in a year over year decline in unit shipments which was in addition to the decrease in unit shipments experienced in as compared with as core dry freight trucks and related products having historically represented approximately of our revenues  our total revenues have been dramatically affected by these conditions 
in our efforts to ultimately emerge from the current economic environment as one of the strongest companies in our industry  we continued to execute on our strategy of cost containment  production efficiencies  market expansion  and product diversification 
by the end of  we had reduced our annualized operating costs by more than million but were unable to adjust our cost structure rapidly enough to avoid losses for the past two years  which were the first loss years in the company s year history 
we continue to look for opportunities to make our operations leaner and have implemented additional cost reductions that should be realized in the cumulative cost reductions have been derived from  among other factors  personnel and salary reductions  suspension of the company s k contributions  process improvements  plant closures and consolidations  outsourcing  and improved inventory management 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company terminated its silver crown luxury motorhome business and has reclassified prior period results accordingly as discontinued operations 
the unprecedented tight credit markets caused by the severe economic recession led to a significant reduction of new motorhome orders and the cancellation of existing orders 
during the year  we also incurred production start up costs in both our pennsylvania and oregon bus operations as we expanded capacity in those locations to meet the recent increase in bus demand 
having taken the above described actions  we believe that we are more competitively positioned and look forward to achieving earnings when revenues improve from either core truck or other products 
in our effort to increase revenues  we have invested in product improvements  technology  and our sales organization 
we also increased efforts to sell product lines that have reasonable continuing market demand ie buses  armored vehicles  etc 
while pursuing profitable dry freight orders as business conditions permit 
with recent improvements to our new signature body and improved production processes  we believe that our truck division is well positioned to capitalize on an increase in demand for dry freight units 
further  we continually work to improve our operational processes  researching new materials to increase value to our customers with an emphasis on green materials and technologies  while also upgrading existing and developing new product offerings 
we believe that the commercial truck market is poised for a rebound since the average age of fleet vehicles in use is estimated to be more than nine years compared with the historic average of seven years 
some industry analysts are predicting truck sales to increase by double digits in each of the next two years 
with supreme s product diversification  cost reductions  and overall market share  we are positioned for a meaningful improvement in our financial performance if these predictions hold true 
however  in the event the dry freight truck demand remains low and does not rebound from current levels during  we will take additional measures to improve our financial performance while continuing to push for increased revenues from other product groups 

table of contents finally  the company s focus on asset management continues as evidenced by our total debt to equity ratio which improved since the beginning of  along with a total debt level decrease of or million 
net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared with million for the year ended december  the following table presents the components of net sales and the changes from to s omitted change specialized vehicles trucks buses armored vehicles composites we attribute the decrease in our truck product sales primarily to the economic recession which resulted in an industry wide decline in demand within the retail truck market 
this  combined with decreased orders from major fleet customers in  resulted in a revenue decrease of almost for the year when compared to the year 
based on industry data  we do not believe that we lost market share during and but rather the domestic dry freight industry demand declined dramatically as a result of the overall economic conditions 
according to the polk commercial vehicle market intelligence report  calendar year represented the lowest total for new commercial vehicle registrations in a calendar year since polk started tracking the data in although sales were down million for the year  our startrans bus division continued to experience good demand due in part to the availability of funds from the federal economic stimulus plan and an increased use of more economical public transportation 
with our recently expanded capacity and our strong backlog for this division  we anticipate continued favorable contributions from our bus division in the armored division sales increase of million was primarily the result of our contract with the us department of state to produce armored suburbans for embassies abroad 
we believe that the armored division is also well positioned for due to the increased backlog and the positive response we are receiving from other governmental agencies regarding our armored product offerings and product quality 
the decrease in composite sales of fiberglass reinforced plywood and other fiberglass products of million was due to the overall decline in the commercial truck market 
the company s sales backlog began to increase during the final quarter of reaching its highest level in more than a year and was up to million at december  as compared with million at the end of december the improved backlog is related to increased demand for buses and armored vehicles while the truck backlog decreased from the prior year and was quite low when compared with backlog levels in more normal economic conditions 
although not reflected in our year end backlog levels  increased quoting activity in most of the company s sales territories  as well as signs of stabilization in the commercial truck market  have been observed 

table of contents cost of sales and gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the following table presents the components of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and the changes from to percent change material direct labor overhead delivery cost of sales gross profit material material cost as a percentage of net sales increased by for the year ended december  as compared with the change in the material percentage was primarily related to changes in our product mix reflecting our increased sales in our bus division  which has a higher material percentage than our core truck products  and accounted for of our total net sales in compared to for the same period in the material percentage for the truck division increased slightly during the year resulting from higher sales discounts to win sales orders and due to producing more specialized truck units 
raw material costs have recently stabilized for certain commodities  particularly for aluminum and steel products 
the company closely monitors all major commodities and continually reviews the financial viability of its primary vendors 
we also strive to reduce manufacturing costs through the use of improved technologies  processes  and supply chain management tactics and strategies 
direct labor the direct labor as a percentage of net sales was unchanged for the year ended december  as compared with during this economic downturn the company has worked toward improving the overall direct labor percentage and continues its effort in this regard 
overhead overhead as a percentage of net sales increased by for the year ended december  as compared with the majority of the increase in the overhead percentage was due to the fixed nature of certain expenses that do not fluctuate when sales volume changes 
additionally  group health insurance expense was higher than anticipated as a result of a few large medical claims 
in an effort to control its health care costs  the company continues to implement changes to its employee benefit plan design with an increased focus on preventive care 
we continue to focus on reducing operating expenses and managing our overhead cost structure based on prevailing sales levels 
delivery delivery as a percentage of net sales decreased by for the year ended december  as compared with the company continues to utilize more cost effective delivery methods to counteract the adverse impact of high fuel costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative g a expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the following table presents selling and g a expenses as a percentage of net sales and the changes from to 
table of contents s omitted change selling expenses g a expenses total selling expenses selling expenses declined for the year ended december  as compared with the decrease was a result of lower commission expense  selling wages  and other employee related expenses due to lower sales volumes and several proactive cost reduction efforts 
these declines were partially offset by fewer cooperative marketing credits the company received from chassis manufacturers 
g a expenses g a expenses decreased for the year ended december  as compared with the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced employee headcount and the related payroll and benefits which are a large part of the cost savings initiatives begun in mid the increase as a percentage of sales was due to the fixed nature of certain g a expenses that do not fluctuate when sales volume changes 
other income for the year ended december   other income was million of net sales as compared with million of net sales for the year december  other income consisted of rental income  gain on sale of assets  and other miscellaneous income received by the company 
interest expense interest expense was million of net sales for the year ended december  as compared with million of net sales for the year ended december  the increased bank interest expense reflected higher interest rates under the company s credit facility due to recent operating losses 
this was somewhat offset by lower prevailing libor and prime interest rates coupled with reduced debt levels due to lower working capital requirements 
chassis interest expense increased due to the slowdown in the light duty truck market causing a build up of consigned chassis inventory 
the company continuously monitors the age of consigned chassis with the objective of minimizing chassis interest expense 
income taxes the company s estimated effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared with for the year ended december  the estimated effective income tax rate for both periods were favorably impacted by tax benefits associated with the company s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  federal alternative fuel tax credits  and research and development tax credits 
the combination of these tax benefits along with the incurred pretax losses resulted in an overall tax benefit position for the company in each of the and years 
net loss net loss from continuing operations increased by million to million of net sales for the year ended december  from a net loss of million of net sales for the year ended december  
table of contents discontinued operations as noted earlier  the company terminated its silver crown luxury motorhome business and has reclassified prior period results accordingly as discontinued operations 
the unprecedented tight credit markets caused by the severe economic recession led to a significant reduction of new motorhome orders and the cancellation of existing orders 
the after tax loss from discontinued operations related to our silver crown recreational vehicle division was million in and million in basic and diluted loss per share the following table presents basic and diluted loss per share and the changes from to change basic and diluted net loss per share loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss comparison of with discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  the company terminated its silver crown luxury motorhome business and has reclassified prior period results accordingly as discontinued operations 
as a result  certain amounts in the comparison of with have been adjusted to reflect the reported discontinued operations to conform to the presentation

general the following consolidated results of operations pertain to continuing operations unless otherwise noted 
net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily related to our truck body sales  our largest product group  which declined by million 
our armored truck division and composite division experienced a decline in net sales of million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in net sales by our startrans bus division of million  or  to million for the year ended december  the following table presents the components of net sales and the changes from to s omitted change specialized vehicles trucks buses armored vehicles composites 
table of contents we attributed the decrease in our truck product sales to the economic recession which resulted in an industry wide decline in the retail truck market 
additionally  truck products were negatively impacted in the first half of by the cancellation of approximately million of orders from a major fleet customer due to the disruption in the supply of general motors gm chassis resulting from a labor dispute between the united auto workers and gm s axle supplier 
this labor dispute was settled in the second quarter  but returning to normal conditions was further delayed by a second labor strike against a chassis delivery provider which was later resolved 
the disruption adversely affected our profitability and resulted in excess inventory carrying costs for both our fleet and retail business during the first half of the armored division sales decline was the result of the economic environment and the highly competitive nature of the cash in transit business 
startrans bus division continued to experience strong demand resulting from increased use of mass transit due to the volatility of fuel prices and increased ridership as more individuals conserve energy to live a green life style 
total sales backlog was million at december  as compared with million at december  cost of sales and gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the following table presents the components of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and the changes from to percent change material direct labor overhead delivery cost of sales gross profit material material cost as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended december  as compared with the change in the material percentage was primarily related to higher raw material costs and product mix 
our change in product mix related to our bus division  which had a higher material percentage and accounted for a of our total sales in compared to for the same period in raw material costs  particularly for aluminum  steel  and petroleum based products  increased in we attempted to address the unavoidable raw material cost increases by increasing the prices of our products to the limited extent that our highly competitive markets permitted 
we announced price increases of and in march and june  respectively  on all core truck product lines 
our startrans bus division implemented price increases of and effective in january and june  respectively 
we also strived to reduce manufacturing costs through the use of technology ie  robotics  innovative materials  etc  lean manufacturing  and improved processes 
the ongoing efforts  as well as product diversification and the introduction of our signature van body  helped us to mitigate the effect of any future increases in raw material costs 
direct labor direct labor as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended december  as compared with the slight increase in the direct labor percentage was the result of inefficiencies resulting from the labor strikes as discussed previously  timing of fleet customer buying patterns  and the normal startup costs of additional production lines to fulfill fleet orders 
additionally  our startrans bus division experienced an increase in its labor percentage due to employee training costs associated with our regional plants bus production line start up costs 
the expanded capacity improved plant utilization while accelerating delivery to satisfy our bus backlog 

table of contents overhead overhead as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended december  as compared with the majority of the increase in the overhead percentage was due to the fixed nature of certain expenses that do not fluctuate when sales volume changes 
the company also experienced higher costs for research and development which was associated with the investments in signature van body and the armored suburban contract 
during  the company reduced its cost and benefited from changes to its group health insurance plan design

partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in commission expense resulting from the lower sales volume in when compared to g a expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of the decrease in pretax income 
additionally  we incurred one time professional fees during related to complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
goodwill was tested for impairment at december  and due primarily to the depressed market price of the company s class a common stock and consequent difference between the market capitalization and book value of the company  management recorded an impairment charge against the full balance of this asset

because of the prevailing industry conditions  the company s board of directors suspended paying cash dividends effective as of february  future dividends will be subject to business conditions  the company s financial position  and requirements for working capital  property  plant  and equipment expenditures  and other corporate purposes 
capital resources during the quarter ended december   supreme corporation  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  was not in compliance with an earnings related covenant and a minimum tangible net worth covenant in its credit agreement 
the company is in the process of obtaining an amendment to the credit agreement that will waive the covenant defaults and suspend the measurements until the second quarter of to provide the company  with the assistance of consultants engaged in february  time to refine and implement its profit improvement plan 
additionally  the amendment will require the company and its subsidiaries to pledge all assets as collateral under the credit agreement 
management  based on discussions with the bank  is reasonably confident that in the near future the company will conclude a satisfactory amendment with the bank 
despite the non compliance with covenants  the company has made every scheduled payment of principal and interest on a timely basis 
the remaining terms of the credit agreement are substantially the same as the previous credit agreement disclosed in the annual report on form k for the year ended december  
table of contents during the third quarter  and as a result of previous covenant violations  management changed the classification of the company s bank revolving credit facility obligations from a long term liability to a current liability 
management was of the opinion that the company may not be able to cure potential covenant defaults at measurement dates that are within the next twelve months 
this reclassification had no effect on previously reported consolidated statement of operations or consolidated statement of cash flows for the year 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the bank revolving line of credit is based on the bank s prime rate  or certain basis points above libor  depending on the pricing option selected and the company s leverage ratio effective rate of and at december  and december   respectively 
summary of liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital requirements are to support working capital demands  meet its debt service obligations  and finance capital expenditure requirements 
the company has a substantial asset collateral base which it believes is more than sufficient to support the outstanding revolving line of credit balance 
further  additional liquidity is obtained through selling products and collecting the resulting trade accounts receivable 
the funds collected are used to pay creditors  employees  and to fund working capital requirements 
the company s cash management system and revolving line of credit are designed to maintain zero cash balances and  accordingly  checks outstanding in excess of bank balances are classified as additional borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
as of december   the company had million utilized under its million credit facility 
the company believes that it has adequate availability under its current bank credit facility and sufficient additional liquidity resources to finance working capital requirements for contractual obligations the company s fixed  noncancelable obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years debt a operating leases b total a amounts are included on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters 
b see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding property leases 
the company s historical practice has been to exclude the interest payments from the contractual obligations table due to the variability of its interest rates and the variability in its revolving line of credit which represented of its debt obligations at december  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  inventory relief  accrued insurance  accrued warranty  and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue when products are shipped to the customer 
revenue on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions is recognized after the customer is notified that the products have been completed according to customer specifications  have passed all of the company s quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery based on established delivery terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would adversely affect our future operating results 
excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of raw materials and finished products and provide for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand  and or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would adversely affect future operating results 
inventory relief for monthly and quarterly financial reporting  cost of sales is recorded and inventories are relieved by the use of standard bills of material adjusted for scrap and other estimated factors affecting inventory relief 
because of our large and diverse product line and the customized nature of each order  it is difficult to place full reliance on the bills of material for accurate relief of inventories 
although the company continues to refine the process of creating accurate bills of materials  manual adjustments which are based on estimates are necessary in an effort to assure correct relief of inventories for products sold 
the calculations to estimate costs not captured in the bill of materials take into account the customized nature of products  historical inventory relief percentages  scrap variances  and other factors which could impact inventory relief 
the accuracy of the inventory relief is not fully known until physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s locations 
we conduct semi annual physical inventories at a majority of locations and schedule them in a manner that provides coverage in each of our calendar quarters 
we have invested significant resources in our continuing effort to improve the physical inventory process and accuracy of our inventory accounting system 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier  and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates  and any subsequent changes in estimates  may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future 
the company utilizes a wholly owned small captive insurance company to insure certain of its business risks 
certain risks  traditionally self insured by the company and its subsidiaries  are insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
the captive insurance subsidiary helps the company manage its risk exposures and  under the internal revenue code  the net underwriting income of such a small captive is not taxable 
accrued warranty the company provides limited warranties for periods of up to five years from the date of retail sale 
estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of sale and are based upon historical experience 

table of contents impairment of goodwill the company has a policy of evaluating the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flows approach and consideration of the company s aggregate market value of its common stock 
as of december   the company did not carry a goodwill balance 
for the year ended december   the carrying amount of the company s specialized vehicles reporting unit exceeded its fair value which required a measurement of the impairment loss 
the impairment loss was calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the company has determined there was no excess fair value over the amount assigned to the reporting unit s other assets and liabilities 
an impairment loss was recognized for the full carrying value of the goodwill which totaled  at december  impairment of intangible assets the company evaluates the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset 
the company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  an impairment loss is recognized 
the impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company estimates the value of its customer list based on various valuation techniques including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires the company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment  and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
as of december   the company did not carry an intangible asset balance 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge for the full carrying amount of its customer list which totaled  pending accounting pronouncements see recent accounting pronouncements in note of notes to consolidated financial statements
