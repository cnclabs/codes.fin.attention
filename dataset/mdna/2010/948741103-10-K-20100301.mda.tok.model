item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants 
executive overview weingarten realty investors is a real estate investment trust reit organized under the texas real estate investment trust act 
effective january   the texas real estate investment trust act was replaced by the texas business organizations code 
we  and our predecessor entity  began the ownership and development of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping and industrial centers we own or lease 
we also manage centers for joint ventures in which we are partners or for other outside owners for which we charge fees 
we operate a portfolio of rental properties which includes neighborhood and community shopping centers and industrial properties of approximately million square feet 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of total rental revenues during our long term strategy is to focus on increasing funds from operations ffo and shareholder value 
we do this through hands on leasing  management and selected redevelopment of the existing portfolio of properties  through disciplined growth from selective acquisitions and new developments  and through the disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
we do this while remaining committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 
during  the depressed economic environment and capital markets caused us to refocus our efforts on maintaining our operating properties at current levels and managing our capital resources to ensure adequate liquidity needed to address our upcoming debt maturities 
accordingly  we have taken a number of steps in as described below we issued million common shares of beneficial interest common shares resulting in additional liquidity of million 
these proceeds were used to fund the repurchases of million principal of unsecured fixed rate medium term notes  senior unsecured notes and convertible senior unsecured notes  significantly reducing our debt maturities for the years through although our convertible senior unsecured notes do not mature until  we believe market conditions make it highly probable they will be put back to us in we issued million of secured debt 
we issued million of unsecured notes payable 
we entered into a joint venture to which we have contributed six properties valued at million and to date have received net proceeds of approximately million and a cash distribution of secured debt proceeds totaling million 
we contributed the final four properties to a joint venture valued at approximately million and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we have sold operating and merchant build properties for approximately million 
as a result of these transactions  we have built adequate levels of liquidity and reduced our debt maturities to very manageable levels 
we were able to reduce our debt maturities including our revolver balance and the unsecured convertible debt due in with put options in in  and from billion at december  to million as of december   which  at this time  we are highly confident can be refinanced or extinguished upon maturity 
in february  we successfully renegotiated our revolver credit facility for million which matures in february as of february   no amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and we had excess cash primarily invested in short term investments totaling million 
looking forward to  we will continue to focus our efforts on improving our operating fundamentals and increasing shareholder value 
we are also positioning ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities as the markets begin to improve 
we are implementing a multifaceted approach to utilizing associates from leasing  acquisitions and new development to source these opportunities 
we are also leveraging their efforts with the relationships we have in the brokerage  banking and institutional arenas 
while the number of attractive acquisition and redevelopment opportunities entering the market has been minimal  we are focused on being properly positioned once the markets improve 
we strive to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure  which provides ready access to a variety of attractive capital sources 
we carefully balance obtaining low cost financing with minimizing exposure to interest rate movements and matching long term liabilities with the long term assets acquired or developed 
while the availability and pricing of capital has improved since the beginning of the year  there can be no assurance that such pricing and availability will not deteriorate in the near future 
at december   we owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties and properties under various stages of construction and development 
the total number of centers includes neighborhood and community shopping centers  industrial projects and three other operating properties located in states spanning the country from coast to coast 
we also owned interests in parcels of land held for development that totaled approximately million square feet 
we had approximately  leases with  different tenants at december  leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
rental revenues generally include minimum lease payments  which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
through this challenging economic environment  we believe stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
in assessing the performance of our properties  management carefully tracks the occupancy of the portfolio 
the weakened economy contributed to a drop in our occupancy from at december  to at december  while we will continue to monitor the economy and the effects on our retailers  we believe the significant diversification of our portfolio both geographically and by tenant base and the quality of our portfolio  will allow us to maintain occupancy levels of above as we move through next year  absent bankruptcies by multiple national or regional tenants 
another important indicator of performance is the spread in rental rates on a same space basis as we complete new leases and renew existing leases 
we completed  new leases or renewals during totaling million square feet  increasing rental rates an average of on a cash basis 
new development at december   we had properties in various stages of development 
we have funded million to date on these projects and  at completion  we estimate our investment to be million  net of proceeds from land sales and tax incentive financing of million 
these properties are slated to be completed over the next one to four years with a projected return on investment of approximately when completed 
we have approximately million  net of impairment charges  in land held for development pending improvement in economic conditions 
due to our analysis of current economic considerations  including the effects of tenant bankruptcies  lack of credit available to retailers and the suspension of tenant expansion plans for new development projects and declines in real estate values  our plans related to our new development properties including land held for development changed  and resulted in impairment charges 
impairments  primarily related to undeveloped land at our new development properties  of million and million were recognized during and  respectively 
while we will continue to monitor this market closely  we anticipate little if any investment in land held for development or new projects for merchant development is a program where we acquire or develop a project with the objective of selling all or part of it  instead of retaining it in our portfolio on a long term basis 
disposition of land parcels are also included in this program 
we generated gains from this program during of approximately million 
our business plan calls for no material merchant development sales 
acquisitions and joint ventures acquisitions are a key component of our long term strategy  and joint venture arrangements are key to both our current and long term strategy 
however  the turmoil in the capital markets and current economic conditions have significantly reduced transactions in the marketplace and  therefore  created uncertainty with respect to pricing 
partnering with institutional investors through real estate joint ventures enables us to acquire high quality assets in our target markets while also meeting our financial return objectives 
we benefit from access to lower cost capital  as well as leveraging our expertise to provide fee based services  such as acquisition  leasing  property management and asset management  to the joint ventures 
there were no acquisitions of operating properties during  and we do not anticipate any material purchases through the mid year of in october  we entered into an agreement to contribute six retail properties  located in florida and georgia  valued at approximately million to an unconsolidated joint venture in which we will retain a ownership interest 
in  we closed on four florida properties with a total value of million  aggregating million square feet and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we sold an interest in this joint venture to an institutional investor  and realized a gain of million 
subsequent to december   two additional properties were contributed to the unconsolidated joint venture for million  which included loan assumptions of million and net proceeds of million 
as of march   we contributed the final four properties to the joint venture with hines reit retail holdings  llc with an aggregate value of approximately million  and aggregating approximately million square feet 
these four shopping centers are located one each in florida and north carolina and two in georgia  and we received net proceeds of approximately million 
these contributions included loan assumptions on each of the properties  which transferred secured debt totaling approximately million to the consolidated joint venture 
we have a real estate limited partnership with a foreign institutional investor to purchase up to million of retail properties in various states 
our ownership in this unconsolidated real estate limited partnership is 
as of december   no properties had been purchased 
while we are not currently pursuing new joint ventures utilizing our current asset pool  we continue to monitor our joint venture relationships and evaluate whether new relationships could provide equity for new investments 
although we have no current plans  it is uncertain whether we will be successful in completing any additional transactions in the near future 
joint venture fee income for the year ended december  was approximately million or a decrease from the prior year of 
million 
this fee income is based upon revenues  net income and in some cases appraised property values 
due to decreases in these factors at our unconsolidated joint ventures  joint venture fee income has declined 
we anticipate these fees may marginally improve in over our current performance 
dispositions during  we sold retail properties  five industrial properties and retail buildings at seven operating properties  for million 
although the availability of debt financing for prospective acquirers has been limited in the current capital markets  we expect to continue to dispose of selected non core properties throughout as opportunities present themselves 
dispositions are a key component of our liquidity strategy  and are also part of our ongoing management process where we prune from our portfolio  properties that do not meet our geographic or growth targets 
dispositions provide capital  which may be recycled into properties that have high barrier to entry locations within high growth metropolitan markets 
over time  we expect this to produce a portfolio with higher occupancy rates and stronger internal revenue growth 
summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which begins the date the leasehold improvements are substantially complete  if owned by us  or the date the tenant takes control of the space  if the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant 
revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes  maintenance expenses and insurance is subject to our interpretation of lease provisions and is recognized in the period the related expense is recognized 
revenue based on a percentage of tenants sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint 
in addition  in circumstances where we would provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we would recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
other revenue is income from contractual agreements with third parties  tenants or partially owned real estate joint ventures or partnerships  which is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
real estate joint ventures and partnerships to determine the method of accounting for partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships  we apply the guidelines as set forth in gaap 
entities identified as variable interest entities are consolidated if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the partially owned real estate joint venture or partnership 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships over which we exercise financial and operating control are consolidated in our financial statements 
in determining if we exercise financial and operating control  we consider factors such as ownership interest  authority to make decisions  kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
if there are changes in these factors  these reconsideration events are assessed to determine if the consolidation treatment remains appropriate 
management analyzes and assesses reconsideration events as soon as they become aware of them 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships where we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but do not exercise financial and operating control  are accounted for using the equity method 
decisions regarding consolidation of partially owned entities frequently require significant judgment by our management 
errors in the assessment of consolidation could result in material changes to our consolidated financial statements 
property real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and years for parking lot surfacing and equipment 
major replacements where the betterment extends the useful life of the asset are capitalized  and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
all other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the acquisition method and  accordingly  the results of operations of an acquired property are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
estimates of fair values are based upon future cash flows and other valuation techniques in accordance with our fair value measurements policy  which are used to record the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  tenant improvements  other identifiable intangibles and any goodwill or gain on purchase 
other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities include the effect of out of market leases  the value of having leases in place as is versus as if vacant and absorption costs  out of market assumed mortgages and tenant relationships 
depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and over the lease term which includes bargain renewal options for other identifiable intangible assets 
the impact of these estimates  including incorrect estimates in connection with acquisition values and estimated useful lives  could result in significant differences related to the purchased assets  liabilities and resulting depreciation or amortization 
effective  acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
property also includes costs incurred in the development of new operating properties and properties in our merchant development program 
merchant development is a program in which we develop a project with the objective of selling all or part of it  instead of retaining it in our portfolio on a long term basis 
also  disposition of land parcels and non operating properties are included in this program 
these properties are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets until the commencement of rental revenue or no later than one year from the completion of major construction 
these costs include pre acquisition costs directly identifiable with the specific project  development and construction costs  interest and real estate taxes 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits  travel and other related costs that are directly attributable to the development of the property  are also capitalized 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the completion of major construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
the impact of the estimates related to the allocation of indirect costs and interest could result in incorrect estimates in connection with determining the asset value which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
property also includes costs for tenant improvements paid by us  including reimbursements to tenants for improvements that are owned by us and will remain our property after the lease expires 
impairment our properties are reviewed for impairment  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property  including any identifiable intangible assets including site costs and capitalized interest  may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs for our properties  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
our carrying amounts are adjusted  if necessary  to the estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset 
fair values are determined by management utilizing cash flow models and market discount rates  or by obtaining third party broker or appraisal estimates in accordance with our fair value measurements policy 
our analysis of current economic considerations at each reporting period  including the effects of tenant bankruptcies  lack of credit available to retailers  the suspension of tenant expansion plans for new development projects  declines in real estate values and management s plans related to our new development properties including land held for development could result in an impairment charge 
determining whether a property is impaired and  if impaired  the amount of required write down to fair value requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation 
the evaluations used in these analyses could result in incorrect estimates when determining carrying values that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our investments in partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships are reviewed for impairment  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation 
our overall future plans for the investment  our investment partner s financial outlook and our views on current market and economic conditions may have a significant impact on the resulting factors analyzed for these purposes 
interest capitalization interest is capitalized on land under development and buildings under construction based on rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period and the weighted average balance of qualified assets under development construction during the period 
differences in methodologies to calculate applicable interest rates and the cost of qualified assets can yield significant differences in the amounts capitalized and  as a result  the amount of depreciation recognized 
fair value measurements certain financial instruments  estimates and transactions are required to be calculated  reported and or recorded at fair value 
the estimated fair values of such financial items  including debt instruments  impairments  acquisitions  investment securities and derivatives  have been determined using a market based measurement 
this measurement is determined based on the assumptions that management believes market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which is typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
the assessed inputs used in determining any fair value measurements could result in incorrect valuations that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred charges debt financing costs are amortized primarily on a straight line basis  which approximates the effective interest method  over the terms of the debt 
lease costs represent the initial direct costs incurred in origination  negotiation and processing of a lease agreement 
such costs include outside broker commissions and other independent third party costs  as well as salaries and benefits  travel and other internal costs directly related to completing a lease and are amortized over the life of the lease on a straight line basis 
costs related to supervision  administration  unsuccessful origination efforts and other activities not directly related to completed lease agreements are charged to expense as incurred 
differences in methodologies to calculate and defer these costs can yield differences in the amounts deferred and  accordingly  the amount of amortization recognized 
sales of real estate sales of real estate include the sale of shopping center pads  property adjacent to shopping centers  shopping center properties  merchant development properties  investments in real estate joint ventures and partnerships and partial sales to real estate joint ventures and partnerships in which we participate 
profits on sales of real estate  including merchant development sales are not recognized until a a sale is consummated  b the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay  c the seller s receivable is not subject to future subordination  and d we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership in the transaction  and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation 
we recognize gains on the sale of real estate to joint ventures and partnerships in which we participate to the extent we receive cash from the joint venture or partnership  if it meets the sales criteria in accordance with gaap  and we do not have a commitment to support the operations of the real estate joint venture or partnership to an extent greater than our proportionate interest in the real estate joint venture or partnership 
accrued rent and accounts receivable receivable balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to the straight lining of rental commitments 
an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical bad debt levels  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends 
additionally  estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy are considered in assessing the collectibility of the related receivables 
as these factors change  the allowance is subject to revision and may impact our results of operations 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute to our shareholders 
to be taxed as a reit  we must meet a number of requirements including defined percentage tests concerning the amount of our assets and revenues that come from  or are attributable to  real estate operations 
as long as we distribute at least of the taxable income of the reit without regard to capital gains or the dividends paid deduction to our shareholders as dividends  we will not be taxed on the portion of our income we distribute as dividends 
the tax relief extension act of gave reits the ability to conduct activities which a reit was previously precluded from doing as long as such activities are performed in entities which have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries under the irs code 
these activities include buying or developing properties with the express purpose of selling them 
we conduct certain of these activities in taxable reit subsidiaries that we have created 
we calculate and record income taxes in our consolidated financial statements based on the activities in those entities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between our carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
these are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established for those assets we do not consider the realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
we use estimates in preparing our deferred tax amounts and if revised  these estimates could impact our results of operations 
additionally  gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return 
a tax position may only be recognized in the financial statements if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues total revenues were million for the year ended versus million for the year ended  a decrease of million or 
this decrease resulted from a decrease in net rental revenues of million  which is offset by an increase in other income of million 
this decrease in net rental revenues resulted primarily from a decline in occupancy  the million decrease associated with the deconsolidation of four joint ventures as of december   and a reduction of million from the sale of an interest in four shopping centers in october the increase in other income resulted primarily from an increase in lease cancellation income from various tenants

gain on merchant development sales gain on merchant development sales of million in resulted primarily from the gain on sale of a land parcel  the sale of an unconsolidated joint venture interest in a shopping center in colorado and the sale of an industrial building 
the gain on merchant development sales of million in resulted primarily from the sale of land parcels plus the realization of a land parcel deferred gain totaling million 
provision benefit for income taxes the increase in the tax provision of million is attributable primarily to our taxable reit subsidiary 
the benefit in associated with impairment losses and the write off of pre development costs was greater compared to the activities in also  in we recorded a valuation allowance of million associated with impairment losses and established a million deferred liability associated with book tax basis differentials 
the valuation allowance was established as the realization of these losses is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the years the related properties are sold 
gain on sale of property the increase in gain on sale of property of million is attributable primarily to the sale of an interest in four shopping centers in october and the disposition of retail buildings at seven operating properties during results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues total revenues were million for the year ended versus million for the year ended  an increase of million or

provision benefit for income taxes the decrease of million resulted primarily from the decrease in income at our taxable reit subsidiary associated with a reduction in merchant development gains  write off of pre development costs and impairment charges 
effects of inflation we have structured our leases in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby we receive increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than years  which allow us to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of our leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results as they are absorbed by our tenants 
under the current economic climate  little to no inflation is occurring 
capital resources and liquidity our primary liquidity needs are paying our common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  paying our debt service costs  excluding debt maturities  and funding capital expenditures 
we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities primarily in the form of rental revenues will provide all our capital needs including common and preferred dividends  debt service costs  excluding debt maturities  and the capital necessary to maintain and operate our existing properties 
while our occupancy is projected to remain around the level during  the operating cash flow generated at that occupancy should remain adequate to provide capital for these liquidity needs 
the primary sources of capital for funding any debt maturities and acquisitions are our revolving credit facility  proceeds from both secured and unsecured debt issuances  proceeds from common and preferred capital issuances  cash generated from the sale of property and the formation of joint ventures  and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  common and preferred equity  cash generated from disposition of properties and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
in february  we renegotiated a new million revolving credit facility  of which we have no outstanding amounts as of february  the credit market turmoil affected our ability to obtain additional capital earlier in the year  however  we have been able to raise billion of new capital thereby significantly improving our overall liquidity 
as described under investing activities and financing activities below  in we completed an offering for million common shares with net proceeds totaling million  concurrent with the offering  we reduced our quarterly dividend rate per share from 
to 
which commenced with the second quarter distribution  contributions of property to two joint ventures that provided million in cash  dispositions including merchant development sales of million  secured and unsecured loans totaling million and million  respectively and a cash distribution of secured debt proceeds from an unconsolidated joint venture totaling million 
if investment opportunities present themselves  we may consider adding some additional debt as long as we maintain acceptable overall levels of leverage 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain debt on terms acceptable to us 
we presently have million of dispositions under contract or under letters of intent 
there can be no assurance that these transactions can be completed as planned 
we have repositioned our future debt maturities to manageable levels 
during the second quarter of  we repurchased million principal amount of our convertible senior unsecured notes 
in addition  we issued a tender offer for up to million aggregate principal amount of a series of unsecured notes and our convertible senior unsecured notes 
as a result of the tender offer  we repurchased million principal amount of our unsecured notes and million principal amount of our convertible senior unsecured notes 
these transactions were primarily funded with excess cash from our april common equity issuance and our million revolving credit facility 
in february  we replaced our million revolving credit facility with a million three year facility 
we elected to reduce the amount of the facility based on current and projected future cash needs 
our most restrictive debt covenants including debt to assets  secured debt to assets  fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage and debt yield ratios  limit the amount of additional leverage we can add  however  we believe the sources of capital described above are adequate to execute our current business plan and remain in compliance with our debt covenants

upon the conversion of debentures  we will deliver cash for the principal return  as defined  and cash or common shares  at our option  for the excess of the conversion value  as defined  over the principal return 
the debentures are redeemable for cash at our option beginning in for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures for cash equal to the principal of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest in  and and in the event of a change in control

we have entered into several unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
under many of these agreements  we and our joint venture partners are required to fund operating capital upon shortfalls in working capital 
we have also committed to fund the capital requirements of several new development joint ventures 
as operating manager of most of these entities  we have considered these funding requirements in our business plan 
reconsideration events could cause us to consolidate these joint ventures and partnerships 
we evaluate reconsideration events as we become aware of them 
some triggers to be considered are additional contributions required by each partner and each partners ability to make those contributions 
under certain of these circumstances  we may purchase our partner s interest 
our material unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are with entities which appear sufficiently stable to weather the current market crisis  however  if market conditions were to continue to deteriorate and our partners are unable to meet their commitments  there is a possibility we may have to consolidate these entities 
if we were to consolidate all of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures  we would still be in compliance with our debt covenants  and we believe there would not be a material change in our credit ratings 
related to our investment in a redevelopment project in sheridan  colorado that is held in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture  we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have each provided a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on bonds issued in connection with the project 
the sheridan redevelopment agency agency issued million of series a bonds used for an urban renewal project 
the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee pif to be assessed on current and future retail sales  and  to the extent necessary  any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty 
the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the earlier of the bond liability has been paid in full or unless such date is otherwise extended by the agency 
at inception on february   we evaluated and determined that the fair value of the guaranty was nominal to us as the guarantor 
however  a liability was recorded by the joint venture equal to net amounts funded under the bonds 
in connection with the above project  we and our joint venture partner were also signatories to a completion guaranty that required  among other things  certain infrastructure to be substantially completed and occupants of of the retail space to be open for regular business as of december  under specified circumstances  the completion guaranty allowed for extension of the completion date until june  at inception on february   we evaluated the guaranty and determined that its then fair value was nominal 
by a letter dated december   the guarantors requested extension of the completion date pursuant to the terms of the guaranty 
on december   one of the parties benefited by the guaranty filed a lawsuit against us alleging that we were not entitled to the extension and was seeking million in liquidated damages together with other relief 
in july  we settled the lawsuit 
among the obligations performed or to be performed by us under the terms of the settlement are to cause the joint venture to purchase a portion of the bonds in the amount of million at par plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such purchase  and to the extent that the outstanding letter of credit supporting additional bonds totaling million with a current term of months is not replaced by an alternate letter of credit issued by another qualified provider on or before july   we will be obligated to provide up to of the outstanding stated amount of the letter of credit as additional collateral in the form of either cash or a back to back letter of credit 
on july   as part of the settlement agreement  among other things  the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice  we loaned million including accrued interest and fees to the joint venture which then purchased the bonds  and the completion guaranty was terminated 
also in connection with the sheridan  colorado joint venture and the issuance of the related series a bonds  we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have also provided a performance guaranty on behalf of the sheridan redevelopment agency for the satisfaction of all obligations arising from two interest rate swap agreements for the combined notional amount of million that matures in december we evaluated and determined that the fair value of the guaranty both at inception and december  was nominal 
we have evaluated the remaining outstanding guaranties and have determined that the fair value of these guaranties is nominal 
in december  an unconsolidated joint venture became a variable interest entity through the issuance of a secured loan since the lender has the ability to make decisions that could have a significant impact on the success of the entity 
the unconsolidated joint venture s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the venture s outstanding debt  which is approximately million at december  in july  a owned unconsolidated real estate joint venture acquired an interest in a joint venture owning a  square foot new development property to be constructed in aurora  colorado 
the acquired joint venture is a variable interest entity to the unconsolidated joint venture since it provided a guaranty on debt obtained by the acquired joint venture  which was approximately million at december  we have evaluated and determined that the fair value of the guaranty both at inception and december  was nominal 
in august  we executed a real estate limited partnership with a foreign institutional investor to purchase up to million of retail properties in various states 
our ownership in this unconsolidated real estate limited partnership is 
as of december   no properties had been purchased 
funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties  including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
ffo is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net income attributable to common shareholders depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships gain on sale of property gain on sale of property of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships funds from operations funds from operations attributable to operating partnership units funds from operations assuming conversion of operating partnership units weighted average shares outstanding basic effect of dilutive securities share options and awards operating partnership units weighted average shares outstanding diluted newly issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu  improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
asu updated asc  consolidations and was intended to improve an organization s variable interest entity reporting 
it will require a change in the analysis used to determine whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the analysis will be used to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the holder of the variable interest will be defined as the primary beneficiary if it has both the power to influence the entity s significant economic activities and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or receive potentially significant benefits 
asu also requires additional disclosures about an entity s variable interest entities 
the update is effective for us on january  we expect the adoption of this update to the codification will not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu provides for new disclosures as well as  clarification of existing disclosures on fair value measurements including employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
the update is effective for us beginning january   and we do not expect the adoption of asu to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance our capital requirements 
these transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points and holding all other variables constant  annual net income and cash flows for the following year would decrease by approximately million associated with our variable rate debt  including the effect of the interest rate swaps 
the effect of the basis points increase would decrease the fair value of our variable rate and fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively
