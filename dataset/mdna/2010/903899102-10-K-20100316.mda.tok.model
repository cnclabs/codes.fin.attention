currently  we do not experience significant seasonal sales trends in any of our operating segments  although sales to the us defense department and other international defense organizations can be sporadic based on the needs of those particular customers 
overview for the year ended december   revenue totaled  compared to  for we incurred an operating loss of  for compared to operating income of  for net loss attributable to ultralife for was  compared to net income attributable to ultralife of  for the prior year 
the decrease in sales in versus was due to the fulfillment of some large satcom on the move orders that did not reoccur as we had expected in we did not receive the expected large order in for our satcom on the move system under the mrap all terrain vehicle program  because the prime contractor through whom our system is sold did not have a contract in place with the us government in time to meet the us defense department s delivery schedule 
therefore  the order was awarded to another company 
the reduction in sales was partially offset by higher shipments of our ba batteries to government defense contractors and stronger demand for batteries and charging systems from us defense customers versus  as well as the acquisition of amti in march the reduction in operating profit in was attributable to the sales decrease as noted above and an increase in operating expenses from  in to  in the increase in spending was attributable to higher research and development costs due to greater investments in product design and development activity and higher selling and administrative costs resulting from costs related to our recently acquired companies and generally higher administrative expenses 
our net loss for was also impacted by higher interest expense due to higher average levels of borrowings and the impact of a weaker us dollar on our foreign currency transactions 
we reported revenue of  for the fourth quarter of and an operating profit of  quarter over quarter  revenue was up from the third quarter revenue of  the operating profit in the fourth quarter of was a result of continued growth in gross margin and decreased operating costs as a result of the initiatives that we started earlier in it was hampered by a provision connected with inventory of our older amplifier products that are now considered to be slow moving because of the strong market reception for our new amplifier line  added following our amti acquisition 
fourth quarter of revenue growth was led by strong battery sales in both defense and commercial markets and by the initiation of shipments on the communications systems orders that we announced in mid october 
fourth quarter of gross margin improved as a result of a favorable mix of engineered products and strong operating performance in both our us and china battery production facilities 
the amplifier products that we acquired when we purchased amti are now an important part of our offerings both as components and as part of our advanced communications systems 
although we have only owned that operation for the last three quarters of  sales levels for the year were more than three times the sales level of the previous year and we expect to further expand this business in we expect that the further integration of the amti products  processes and resources into our communication systems business will offer additional enhancements to our product portfolio and operating efficiencies 
as reflected in our fourth quarter operating performance  we completed cost reduction and consolidation actions in the latter half of to help offset the increased expenses resulting from our acquisitions of use in november and amti in march and to improve our operational efficiencies 
in  we substantially completed the consolidation of our standby power acquisitions to operate as one national business 
our actions included the appointment of a single management team responsible for all business operations  the consolidation of backroom functions and the implementation of our corporate information technology systems 
during  our amti acquisition benefitted from the synergies of our global sales force and our communications products utilizing amti products and engineering expertise 
we expect further synergies to result in 
table of contents in addition  we significantly improved our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of as reflected in the reduction in both our accounts receivables and inventories over the second and third quarters of we believe that our entering into a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility in february with rbs business capital further strengthens our financial position for the future 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  we commenced shipments of lithium ion batteries to the uk ministry of defence under a contract with general dynamics uk 
we believe this new line of products has the potential to be a strong contributor to revenue growth in in the first half of  we also expect to be shipping initial units of the new version of our tactical repeater for handheld radios 
by incorporating one of amti s new compact amplifier products  the new version increases the power and range of our existing products by we also expect to be starting trials on a new lithium ion backup product 
based on scalable kw modules  we believe it is able to be managed and monitored remotely and operates over a wide temperature range for approximately times the lifetime of traditional lead acid products 
it is expected that utilization of these capabilities will enable reductions in total cost of ownership by in the applications that we have targeted 
during the second quarter of  we also expect to have fully qualified the new version of our volt product 
designed and manufactured in our china facility  it has improved performance over our current product and by the end of we expect to be producing half of our volt demand in china and ultimately producing of our volt product there 
our china operation continues to see revenue growth in our line of lithium thionyl chloride products 
much of the growth has been from the growing market for automated meter reading in china  a key focus of their economic stimulus program 
we expect to see this market growing in  and we also expect to see opportunities for growth for our thionyl chloride products in europe and the us we believe that new offerings and geographic expansion are our keys to revenue growth in and beyond 
in our battery products  we expect that our major initiative will be in deploying larger scale lithium ion products for energy storage 
we anticipate that our energy services segment will complement this by providing a channel through which to deliver complete solutions based on a total cost of ownership model 
in communications systems we expect to see further expansion of satcom systems in mobile communications 
we also expect to expand this market internationally as us allies see the importance of extended communications capability beyond line of sight 
and we expect our pocket amplifiers and tactical repeaters to bring portable and instantly deployable range extension to the fast expanding world of handheld radios 
one of the issues that we have faced in growing our company has been the variability of orders 
the markets that we serve  government defense  commercial and standby power  all have elements that contribute to fluctuating revenues in reporting periods 
diversifying our business and increasing our service component helps  but will not eliminate this variability 
we also recognize the ongoing potential impact of competition within the industries we serve 
we believe that we have or will be making the necessary investments to best position our product and service offerings to meet or exceed that of our competitors 
this however  in itself  may not guarantee that our products and services will be selected to fulfill the orders and or contracts we pursue  as other factors such as competitive pricing below our gross margin requirements or small business preferences may prevail 
over the past year  dealing with this effect  together with the general economic slowdown  has caused us to change our approach to budgeting and planning for we have consolidated operations and focused our business planning and management around the models of three operating segments for we have reduced our overhead to match the revenue level of our sustainable base while retaining the controls required of a public corporation and sustaining important investments 
and we have sharpened our disciplines to ensure that as we generate higher returns on the investments we are making in operations  products and markets  the greatest amount possible flows to profitability

the decrease in non rechargeable revenues was mainly attributable to a decline in sales to automotive telematics customers due to the recession  offset in part by higher shipments of our ba batteries to government defense customers 
rechargeable product revenues increased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the increase in rechargeable revenues was mainly attributable to strong demand for batteries and charging systems from us defense customers 
communications systems revenues decreased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the decrease in communications systems revenues was mainly attributable to large deliveries of satcom on the move and other advanced communications systems in  which did not reoccur in this decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of amti in march design and installation services revenues increased  or  from  last year to  this year 
the increase in design and installation services revenues was mainly attributable to the added revenue base provided from the acquisition of use in november cost of products sold 
cost of products sold decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues 
consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue increased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the year ended december  correspondingly  consolidated gross margins was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december   generally attributable to the margin decrease in the design and installation services segment  offset by improvements in the non rechargeable products  rechargeable products and communications systems segments

in our communications systems segment  the cost of products sold decreased  from  in to  in communications systems gross margin for was  or  a decrease of  from s gross margin of  or 
the increase in the gross margin percentage for communications systems resulted from the recognition of a gain on litigation settlement totaling  in relation to the settlement of an ongoing litigation with a vendor  which was partially offset by the overall sales mix and lower sales volume in this segment 
we also implemented a four day work week for production personnel in our newark operations  which included a significant portion of our communications systems manufacturing operations  in the third quarter of  to align production levels with current sales levels 
for the fourth quarter of  we resumed a full five day work week for production personnel in our newark operations in response to increased production demand 
in our design and installation services segment  the cost of sales increased  from  for the year ended december   to  in design and installation services gross margin for was  or  compared to s gross margin of  or 
gross margin in this particular segment was weaker than expected due to continued intense price competition with component suppliers  relatively low margin jobs that carried over from into  and ongoing integration efforts related to the use acquisition 
the intense price competition with component suppliers is expected to continue into  which we expect to mitigate with greater emphasis on higher margin services  including wireless cell tower projects 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from reported the prior year  due to the overall expense increase over a lower revenue base 
in response to this unfavorable change to the percentage of sales  we have consolidated some of our operations to lower the fixed costs basis of our operations  performed an overall cost reduction analysis and tightened our cost controls  along with deferring some of our discretionary spending 
amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions was  for  in selling  general and administrative expenses and in research and development costs  compared with  for  in selling  general  and administrative expenses and in research and development costs 
research and development costs were  in  an increase of  or  over the  reported in  as we increased our investment on product development and design activity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased  or  to  this increase was comprised of costs related to recently acquired companies  in addition to higher sales and marketing expenses related to development of new territories for the standby power business and generally higher administrative costs 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled  for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  interest expense  net of interest income  increased  from for to  for  mainly as a result of higher average borrowings under our revolving credit facility

we reflected a tax provision of for the twelve month period ended december  compared with  in the same period of the tax provision included an approximate  non cash charge to record a deferred tax liability for liabilities generated from goodwill and certain intangible assets that cannot be predicted to reverse for book purposes during our loss carryforward periods 
substantially all of this adjustment related to book tax differences that occurred during and were identified during the second quarter of in connection with this adjustment  we reviewed the illustrative list of qualitative considerations provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no

we have determined that a change in ownership  as defined under internal revenue code section  occurred in and as such  the domestic nol carryforward will be subject to an annual limitation estimated to be in the range of approximately  to  the unused portion of the annual limitation can be carried forward to subsequent periods 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards due to the successive ownership changes is currently limited to a minimum of approximately  annually  plus the carryover from unused portions of the annual limitations 
we believe such limitation will not impact our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain of our nol carryforwards are subject to us alternative minimum tax such that carryforwards can offset only of alternative minimum taxable income 
this limitation did not have an impact on income taxes determined for however  this limitation did have an impact of on income taxes determined for the use of our uk nol carryforwards may be limited due to the change in the uk operation during from a manufacturing and assembly center to primarily a distribution and service center

adjusted ebitda in evaluating our business  we consider and use adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our operating performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before net interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  plus minus expenses income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance and to enhance comparability between periods 
we also believe the use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in such items as capital structures affecting relative interest expense and stock based compensation expense  the book amortization of intangible assets affecting relative amortization expense  the age and book value of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense and other significant non cash  non operating expenses or income 
we also present adjusted ebitda because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance 
we reconcile adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to ultralife  the most comparable financial measure under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 

table of contents we use adjusted ebitda in our decision making processes relating to the operation of our business together with us gaap financial measures such as income loss from operations 
we believe that adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our us gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and of non cash stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among companies 
we provide information relating to our adjusted ebitda so that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of our operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flows to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
the term adjusted ebitda is not defined under us gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap 
our adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income loss attributable to ultralife or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with us gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to  the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  does not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  and does not reflect all of the costs associated with operating our business  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  while stock based compensation is a component of cost of products sold and operating expenses  the impact on our consolidated financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as assumed life of the stock based awards and assumed volatility of our common stock  and other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
adjusted ebitda is calculated as follows for the periods presented years ended december  net income loss attributable to ultralife add interest expense  net add income tax provision add depreciation expense add amortization expense add stock based compensation expense less gain on mcdowell settlement less gain on debt conversion adjusted ebitda 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows and general business matters as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  from the beginning of the year 
during the twelve months ended december   we generated  of cash from operating activities as compared to generating  of cash for the twelve months ended december  the cash from operating activities used during was mainly attributable to our pre tax loss of  plus an addback of  for non cash expenses including depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and a gain on litigation settlement of  approximately  of cash was generated for working capital due mainly to a decrease in inventories  offset by increases in accounts receivable due to timing of orders and a decrease in accounts payable 
for  the cash generated from operating activities of  was mainly attributable to a pre tax income of  plus an addback of  for non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
approximately  of cash was used for working capital due mainly to increases in accounts receivable and inventories  offset by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in prepaid expenses 
we used  in cash for investing activities during compared with  in cash used for investing activities in in  we spent  to purchase plant  property and equipment  and  was used in connection with the acquisition of amti  as well as contingent purchase price payouts related to redblack and rps 
in  we spent  to purchase plant  property and equipment  and  of which was used in connection with the acquisition of use  as well as a contingent purchase price payout related to the able acquisition 
during  we generated  in funds from financing activities compared to the usage of  in funds in the financing activities in included a  inflow from drawdowns on the revolver portion of our primary credit facility  an inflow of for proceeds from the issuance of debt  and an inflow of cash from stock option and warrant exercises of  offset by an outflow of  for principal payments on term debt under our primary credit facility and capital lease obligations  and an outflow of  for the purchase of treasury shares related to our share repurchase program 
the financing activities in included outflows of  for revolver loan repayments   for principal payments on our term loan  capital leases  and debt we assumed from acquisitions  and purchase of treasury shares of  offset by inflows of  from stock option and warrant exercises 
although we booked a full reserve for our deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter of and continued to carry this reserve as of december  and  we continue to have significant us nol s available to us to utilize as an offset to taxable income 
as of december   none of our us nol s have expired 
during  we utilized  of our us nol carryforwards such that over the next five years  there are no scheduled expirations of our us nol s 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inventory turnover for the year ended december  averaged turns compared to turns for the decrease in this metric is mainly due to a buildup in inventory in anticipation of certain orders from the us government that were delayed and ultimately awarded to another contractor  as well as the decrease in the sales volumes during our days sales outstanding dsos was an average of days for  an increase from the average of days  mainly due to the overall domestic and global recessionary economic conditions 
our order backlog at december  was approximately  the majority of the backlog was related to orders that are expected to ship throughout as of december   we had made commitments to purchase approximately of production machinery and equipment  which we expect to fund through operating cash flows or the use of debt 
potential commitments we have had certain exigent non bid contracts with the us government  which have been subject to an audit and final price adjustment  which have resulted in decreased margins compared with the original terms of the contracts 
as of december   there were no outstanding exigent contracts with the government 
as part of its due diligence  the government has conducted post audits of the completed exigent contracts to ensure that information used in supporting the pricing of exigent contracts did not differ materially from actual results 
in september  the defense contracting audit agency dcaa presented its findings related to the audits of three of the exigent contracts  suggesting a potential pricing adjustment of approximately  related to reductions in the cost of materials that occurred prior to the final negotiation of these contracts 
we have reviewed these audit reports  have submitted our response to these audits and believe  taken as a whole  
table of contents the proposed audit adjustments can be offset with the consideration of other compensating cost increases that occurred prior to the final negotiation of the contracts 
while we believe that potential exposure exists relating to any final negotiation of these proposed adjustments  we cannot reasonably estimate what  if any  adjustment may result when finalized 
in addition  in june  we received a request from the office of inspector general of the department of defense dod ig seeking certain information and documents relating to our business with the department of defense 
we continue to cooperate with the dcaa audit and dod ig inquiry by making available to government auditors and investigators our personnel and furnishing the requested information and documents 
at this time we have no basis for assessing whether we might face any penalties or liabilities on account of the dod ig inquiry 
the aforementioned dcaa related adjustments could reduce margins and  along with the aforementioned dod ig inquiry  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
from august through august  we participated in a self insured trust to manage our workers compensation activity for our employees in new york state 
all members of this trust have  by design  joint and several liability during the time they participate in the trust 
in august  we left the self insured trust and have obtained alternative coverage for our workers compensation program through a third party insurer 
in the third quarter of  we confirmed that the trust was in an underfunded position ie the assets of the trust were insufficient to cover the actuarially projected liabilities associated with the members in the trust 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a liability and an associated expense of as an estimate of our potential future cost related to the trust s underfunded status based on our estimated level of participation 
on april   we  along with all other members of the trust  were served by the state of new york workers compensation board compensation board with a summons with notice that was filed in albany county supreme court  wherein the compensation board put all members of the trust on notice that it would be seeking approximately  in previously billed and unpaid assessments and further assessments estimated to be not less than  arising from the accumulated estimated under funding of the trust 
the summons with notice did not contain a complaint or a specified demand 
we timely filed a notice of appearance in response to the summons with notice 
on june   we were served with a verified complaint 
subject to the results of a deficit reconstruction that was pending  the verified complaint estimated that the trust was underfunded by  during the period of december  november  and an additional  for the period december  august  the verified complaint estimated our pro rata share of the liability for the period of december  november  to be the verified complaint did not contain a pro rata share liability estimate for the period of december  august  further  the verified complaint stated that all estimates of the underfunded status of the trust and the pro rata share liability for the period of december  november  were subject to adjustment based on a forensic audit of the trust that was being conducted on behalf of the compensation board by a third party audit firm 
we timely filed our verified answer with affirmative defenses on july  in november  the new york attorney general s office presented the results of the deficit reconstruction of the trust 
as a result of the deficit reconstruction  the state of new york has determined that the trust was underfunded by  instead of  our pro rata share of the liability was determined to be the attorney general s office has proposed a settlement by which we may avoid joint and several liability in exchange for settlement payment of under the terms of the settlement agreement  we can satisfy our obligations by either paying i a lump sum of  representing a discount  ii paying the entire amount in twelve monthly installments of commencing the month following execution of the settlement agreement  or iii paying the entire amount in monthly installments over a period of up to five years  with interest of    and for the two  three  four and five year periods  respectively 
the proposed settlement is potentially contingent on the compensation board receiving sufficient commitments from the defendants of the desired settlement amount of  as of december   we have adjusted our reserve to to account for the twelve monthly installments settlement amount 
in connection with our acquisition of stationary power on november   the purchase agreement specified an adjustment mechanism based upon stationary power s closing date net worth balance relative to a previously agreed amount of the final net value of the net worth  under the stock purchase agreement  was  resulting in a revised initial purchase price of  in addition  there is a contingent payout of up to  shares of our common stock to be earned upon the achievement of certain post acquisition sales milestones

correspondingly  the interest rate swap arrangement we entered into in connection with the term loan under our credit facility expired and we had no further obligations under the interest rate swap arrangement 
on january   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the restated credit agreement with the lenders 
the restated credit agreement reflected the previous ten amendments to the original credit agreement dated june  between us and the lenders and modifies certain of those provisions 
the restated credit agreement among other things i increased the current revolver loan commitment from  to  ii extended the maturity date of the revolving credit component from january  to june   iii modified the interest rate  and iv modified certain covenants 
the rate of interest was based  in general  upon either a libor rate plus a eurodollar spread or an alternate base rate plus an abr spread  as that term was defined in the restated credit agreement  within a predetermined grid  which was dependent upon whether earnings before interest and taxes for the most recently completed fiscal quarter was greater than or less than zero 
generally  borrowings under the restated credit agreement bear interest based primarily on the prime rate plus to basis points or libor plus to basis points 
additionally  among other covenant modifications  the restated credit agreement modified the financial covenants by i revising the debt to earnings ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio and ii deleting the current assets to liabilities ratio 
effective june   we entered into waiver and amendment number one to amended and restated credit agreement waiver and amendment with the lenders and agent 
the waiver and amendment provided that the lenders and agent would waive their right to exercise their respective rights and remedies under the credit facility arising from our failure to comply with the financial covenants in the credit facility with respect to the fiscal quarter ended june  in addition to a number of revisions to non financial covenants  the waiver and amendment revised the applicable revolver rate under the restated credit agreement to an interest rate structure based on the prime rate plus basis points or libor plus basis points 
as stated in the restated credit agreement  as amended by the waiver and amendment  we were required to maintain a debt to earnings ratio at or below to and a fixed charge ratio at or above to as of december   our debt to earnings ratio was to and our fixed charge ratio was to accordingly  we were not in compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 
this constituted an event of default under the terms of our existing credit facility which entitled our lenders to provide us with notice that they were exercising their rights under the credit facility 

table of contents on january   we received a demand letter from the agent in connection with the restated credit agreement demand letter 
in the demand letter  the agent claimed that we had i failed to satisfy and comply with the financial covenants set forth in section of the restated credit agreement  and ii failed to pay interest and expenses when due as set forth in section b of the restated credit agreement

the agent demanded payment of such amount by january  the agent also terminated the lender s commitment to lend additional funds to us under the restated credit agreement and increased the interest rate on the outstanding principal to the default rate set under section c of the restated credit agreement 
on january   we entered into a forbearance and amendment number two to the restated credit agreement with the lenders forbearance agreement 
under the forbearance agreement  the lenders agreed to forbear until february  from exercising their respective rights and remedies under the restated credit agreement and delayed the date by which we were to pay the lenders the amount declared due and payable under the demand letter 
under the forbearance agreement  we were required to make payments on the outstanding principal owed under the restated credit agreement pursuant to the following schedule i  on january   ii  on or before january   and iii commencing february  and continuing on each friday through the term of the forbearance agreement 
we were also required to pay a forbearance fee of and all of the fees and expenses incurred by the lenders 
the forbearance agreement also reaffirmed the lenders termination of their commitment to lend additional funds to us under the restated credit agreement and the increased interest rate on the outstanding principal to the default rate set under section c of the restated credit agreement

equity transactions in november  we completed a limited public offering  whereby  shares of our common stock were issued 
total net proceeds from the offering were approximately  of which  was used for the stationary power acquisition cash payment   was used as a prepayment on the subordinated convertible notes that were issued as partial consideration for the mcdowell acquisition  and  was used as a repayment of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility used to fund the redblack acquisition 
the remainder of the proceeds was used for general working capital purposes 
in october  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to  to be implemented over the course of a six month period 
repurchases were made from time to time at management s discretion  either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchases were made in compliance with securities and exchange commission guidelines and were subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
we have no obligation under the program to repurchase shares and the program could have been suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
we funded the purchase price for shares acquired primarily with current cash on hand and cash generated from operations  in addition to borrowing from our credit facility  as necessary 
we spent  to repurchase  shares of common stock  at an average price of approximately per share  under this share repurchase program 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of approximately per share  under this share repurchase program  all other share repurchases were made in the fourth quarter of in april  this share repurchase program expired 
in some of our recent acquisitions  we utilized securities as consideration in these transactions in part to reduce the need to draw on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents and revolving credit facility 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other matters we continually explore various sources of liquidity to ensure financing flexibility  including leasing alternatives  issuing new or refinancing existing debt  and raising equity through private or public offerings 
although we stay abreast of such financing alternatives  we believe we have the ability during the next months to finance our operations primarily through internally generated funds or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to us 
in the event that we are unable to finance our operations with the internally generated funds or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to us  we may need to seek additional credit or access capital markets for additional funds 
we can provide no assurance  given the current state of credit markets  that we would be successful in this regard  especially in light of our recent operating performance 
if we are unable to achieve our plans or unforeseen events occur  we may need to implement alternative plans in addition to plans that we have already initiated 
while we believe we can complete our original plans or alternative plans  if necessary  there can be no assurance that such alternatives would be available on acceptable terms and conditions or that we would be successful in our implementation of such plans 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings of this report  we are involved in certain environmental matters with respect to our facility in newark  new york 
although we have reserved for expenses related to this potential exposure  there can be no assurance that such reserve will be adequate 
the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 

table of contents with respect to our battery products  we typically offer warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
with respect to our communications accessory products  we typically offer a four year warranty 
we also offer a year warranty on our volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
we provide for a reserve for these potential warranty expenses  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt obligations expected interest payments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total expected interest payments are calculated assuming a annual rate on the outstanding revolver balance  plus associated fees related to our credit facility  the applicable annual interest rates ranging from to for various notes payable for equipment and vehicles  and a annual rate on the outstanding principal related to the subordinated convertible notes payable 
purchase obligations consist of commitments for property  plant and equipment  open purchase orders for materials and supplies  and other general commitments for various service contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
outlook our operating plan calls for us to generate revenue of  and operating income of approximately  on the base business 
management cautions that the timing of orders and shipments may cause some variability in quarterly results 
see overview section for additional information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates and assumptions that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
revenue recognition product sales in general  revenues from the sale of products are recognized when products are shipped 
when products are shipped with terms that require transfer of title upon delivery at a customer s location  revenues are recognized on date of delivery 
a provision is made at the time the revenue is recognized for warranty costs expected to be incurred 
customers  including distributors  do not have a general right of return on products shipped 

table of contents service contracts revenue from the sale of installation services is recognized upon customer acceptance  generally the date of installation 
revenue from fixed price engineering contracts is recognized on a proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
revenue from time and material engineering contracts is recognized as work progresses through monthly billings of time and materials as they are applied to the work pursuant to the terms in the respective contract 
revenue from customer maintenance agreements is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the related agreements  which range from six months to three years 
technology contracts we recognize revenue using the proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the contract 
elements of cost include direct material  labor and overhead 
if a loss on a contract is estimated  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
we allocate costs to all technology contracts based upon actual costs incurred including an allocation of certain research and development costs incurred 
deferred revenue for each source of revenues  we defer recognition if i evidence of an agreement does not exist  ii delivery or service has not occurred  iii the selling price is not fixed or determinable  or iv collectability is not reasonably assured 
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
our inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
we record provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand  technology developments or other economic factors 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are our purchasing practices  material and product obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials see item a risk factors for further information on foreign regulations 
we manage our exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
warranties we maintain provisions related to normal warranty claims by customers 
we evaluate these reserves quarterly based on actual experience with warranty claims to date and our assessment of additional claims in the future 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly assess all of our long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through the assistance of an independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows 
the discount rate used by us in our evaluation approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 
environmental issues environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate  in accordance with fasb s guidance on environmental remediation liabilities 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the revised fasb guidance for business combinations  the purchase price paid to effect an acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at fair value 
in accordance with fasb s guidance for the accounting of goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead measure these assets for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
we amortize intangible assets that have definite lives so that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized over their weighted average estimated useful life 

table of contents the impairment test for goodwill consists of a comparison of the fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which it is assigned 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets with their carrying amounts 
if the intangible assets exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on a discounted cash flow model 
we determine the fair value of our intangibles assets with indefinite lives trademarks through the relief from a royalty income valuation approach 
we conduct our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in october of each fiscal year 
for  we have identified seven goodwill reporting units for testing  and based on our results of the step testing  no impairment charge resulted from such analysis 
for  we have identified four trademarks for testing  and based on our results of the testing  no impairment charge resulted from such analysis 
therefore  no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is indicated for however  due to the narrow margin of passing the step goodwill impairment testing for in the stationary power reporting unit  there is potential for a partial or full impairment of the goodwill value in if the projected operational results are not achieved 
one of the key assumptions for achieving the projected operational results includes revenue growth in the wireless services market 
as of december   the stationary power reporting unit had a goodwill carrying value of  stock based compensation we follow the provisions of fasb s guidance on share based payments  which requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we calculate expected volatility for stock options by taking an average of historical volatility over the past five years and a computation of implied volatility 
a blended volatility factor was deemed to be more appropriate as we believe that implied volatility  a forward looking measure  provides a more market driven valuation related to investors expectations of the volatility of our business  and provides a balance against focusing only on a historical measure 
the computation of expected term was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
income taxes we apply fasb s guidance in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that may be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in  and  we continued to report a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets that cannot be offset by reversing temporary differences in the us  the us and china arising from the conclusion that we would not be able to utilize our us  us and china nol s that had accumulated over time 
the recognition of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset resulted from our evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the assessment of the realizability of the nol s was based on a number of factors including  our history of net operating losses  the volatility of our earnings  our historical operating volatility  our historical ability to accurately forecast earnings for future periods and the continued uncertainty of the general business climate as of the end of we concluded that these factors represent sufficient negative evidence and have concluded that we should record a full valuation allowance under fasb s guidance on the accounting for income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we are exposed to various market risks in the normal course of business  primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
our primary interest rate risk is derived from our outstanding variable rate debt obligation 
in july  we hedged this risk by entering into an interest rate swap arrangement in connection with the term loan component of our previous credit facility 
under the swap arrangement  effective august   we received a fixed rate of interest in exchange for a variable rate 
the swap rate received was for five years and is adjusted accordingly for a eurodollar spread incorporated in the agreement 
correspondingly  the interest rate swap arrangement we entered into in connection with the term loan under our previous credit facility has expired and we have no further obligations under the interest rate swap arrangement 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in connection with our new credit facility with rbs  the interest rate is variable based on one of two libor rates plus 
the impact of a one percentage point change in the interest rate associated with the rbs credit facility would not have a material impact on our interest expense 
we are subject to foreign currency risk  due to fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar 
in the year ended december   approximately of our sales were denominated in us dollars 
the remainder of our sales was denominated in uk pounds sterling  euros  australian dollars  canadian dollars  indian rupee and chinese yuan renminbi 
a change in the value of the pound sterling  the euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  the rupee or the yuan renminbi to the us dollar would have impacted our revenues in that period by less than 
we monitor the relationship between the us dollar and other currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in these foreign currencies as appropriate to safeguard against the fluctuations in the currency relative to the us dollar 
we maintain manufacturing operations in north america  europe and asia  and export products internationally 
we purchase materials and sell our products in foreign currencies  and therefore currency fluctuations may impact our pricing of products sold and materials purchased 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries maintain their books in local currency  which is translated into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements 
a change in local currency relative to the us dollar would have impacted our consolidated income before taxes by approximately  or approximately
