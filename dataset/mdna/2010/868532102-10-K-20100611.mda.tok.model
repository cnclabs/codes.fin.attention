critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates in these financial statements include revenue recognition  provision for sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates for useful lives associated with long lived assets  asset impairments  net realizable value of inventories  certain accrued liabilities and provision for income taxes and tax valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures in relation to this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for those customers which have a hub arrangement  we recognize revenue when our products are transferred from the hub to the customer s manufacturing facility or to its assembly subcontractor s manufacturing facility 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  with the exception of certain products  we defer the recognition of revenue to all our distributors  domestic and foreign  and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end customers 
following a prior period change in our terms and conditions to eliminate return rights for distributors for certain products  we continued to defer revenue recognition until the distributors had sold these parts as we would grant concessions and accept some returns for a period of time after the change 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  for sales to distributors of certain products that are not returnable  we had established sufficient history of not granting concessions to begin to recognize revenue on such items upon their shipment 
at the end of each period our distributors provide us an inventory balance report which allows us to determine products sold to their end customers 
we also provide custom processing services for manufacture of integrated circuits  using customer owned designs and mask tooling 
under this custom processing service arrangement  a tangible product is sold  and we bear the risk of loss until title is passed 
title to the product under the custom processing service arrangement is passed to the customer at the time of shipment 
from time to time  deferred revenue results from up front billings to customers under non recurring engineering nre contracts 
we recognize revenue from our nre contracts upon completion of contract milestones  which corresponds to when we provide the services and or products 
revenue is deferred for any amounts received prior to completion of contract milestones  such as amounts to be received upon delivery of proto type product  if such a delivery is not an agreed upon milestone 
some of our nre contracts include formal customer acceptance provisions in which case  at the end of each period  we determine whether customer acceptance has been obtained for the specific milestone 
if customer acceptance has not been obtained  we defer the recognition of such revenue until customer acceptance is obtained 
sales returns and other allowances we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analyses of outstanding return material authorization and allowance authorization data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due in order to reduce our net receivable from such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have had in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur 
warranty for sales through distributors  our policy is to replace under warranty defective products at our own expense for a period of days from date of shipment 
this period may be extended in certain cases 
this liability is limited to replacement of the product and freight and delivery costs 
in certain cases  we may pay for rework 
this warranty shall not apply to any of such products which have been repaired or altered  except by us  or which shall have been subjected to misuse  negligence  or accident 
we do not extend the original warranty period of any product which has either been repaired or replaced by us 
we reserve for estimated warranty costs in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
the estimate is based on historical experience 
the warranty reserve as of april  was  allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example due to bankruptcy  etc in these cases  significant management judgment and estimates must be made based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due and reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific allowances are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that affects the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
second  a minimum allowance is established for all other customer receivables as a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
standard manufacturing cost includes materials  labor  and overhead costs including depreciation  and includes factors for estimated production yield and throughput time 
we determine net realizable value of our inventories based on the last selling price  net of selling cost  of our products prior to the balance sheet date 
if there has been no recent sale of a particular product  the expected selling price  net of selling cost is deemed as the net realizable value 
inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
any adjustment to write down inventory to net realizable value is charged to the cost of sales in the period that the adjustment is made 
additionally  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand during the next twelve months  which involves a great deal of management judgment on our part 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand and inventories that we consider obsolete are reserved 
we make judgments in establishing inventory reserves and do not establish a reserve if management believes certain excess or obsolete inventory will be sold 
in addition  we age our inventory based on start date 
inventory that has been inactive for more than one year is considered slow moving inventory and is also reserved 
additions to the provision are charged to the cost of sales 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reduction of the allowance until these inventories are subsequently sold or scrapped 
any proceeds received will favorably affect gross margins 
while we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and consider technological obsolescence when adjusting inventory carrying values to market values  it is possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and will be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined using various approaches  including discounted future cash flows  independent appraisals or other relevant methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
historically  we have not had the need for an impairment charge on our long lived assets 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
such deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
our management must determine the probability that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that recovery is unlikely  then a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset must be recorded by increasing income tax expense 
as of april   we believe that our deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will be utilized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to utilize or recover our deferred tax assets  an additional income tax expense would be incurred in the period in which it was determined that the recovery is not probable 
on february   california governor arnold schwarzenegger signed budget legislation containing significant california tax law changes including tax related economic incentives and tax increases 
the enacted legislation includes an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula for most businesses starting in tax years beginning on or after january  if we adopt such a formula  we expect the california effective tax rate will be lower 
as a result of the legislation during fiscal  we have revalued our california deferred tax assets expected to be realized after april  the authoritative guidance of income taxes provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this authoritative guidance also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
this authoritative guidance requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate  and consequently affect our operating results 
the reserve amount associated with this authoritative guidance was determined with considerable judgment and estimation  and is continuously monitored by management based on the best information available including changes in tax regulations  the outcome of relevant court cases  ongoing tax audits  and other information 
during the fiscal year ended april   the liability for uncertain tax positions less accrued interest and penalties decreased from  to  of the total  of uncertain tax benefits   represents the amount that if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods 
we cannot conclude on the range of cash payments that will be made within the next twelve months associated with our uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation we apply the fair value recognition provisions of stock based compensation  and accordingly use the prospective transition method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options  based on the estimated fair value of those awards at their grant date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  which requires various subjective assumptions including expected term  expected volatility and risk free interest rates 
we record the cost as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee or director is to perform services in connection with the award generally over the vesting period of the award 
accounting for available for sale investments our available for sale portfolio in fiscal includes ars and municipal bonds 
these securities are reported at fair value 
the ars held by us are primarily backed by pools of student loans and are guaranteed by the united states department of education 
in addition  all ars held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of ars  the fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model and included a discount factor for illiquidity of the ars market 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amounts of cash flows  liquidity of the underlying security  expected holding periods and contractual terms of the security 
we review our securities for impairments in accordance with the authoritative guidance and other related fasb guidance in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are charged to the statement of income and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
in light of the current market condition for ars  we developed different scenarios for the significant inputs used in the discounted cash flow model  including  but not limited to liquidity discount of basis points for the current ars market  and the timing of recovery of ars market from three to six years 
the estimated fair value of our ars ranges from  to  or to of par value 
we believe this estimated range of fair value of our ars is appropriate taking into consideration historical ars market data  the possibility of development of a secondary market for ars  recent market participant behaviors  and public policy implications associated with the student loan based ars market 
we have concluded that the fair value of our ars was  as of april  and recorded a temporary impairment of  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments we operate in the highly cyclical global semiconductor market  evidenced by fluctuating demand cycles for our products 
after three fiscal years of sales growth in through  sales declined in fiscal and primarily due to a reduction in demand from one of our significant customers  as its products that use our el inverter ics experienced significantly reduced sales 
our fiscal sales also declined due to the start of the global recession in the second half of fiscal our overall custom processing services sales experienced alternating years of growth and decline during fiscal through  with and being growth years 
we have not focused on expanding this portion of our business 
during the second half of fiscal overall sales of products in all of our target markets increased compared to the first half following their decline in the recent global recession that began for us in the third quarter of fiscal during the recession  quarterly sales run rate reduced from a previous level of approximately  to a trough of  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal sales were  and  respectively 
the sequential growth of nearly million in the fourth fiscal quarter was due primarily to increased demand for medical ultrasound analog switches and high voltage ultrasound pulser circuits and chipsets  as well as increases in led drivers for general lighting applications and products for our telecom and industrial and other markets 
these increases more than offset a decline in sales of led drivers for backlighting lcd tvs due to our primary customer s transitioning to the models which use our new drivers which allow longer led strings and fewer drivers per tv set 
counter to the cyclical trends experienced by most of our target markets during the past several years  sales in our led lighting and backlighting markets have grown significantly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal quote activity and design wins have been strong in the led lighting and backlighting markets

a breakdown of our total sales to customers in the medical electronics  led lighting  imaging  telecom  and industrial other markets as well as year over year changes are shown below dollars in thousands fiscal years ended year over year markets april  march  change medical electronics led lighting imaging telecom industrial other net sales we have a broad base of customers  which in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple markets 
as such  the assignment of revenue to the aforementioned markets requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
actual results may differ from those reported 
net sales for the fiscal year were  a decrease compared to  for the prior fiscal year  which was primarily due to reduced demand resulting from weakness in the overall economy which began in the second half of fiscal and continued through the first half of in our second fiscal quarter of sales began to recover and continued to increase sequentially through our fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition to the overall weak economy  there were shifts in demand from some of our customers 
for example  one of our largest customers of el inverter ics for cell phones lost market share  lower demand from our customer for our driver ics for a military radio application reduced our telecom shipments  and a general decline in the expansion of optical telecom network infrastructure also reduced telecom shipments 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in sales of our led driver ics for backlighting lcd tvs and for general lighting throughout most of fiscal our sales to the medical electronics market accounted for of total sales in fiscal and decreased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in selling prices of analog switches and high voltage ultrasound pulser ics and chipsets due to increased competition  and to a lesser extent due to lower unit shipments of our analog switches and high voltage ultrasound pulser ics and chipsets due to the weak overall economy 
in recent years  the overall ultrasound market has been shifting from big console systems to transportable and hand carried ultrasound imaging units  which has driven the ultrasound imaging market growth along with product upgrades for console cart wheel machines and large stationary systems 
because of space and power constraints  there are more requirements for integration  and with our high voltage ic technology we have been among the most qualified to support these requirements 
geographically  the imaging equipment market is expanding very rapidly in china  india and many african countries 
traditionally  oems in the united states  germany  and japan have been the main developers and manufacturers of medical ultrasound machines to whom we have sold our products successfully 
companies in those regions continue to grow and develop new machines 
today we see significant opportunities with medical ultrasound imaging machine companies in china and korea 
this market began to grow for us in fiscal and continued in fiscal the global economic slowdown which began in the second half of fiscal and carried through the first quarter of fiscal negatively impacted sales of capital equipment  including medical ultrasound imaging machines 
our sales in china increased in fiscal over fiscal because of the domestic stimulus funding plan put in place by the chinese government targeted towards key sectors to build up their healthcare infrastructure 
due to the global economic improvement  the global demand for medical ultrasound imaging machines picked up in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal we are expanding our product development activities and product offerings to capitalize on these exciting market growth opportunities 
through the introduction of our new integrated solutions along with our discrete building block product offerings  we believe we will continue to be a major player in this business 
sales to the led lighting market of  in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due primarily to significantly increased shipments of our high voltage led driver ics for backlighting lcd tvs with led backlighting units led tvs which have ramped up volume production during the past several quarters at a tier one oem prior to a decline in the fourth quarter as the customer transitioned to its models which use our new drivers which allow longer led strings and fewer drivers per tv set 
during fiscal we also began shipping production quantities to three second tier oems 
additionally  general lighting led application sales have increased compared to fiscal we expect that sales of led driver ics for led tvs will continue to ramp in fiscal as led backlighting unit blu prices continue to decline and at the same time led backlighting offers far superior and compelling features versus the conventional ccfl backlighting such as higher contrast ratio  light weight  thin form factor  and very low power consumption 
according to certain industry projections  the number of led tvs sold in calendar will increase at least four fold versus calendar we also expect that sales of our led driver ics for general lighting applications will continue to grow in fiscal sales to the imaging market in fiscal decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to significantly reduced demand for our customers products and the weak overall economy 
this was partially offset by increased shipments of our el inverter ics to a hand set oem for a new family of products during the second half of fiscal we are one of the key providers of el driver ics for cell phones and are also pursuing el backlighting applications in other products  such as netbooks  notebooks and laptops 
in the other major component of our imaging market  drivers for non impact inkjet printers and plotters as well as other displays  sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the overall weak economy  however  during our second half of fiscal sales of these products increased compared to the first half 
we are one of the key providers of driver ics for hand held instruments and watches and the leading supplier in the high end industrial printer market  with both standard and custom products 
sales to the telecom market in fiscal decreased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in sales was primarily due to lower shipments of driver ics for a military radio application and to a lesser extent reduced demand for high voltage mems driver ics for optical to optical switching applications 
sales to the industrial other market decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the overall economic downturn that began in the second half of fiscal and continued through the first half of fiscal  however sales in our fourth fiscal quarter increased significantly from the quarterly run rate experienced in the first three fiscal quarters 
our current growth strategy relies on our ability to continuously and successfully introduce and market new innovative products that meet our customers requirements 
our principal geographic markets are in asia  the us  and europe

this decrease in international net sales was primarily due to the global economic downturn and the decline in shipments of our el inverters to manufacturing locations in asia  excluding china 
the increase in sales to china was primarily due to higher shipments of our drivers of led lighting and backlighting products and to a lesser extent due to higher medical ultrasound sales 
the decrease in sales to the united states was primarily due to the global economic downturn and the migration of contract manufacturing to asia 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing raw silicon wafers  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support  and net charges for excess or obsolete inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower overall sales  unfavorable product mix  reduced average selling prices in certain medical ultrasound products  and higher inventory reserves 
these factors were partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs

the increase of  in r d expense for the current year is primarily due to increased costs for masks and tooling in support of development activities for advanced circuit designs of  higher labor benefits expense of  due to an increase during fiscal of  in fair value of the company s deferred compensation plan nqdcp assets compared to a decrease of  during fiscal  along with higher employee stock compensation expense of  partially offset by lower profit sharing bonus and other benefits  and due to higher design consulting expense and legal expense for patent filings 
these increases were partially offset by reduced usage of wafer fab services in support of development activities for advanced manufacturing processes of  many of the fifty products under development are expected for release in the next two years

our sales to the medical electronics market accounted for of total sales in fiscal and increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales increase was attributable to higher unit shipments of our high voltage ultrasound pulser ics and medical custom processing services 
these increases were partially offset by reduced selling prices of analog switches and multiplexers and our high voltage ultrasound pulser ics  as we experienced increased pressure to reduce prices due to increased competition

our effective tax rate of was less than the combined federal and state tax rate due to the benefits of tax exempt investment income  domestic production activities deduction and r d credits  and shifts of income among jurisdiction with different tax rates  partially offset by the adverse impact of stock based compensation expenses 
financial condition overview total cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments balance as of april   was  compared with  on march   and  on march  the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from  of cash provided by operating activities  an increase in ars fair value of  and proceeds from exercises of stock options and espp of  partially offset by capital expenditures of  working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
working capital was  an increase of  from  as of march  this increase in working capital was mostly the result of an increase in cash provided by operating activities of  and partial redemptions of our ars of  which were reinvested in short term securities 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal in summary  our cash flows were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended april  march  march  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended april   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  in fiscal this decrease of  resulted from a lesser net income after non cash adjustments of  and a decrease from changes in assets and liabilities totaling  the lower non cash adjustments were primarily an unrealized gain from short term investments compared to an unrealized loss last year and a reduction in deferred income taxes compared to an increase last year  partially offset by higher provision for excess and obsolete inventories due to reduced overall demand during the first half of fiscal  and higher stock based compensation expense 
also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were increased trade accounts receivable due to a significant increase in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to a decrease in the second half of fiscal  and due to increases in prepaid expenses and inventories  while income taxes payable decreased 
these changes in non cash adjustments were partially offset by increases in trade accounts payable  prepaid income taxes and deferred revenue  as our distributors increased the amount of inventory being carried  while in fiscal they decreased inventories 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments and redemptions of long term investments 
cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal year compared to cash used of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we bought  more of short term investments than we sold 
partially offsetting this use of cash were par value redemptions of our ars totaling  our capital expenditures in fiscal of  were lower than in fiscal our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of ars  municipal bonds and money market funds 
the ars we hold have a par value of  they are in the form of auction rate bonds backed by a pool of student loans  whose interest rates were reset every seven to thirty five days reset period through an auction process 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  at the end of each reset period  investors could sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal  the ars market experienced failures 
in general  for each unsuccessful auction  the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for each ars unless the interest earned reaches the maximum amount stipulated by the prospectus 
the principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities  or final payments come due according to contractual maturities ranging from to years 
although no assurance can be given  we expect that we will receive the full principal associated with these auction rate securities through one of the means described above 
we received partial redemptions of  at par value in fiscal during fiscal we received payments totaling  representing of two of our ars holdings and and of two other ars holdings  respectively  all parts of which were redeemed at par value 
subsequent to april   we received two payments of  and  at par value  representing and  respectively  of two ars holdings 
we continue to believe that the credit quality of the ars we hold is high as they are primarily backed by student loans  are insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education  and continue to be rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
while the auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments for some period of time  we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  or other business requirements 
as of april   we had approximately  of working capital  including approximately  of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and we have generated cash from our operations for the past several years 
as of april   due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of ars  all of our investments in ars were classified as level and the fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model and included a discount factor for illiquidity of the ars market 
this level fair value of  represents approximately of total assets measured at fair value 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amounts of cash flows  liquidity of the underlying security  expected holding periods and contractual terms of the ars 
using this discounted cash flow model  we determined that there was a temporary impairment of  to par value of our ars as of april  this unrealized loss reflects the decline in the estimated fair value of these ars in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
we concluded that the impairment losses were temporary in part due to the following the decline in market value is due to unusual general market conditions  these investments are of high credit quality and a significant portion of them are collateralized and are guaranteed by the us department of education  there have been no defaults on the ars we held as of april   their aaa or aaa credit ratings have not been reduced as of april  we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs  and recently  some ars were redeemed at par value 
we received partial redemptions of  at par value in fiscal during fiscal we received payments totaling  representing of two of our ars holdings and and of two other ars holdings  respectively  all parts of which were redeemed at par value 
subsequent to april   we received two payments of  and  representing and  respectively  of two ars holdings  which were redeemed at par value 
during fiscal  capital spending consisted primarily of test capacity expansion equipment  software and computer hardware equipment upgrades 
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the and plans and sales of stock through the espp  reclassification of non cash excess tax benefit from operating into financing activities  and repurchases of stock on the open market 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  primarily from proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal cash provided by financing activities was  during both fiscal and  we did not repurchase any shares from the open market 
we expect to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions in fiscal we believe that we have substantial production capacity in place to handle any projected increase in business in fiscal most of our  of property  plant and equipment are located in the united states 
we also believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements through the next twelve months 
fiscal operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  in fiscal the increase in fiscal year compared to resulted primarily from a greater net income after non cash adjustments and increase from changes in assets and liabilities 
the higher non cash adjustments were primarily greater increases in deferred income taxes  and unrealized loss from short term investments  partially offset by lower provision for excess and obsolete inventories and for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities were greater reductions in trade accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses and other assets 
these changes in non cash adjustments were partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable and a decrease in deferred revenue  as our distributors reduced the amount of inventory on hand  while in fiscal their inventories on hand increased 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal year compared to cash provided of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we purchased  of short term investments more than we sold 
partially offsetting this use of cash were redemptions at par value of our ars totaling  our capital expenditures in fiscal were lower than in fiscal financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the and plans and sales of stock through the espp  reclassification of non cash excess tax benefit from operating into financing activities as required by the authoritative guidance of stock compensation  and repurchases of stock on the open market 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  compared to net cash used of  in the prior year 
during fiscal  we did not repurchase any shares of our stock on the open market  whereas in we bought back  shares for off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements 
noted below under contractual obligations are various commitments we have associated with our business such as lease commitments  open purchase obligations and other items that are not recorded on our balance sheet  since we have not yet received the related goods or services as of april  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at april   which consist of operating facility leases and open volume purchase orders which provide volume discounts 
such obligations are expected to have minimal effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through april rental expense  net of sublease income  amounted to  for fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
amounts exclude the obligation related to the recently negotiated lease extension of our six inch wafer fabrication facility  which was executed subsequent to april  effective april   we adopted the authoritative guidance of income taxes 
as of april   the liability for uncertain tax positions  net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments  state income taxes  interest deductions  and other receivables was  as of april   we have accrued  of interest and  of penalties associated with its uncertain tax positions 
we cannot conclude on the range of cash payments that will be made within the next twelve months associated with these uncertain tax positions 
common stock repurchases there were no share repurchase activities for fiscal years ended april  or march  since the inception of the repurchase program in through april   we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of  upon their repurchase  shares are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares 
as of april   the number of shares remained authorized for future repurchases under this program was  recent accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued authoritative guidance for transfers of financial assets  which identifies specific disclosure objectives  and explicitly states that these objectives apply regardless of whether this guidance requires specific disclosures 
the specific disclosures required are minimum requirements and an entity may need to supplement the required disclosures depending on the facts and circumstances of a transfer  the nature of an entity s continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets  and the effect of an entity s continuing involvement on the transferor s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
disclosures required by other gaap for a particular form of continuing involvement shall be considered when determining whether the disclosure objectives of this guidance have been met 
this guidance must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november  fiscal year beginning on april   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
this guidance must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
we are currently assessing the potential effect that the adoption of the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements  but do not expect it to have a material effect 
in june  fasb issued authoritative guidance to eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  among other changes 
it is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november  fiscal year beginning on april   for interim periods within the first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
we are currently assessing the potential effect that the adoption of the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements  but do not expect it to have a material effect 
in january  fasb issued an update to the authoritative guidance on improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update requires disclosure as follows a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons of transfers 
in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales issuances  and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
in addition  this update clarifies existing disclosures as follows a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position 
a reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities 
a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in either level or level this update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  fiscal quarter ended april   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years fiscal quarter and year beginning on april  
we are currently assessing the potential effect that the adoption of the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements  but do not expect it to have a material effect 
in february  the fasb amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement for sec filers as defined in asu to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
this change alleviates potential conflicts with current sec guidance 
the amended guidance also clarifies that an entity that is a conduit bond obligor for conduit debt securities that are traded in a public market a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over the counter market  including local or regional markets must evaluate subsequent events through the date of issuance of its financial statements and must disclose such date 
there is no change to the guidance for all other entities  who will continue to be required to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are available to be issued  and must disclose such date 
for entities  other than conduit bond obligors  the provisions are effective upon issuance fiscal quarter ended april  
conduit bond obligors will be required to apply the asu s requirements in fiscal periods ending after june  the application of the provisions did not materially affect our results of operations or financial position as of and for the period ended april  in april  the fasb has issued an amendment on guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions

a description of the overall arrangement 
b 
a description of each milestone and related contingent consideration 
c 
a determination of whether each milestone is considered substantive

are substantive 
e 
the amount of consideration recognized during the period for the milestone or milestones

we are currently assessing the potential effect to our consolidated financial statements in applying this provision  but do not expect it to have material effect 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to financial market risks primarily due to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our investment securities 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments  and our holdings are for purposes other than trading 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of ars  municipal bonds and money market funds 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
based on our investments and cash and cash equivalent balance as of april   one percentage point change in interest rates would cause change in our annual interest income by an amount of approximately  as of april   we had no long term debt outstanding 
ars are subject to the risk that the secondary market might fail to provide the liquidity opportunity at the rate reset points 
this risk  which we have encountered with regard to our ars  manifests itself in sponsoring broker dealers withdrawing from the auction process that provides the rate reset and liquidity 
we recorded a  temporary impairment in value as of april   which decreased from  as of march  in the event we need to access the funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
the ars we hold have contractual maturities generally between to years and had a total par value of  as of april   compared to  as of march  they are in the form of auction rate bonds backed by a pool of student loans  whose interest rates were reset every seven to thirty five days through an auction process prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the ars held by us are backed by student loans and are guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
in addition  all ars held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
as our ars are of high credit rating  we believe the credit risk is very low 
if the issuer of the ars is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the ars  or the united states government fails to support its guaranty of the obligations  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the ars and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we expect that we will receive the principal associated with these auction rate securities through one of the means described above 
foreign currency exchange risks we do not hedge any potential risk from any foreign currency exposure 
with our operations in hong kong  we face exposure to an adverse change in the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar 
we believe that our exposure is relatively small  thus we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate this foreign currency exposure 
likewise  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
as the level of activity at this operation changes over time  actual currency gains or losses could have an adverse impact to the consolidated financial statements
