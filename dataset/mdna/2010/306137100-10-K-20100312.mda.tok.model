investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview due to the continuing economic downturn  and as a result of unanticipated mergers and acquisition activity among three of our largest oem partners  our revenue and net income fell short of our expectations for despite the economic downturn  we continued to make progress toward our goal of ramping up the sale of falconstor branded products to end users  what we call non oem sales 
we have made investments in our sales and our marketing functions  increasing headcount and spending on advertising  promotions and other public relations  to increase market awareness of the branded products 
we also focused and increased our efforts in creating falconstor branded storage appliances 
we had previously put most of our non oem sales efforts behind falconstor branded software 
but feedback we received from our resellers and the end users suggested that we could increase sales if we offered storage appliances with our software installed on hardware 
to meet this demand  we have created falconstor branded gateway appliances and complete storage appliances with integrated disks 
these combined efforts led to a increase in gross non oem software license revenue in we expect that the investment we made in these areas  combined with an improved macroeconomic environment  will cause our non oem sales to continue to increase in unfortunately  the gains we made in non oem sales in were offset by declines in our oem sales 
during  three of our largest oem customers emc  sun microsystems  and com became involved in transactions that had substantial negative effects on our revenues 
in july  emc acquired data domain  inc this acquisition resulted in changes to emc s product lines and sales and marketing focus 
as result  sales of the emc products that incorporate our software declined 
total revenue from emc on an annual basis was still of our total revenue for while our agreement with emc runs through  there are no minimum revenue commitments from emc 
due to the changes at emc we cannot say whether emc will account for or more of our revenue in in june  oracle corporation announced that it had reached an agreement to buy sun microsystems 
before completing the acquisition  oracle was required to get approval for the purchase from various jurisdictions worldwide 
this approval process took several months  and at various points the statements of the regulators cast doubt on whether the transaction would be approved 
ultimately  the purchase of sun was not completed until january during this period of delay and uncertainty  sun suffered a substantial decline in its sales  including sales of the sun products that incorporate our software 
while for the full year  software license revenues from sun declined only  we fully anticipated at the outset of that sun s software license revenues would increase when compared with oracle is continuing to sell the sun products that incorporate our software  but we do not yet know the level of sales and marketing effort and support that oracle will put into sales of these products 
in december of each of the past several years  com  through a chinese subsidiary  had placed a multi million dollar order with us for licenses to our software 
in december   hewlett packard announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase com 
this agreement caused com to vary from its historical licensing pattern and to place a substantially smaller order than previous years 
the purchase of com by hp has not yet been completed 
we do not know when or if com will continue to license our software 

table of contents collectively  these three merger and acquisition events were the major factor contributing to the twenty four percent decrease in oem software license revenue 
overall  our revenues for the full year increased to million from million in this is a year over year increase in revenues 
we currently anticipate that revenue will increase in net loss for the year was million compared with net income of million in we had stock based compensation expense which relates to stock options and restricted stock we grant to employees  officers and directors as part of our incentive compensation plan  and to some consultants as payment for services of million in and million in  which is reflected in the net results for each year 
we look to operating income as another measure of our progress 
this number enables us to measure and to compare our results of operations from one year to the next 
operating loss for was million  compared with operating income of million in these numbers again include stock based compensation expense 
we attribute the decline in operating income from to primarily to the shortfall in anticipated revenue from our oem customers 
we planned our expenses for based on our assumptions about revenue growth 
when the oem revenue fell short  the result was a loss from operations 
this same oem revenue shortfall negatively impacted gross margin  another important measure of our business 
among other things  gross margin measures our ability to scale our business 
our gross margins tend to increase as our software license revenue increases 
our gross margin for was compared with for the impact of the equity based compensation expense on gross margin was equivalent to for each of and the decline of oem revenue was particularly harmful to our gross margin because the cost of oem revenues tends to be much lower than the cost of channel revenue 
operating margin is a measure of operating efficiency 
we incur research and development expenses before the product is offered for licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering and testing  but also include other items such as the depreciation and amortization of hardware and software used in development 
we also have expenses for software support  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
our operating margin decreased in to  compared with in the impact of the equity based compensation expense on operating margin in and was equivalent to each year 
our focus for will be to continue to manage our business with a view towards long term success and growth 
our goal is to keep making the company more profitable  but we do not manage the business to meet quarterly or annual earnings targets 
our continued ability to generate cash from operations allows us to put money back into the business to continue its growth 
we anticipate that our cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses will be higher in as compared with  as a result of the investments we made throughout  which will now have a full year impact on the key factors we look to for our future business prospects are our ability to establish and to expand relationships with resellers  and sales and re orders by those resellers  our ability to establish and to expand relationships with key industry oems  and sales by those oems  growth in deferred revenue  the development and sales of our new products  re orders from existing customers  and the growth of the overall market for data protection and storage solutions 

table of contents we anticipate that in software license sales by resellers and  to a lesser extent  direct licenses to end users  or our non oem business  will continue to grow in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales 
software license revenue from our non oem business increased in increasing sales from our non oem business remains an area of focus for us and in we made significant investments in our sales force and in our marketing team to help grow these sales 
we also have instituted  and we will be instituting further  support  training and incentive programs intended to increase sales by resellers 
we continue to enhance our reseller program 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers to assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these resellers typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  or combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependent on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs 
if resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is not functioning as promised  or is not providing adequate return on investment  or if the customers are not satisfied with the level of support they are receiving from the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions to their customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an important indicator of our business prospects 
in  we signed agreements with new resellers worldwide 
the type of resellers with whom we are signing agreements has continued to evolve 
while we still sign agreements with strong local and regional resellers  we have also entered into reseller agreements with national and multi national resellers who have their own distribution networks 
the enhanced distribution and marketing networks offered by these larger resellers should help us to continue to grow our sales 
we also terminated relationships with resellers who we believed were not properly selling our products in we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and to discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
despite the decline in oem revenue  oem relationships continue to be important to us for two main reasons first  sales by our oem partners contribute to our revenues 
overall  total revenue from oems accounted for approximately of our revenues in  down from in accordingly  the loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
second  having our products selected by respected  established industry leaders signals to customers  resellers and other potential oem partners that our products are quality products that add value to their enterprise 
before licensing software  oem partners typically undertake broad reviews of many of the competing software solutions available 
the choice of our products by major industry participants validates both the design and the capabilities of the products and our product roadmaps 
we do everything we can to assure that our products meet the needs of our oem partners and their customers 
however  as was shown in we are vulnerable to strategic and tactical decisions made by our oem partners that can result in lower revenue for us 
in addition to potential changes in ownership and the effects that can result  we cannot control decisions by our oem partners to change their product or marketing mix in ways that impact sales of products licensed by the oems from us 
over our history  we have entered into oem agreements with partners  only to see those oem partners change their strategies and make significant reductions in their commitments to the products that incorporate our technology 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts attributable to future support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for our products is sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreements are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products or by our oem partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenues thus indicates growth in our installed base and end user and oem satisfaction with our products and our maintenance and support services 
our deferred revenue increased to million as of december   compared with million as of december  we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in 
table of contents as discussed above  consolidation in the data protection and network storage market continued in the consolidation significantly impacted our revenue 
our expenses increased in from million in to million in this is well below the increase from to  which was  and the increase from to  which was 
however  the increase in expenses outpaced our increase in revenues 
most of the increase in expenses related to our successful efforts to continue to build our non oem business 
we continue to believe that the investments we have made in our business will provide a pay off in the long run through increased sales and market share 
included in our operating expenses for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
we expect to continue to be affected by seasonality of the information technology business on a quarterly basis 
historically  information technology spending has been higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewhat slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
while our results were skewed by the impact of the strategic transactions affecting our oem customers  our quarterly results reflected this seasonality in  and we anticipate that our quarterly results for will show the effects of seasonality as well 
accounting rules relating to share based compensation expense continued to have a negative impact on our earnings in on an on going basis we weigh the impact of the expense on our consolidated financial statements against the impact of discontinuing the grant of equity based compensation to our worldwide workforce 
it continues to be our view that the opportunity to participate in the growth of our company is an important motivating factor for our current employees and a valuable recruiting tool for new employees 
we will thus continue to apply the criteria and the methodology we have used in the past to determine grants of stock options or other equity based compensation to our employees 
for the management of our business and the review of our progress  we will continue to look to our results before share based compensation expense 
we will use these non gaap financial measures in making operating decisions because they measure the results of our day to day operations and because they provide a more consistent basis for evaluating and comparing our results across different periods 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the year ended december  our operating expenses increased from million in to million in included in our operating expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
net loss for the year ended december  was million compared with net income of million for the year ended december  included in our net loss for the year ended december  was an income tax benefit of million compared with an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  the million income tax benefit was primarily attributable to i a benefit of million related to research and development credits we recognized during  and ii the impact of our full year effective tax rate on our pre tax losses for our revenue growth in as compared with was primarily driven by increases in both our maintenance and our software services revenues 
this growth was offset by slight declines in our total software license revenues of for the year ended december  as compared with the same period although our software license revenue declined during compared with  our gross software license revenues from non oem partners increased during compared with  while our gross software license revenues from oem partners decreased by during compared with the increase in our non oem partner gross software license revenues was primarily driven by our ongoing focus and investments on the falconstor branded non oem channel business  which resulted in increases in software licenses for our network storage solution software from both new customers and our installed customer base 
the decrease in our oem partner gross software license revenues was primarily attributable to the merger and acquisition activity that adversely impacted some of our key oem partners  specifically  emc  sun microsystems and com 
as a result of the current macroeconomic environment  we continued to experience slowed revenue growth  particularly in software license revenues  as a result of the downturn in information technology spending and disruptions in the global financial markets  which commenced during the third quarter of and continued throughout however  because of our well established installed customer base  revenue from our maintenance agreements were not as significantly impacted as compared with our software license revenues 
overall  total revenue contribution from our oem partners decreased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with total revenue from non oem partners increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december  as compared with 
table of contents expenses increased in all aspects of our business as we continued to invest in our future by increasing headcount both domestically and internationally 
to support our expected growth  we increased our worldwide headcount to employees as of december   as compared with employees as of december  as we stated throughout  our investments in our future through additional headcount  specifically in sales and marketing functions for our non oem channel  would result in lower operating profits and margins 
however  we have already began to recognize returns on our investments from our non oem channel business as indicated by the growth in our gross software license revenues from this part of our business 
we anticipate that these investments will continue to provide positive returns and accelerated sales momentum into  and that these investments are in line with our long term outlook 
finally  we continue to invest in our infrastructure by continued capital expenditures  particularly with purchases of equipment in support of our existing and future product offerings 
revenues year ended december  revenues software license revenue maintenance revenue software services and other revenue total revenues year over year percentage growth software license revenue maintenance revenue software services and other revenue total percentage growth software license revenue software license revenue is comprised of software licenses sold through our oems  and through i value added resellers  and ii distributors  and or iii directly to end users collectively non oems 
these revenues are recognized when  among other requirements  we receive a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold and the software and permanent key codes are delivered to the customer 
software license revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  software license revenue represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in software license revenues was primarily attributable to a decline of in gross software license revenues from our oem partners as a result of the merger and acquisition activity surrounding some of our key oem partners during the year ended december   as compared with the same period in this decrease was offset by the growth of in gross software license revenues from our non oem partners during the year ended december   as compared with the same period in over the past several years  we have experienced broader market acceptance of our software applications and we have continued to offer new product solutions  which has resulted in increased demand for our software solutions 
additionally  during we focused our investments on the falconstor branded non oem channel business as we feel this is in line with our long term outlook 
however  overall software license revenues continued to be impacted by the downturn in information technology spending as a result of the current macroeconomic environment  which commenced during the second half of  and continued throughout while we anticipate this trend to continue into  we also anticipate that our investments in the falconstor branded business will result in our non oem generated software license revenue to grow at a greater rate in future years as compared with our oem generated software license revenue 

table of contents maintenance revenue maintenance revenue is comprised of software maintenance and technical support services 
revenues derived from maintenance and technical support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance term 
maintenance revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the major factor behind the increase in maintenance revenue was an increase in the number of maintenance and technical support contracts we sold 
as we are in business longer  and as we license more software to new customers and grow our installed customer base  we expect the amount of maintenance and technical support contracts we have to grow as well 
while we expect our maintenance revenue to continue to grow primarily because i the majority of our new customers purchase maintenance and support contracts  and ii the majority of our growing existing customer base renewed their maintenance and support contracts after their initial contracts expire  the slowed growth in software license revenues we have experienced since the second half of and throughout  as discussed above  has impacted the typical maintenance revenue growth levels we have experienced historically year over year 
software services and other revenue software services and other revenues are comprised of professional services primarily related to the implementation of our software  engineering services  and sales of computer hardware 
professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the related services are performed 
revenue from engineering services is primarily related to customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenue from engineering services is recognized in the period in which the services are completed 
we have transactions in which we purchase hardware and bundled this hardware with our software and sell this bundled solution to our customer base 
our software is not essential to the functionality of the bundled hardware 
the amount of revenue allocated to the software and hardware bundle is recognized as revenue in the period delivered provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we further separate the software sales revenue from the hardware revenue for purposes of classification in the consolidated statements of operations in a systematic and rational manner based on their deemed relative fair values 
software services and other revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in software services and other revenue was primarily due to increases in both i computer hardware sales  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in  and ii our professional services revenue  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in the professional services revenue varies from year to year based upon i the number of software license contracts sold during the year  ii the number of our software license customers who elected to purchase professional services  and iii the number of professional services contracts that were completed during the year 
we expect professional services revenues to continue to vary from year to year based upon the number of customers who elect to utilize our professional services upon purchasing our software licenses 
we expect the hardware revenue will continue to vary from year to year based upon the number of customers who wish to have us bundle hardware with our software for one complete solution

cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or to million compared with million for the same period in the increase in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in was primarily due to i an increase in personnel and related costs  ii increased hardware costs associated with the transactions in which we bundled purchased hardware with our software and sold the bundled solution  and iii an increase in amortization related to purchased and capitalized software  specifically related to the acquisition of world venture limited on july  see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements for additional information

these investments in headcount outpaced our actual revenue growth of in  and adversely impacted both our gross profit and gross margins

as of december  and december   our deferred tax assets  net of a deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance  were million and million  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow information is as follows years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances 
our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december  totaled million  as compared with million as of december  cash and cash equivalents totaled million and marketable securities totaled million at december  as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
in  we continued making investments in our infrastructure in anticipation of our current and long term outlook 
as we continue to grow  we will continue to make investments in capital expenditures and we will continue to evaluate the need to increase our headcount 
in the past  we have also used cash to purchase software licenses and to make acquisitions 
we will continue to evaluate potential software license purchases and acquisitions  and if the right opportunity presents itself  we may continue to use our cash for these purposes 
in  we purchased certain assets of world venture limited for an aggregate purchase price of million including transaction and closing costs see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
as of the date of this filing  we have no other agreements  commitments or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions 
we currently do not have any debt and our only significant commitments are related to our office leases

net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   as compared with the same periods in and  respectively  was the result of recording a net loss of million in compared with net income of million and million in and  respectively  adjusted for i the impact of non cash charges  particularly relating to deferred income taxes and tax benefits from stock based awards  and ii adjustments for net changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily changes in our accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenues 
in addition  net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the tax benefits recognized as a result of excess stock based compensation deductions and exercises of stock options  particularly in and based upon the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on stock compensation  tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions are to be presented as cash outflows from operating activities 
we recognized tax benefits related to stock based compensation deductions of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  and net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  included in investing activities for each year are the sales and purchases of our marketable securities 
these represent the sales  maturities and reinvesting of our marketable securities 
the net cash provided by investing activities from the net sales purchases of securities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts will fluctuate from year to year depending on the maturity dates of our marketable securities 
the cash used to purchase property and equipment was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  as discussed above and further in note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements  during we used million for the acquisition of assets  while we did not have any acquisitions of assets in the same periods of or the cash used to purchase software licenses was million for the year ended december  we did not have any significant purchases of software licenses during the years ended december  and we continually evaluate potential software license purchases and acquisitions  and we may continue to make similar investments if we find opportunities that would benefit our business

we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  million and million in   and  respectively 
cash inflows from financing activities were also impacted by the tax benefits recognized as a result of excess stock based compensation deductions and exercises of stock options 
based upon the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on stock compensation  tax benefits relating to excess stock based compensation deductions are to be presented as cash inflows from financing activities 
we recognized tax benefits related to stock based compensation deductions of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as discussed in note fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements  on january   we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on fair value measurements and disclosures 
we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of auction rate securities we hold 
as of december  and  million and million at par value  respectively  of our investments was comprised of auction rate securities 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process  which allows holders to sell their notes  and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals 
during the first quarter of  we began experiencing failed auctions on auction rate securities 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction  the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and continue to reset the next auction date every days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
because there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near term and due to our ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity  the auction rate securities were classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet at both december  and our auction rate securities are classified as available for sale securities and are reflected at fair value 
in prior periods during the auction process  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under fasb authoritative guidance 
however  due to events in the credit markets beginning in the second half of  and continuing throughout  the auction events for most of these instruments failed and  therefore  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model as of both december  and these analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the security  the creditworthiness of the issuer  the timing of the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and an assumption of when the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable and relevant market data  which is limited at this time 
due to these events  we reclassified these instruments as level commencing in and we continued to do so in 
table of contents as of december   we have recorded  cumulatively in other than temporary impairment and a cumulative temporary decline in fair value of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   the losses related to our auction rate securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled  during the first quarter of  we determined that a decline in the fair value of one of our particular investments was the result of a downgrade in the credit rating of certain underlying subordinate securities within the auction rate security 
as a result  we determined a portion of the overall decline in fair value of the auction rate security to be other than temporary due to the creditworthiness of the underlying securities  and accordingly recorded  in other than temporary impairments on this auction rate security 
accordingly  any future fluctuation in the fair value related to any of the auction rate securities that we deem to be temporary  including any recoveries of previous write downs  would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of   of our auction rate securities were called by the issuer at par value 
finally  with the exception of the creditworthiness of one of our auction rate securities  we believe that the remaining temporary declines in fair value are primarily due to liquidity concerns and not to the creditworthiness of the remaining underlying assets  because the majority of the underlying securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
however  if at any time in the future that we determine that a valuation adjustment is other than temporary  we will record a charge to earnings in the period of determination 
our holdings of auction rate securities at par value represented approximately of our cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance as of each december  and  respectively  which we believe allows us sufficient time for the securities to return to full value or to be refinanced by the issuer 
because we believe that the decline in fair value deemed to be temporary is primarily due to liquidity issues in the credit markets  any difference between our estimate and an estimate that would be arrived at by another party would have no impact on our earnings  since such difference would also be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we will continue to re evaluate each of these factors as market conditions change in subsequent periods 
we currently do not have any debt and our only material cash commitments are related to our office leases 
we have an operating lease covering our corporate office facility that expires in february we also have several operating leases related to offices in the united states and foreign countries 
the expiration dates for these leases range from through the following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for all operating leases as of december year ending december  we believe that our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and our expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see item a of part i  risk factors 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  deferred income taxes  accounting for share based payments  acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets  and fair value measurements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on revenue recognition 
software license revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract  a customer purchase order  and or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold for each software license resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider to an end user 
the software license fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms range from to days  depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provided any of our customers extended payment terms 
when a customer licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value based on the contractual maintenance renewal rate 
accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider i historical return rates  ii specific past due accounts  iii analysis of our accounts receivable aging  iv customer payment terms  v historical collections  write offs and returns  vi changes in customer demand and relationships  and vii concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent level of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and our general and administrative expenses 
deferred income taxes 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on income taxes  we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred tax assets  and report such deferred tax assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
we also have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimating foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
this evaluation considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  the effect of temporary differences  the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities  past and projected taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
accounting for share based payments 
as discussed further in note share based payment arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for stock based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on stock compensation 
we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share based compensation expense 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of share based compensation expense reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and other factors 
the expected option term is the number of years that we estimate that the stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise 
the expected term of the awards issued prior to january   was determined using the simplified method prescribed in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
the estimated expected term of the stock awards issued since january  has been determined pursuant to sab no 
additionally  we estimate forfeiture rates based primarily upon historical experiences  adjusted when appropriate for known events or expected trends 
we may adjust share based compensation expense on a quarterly basis for changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of these events and trends  and recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization in the period in which we revised the forfeiture estimate 
if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the share based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december    and  could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions or estimates are used in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 

table of contents acquisitions 
we account for acquisitions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on business combinations 
pursuant to the authoritative guidance  the acquiring company must allocate the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  including intangible assets that can be identified 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
among other sources of relevant information  we use independent appraisals or other valuations to assist in determining the estimated and final recorded fair value of assets and liabilities acquired 
as discussed further in note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements  in we purchased certain assets of world venture limited for an aggregate purchase price of million including transaction and closing costs  and recorded approximately million of goodwill as a result of the related fair value appraisals performed 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as discussed further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on goodwill and other intangibles 
the authoritative guidance requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life 
absent any prior indicators of impairment  we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each our fiscal year 
as of each december  and  we had million of goodwill  respectively 
as of each december  and  we had million and million net of amortization  respectively  of other identifiable intangible assets 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often if a trigger event occurs 
we amortize identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which typically is three years 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of the reporting unit 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 
we evaluate the recoverability of other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset a group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
as discussed further in note acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements  in we purchased certain assets of world venture limited for an aggregate purchase price of million including transaction and closing costs  and recorded approximately million of goodwill as a result of the related fair value appraisals performed 
throughout  we continually monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test 
for the periods presented  we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment test 
a decrease in the fair value of our reporting unit as of december  would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 
as of both december  and  we did not record any impairment charges on either our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
fair value measurement 
as discussed further in note  fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements  we determine fair value measurements of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on fair value measurements and disclosures 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of our marketable securities  specifically our debt instruments  can be difficult and subjective 
the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined  and the rapid changes occurring in the current financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time 
the fasb authoritative guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 

table of contents level instruments represent quoted prices in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets  issuer credit ratings  non binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data  model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities 
these level instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level instruments 
level instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
all of our marketable debt instruments classified as level are valued using a undiscounted cash flow analysis  non binding market consensus price and or a non binding broker quote  all of which we corroborate with unobservable data 
non binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers 
these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs  including non binding and binding broker quotes  observable market prices for identical and or similar securities  and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs  and to a lesser degree non observable market inputs 
adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non binding market consensus prices and non binding broker quotes  and classified as level  were not significant for each of the years ended december  and other than temporary impairment after determining the fair value of our available for sale debt instruments  gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in debt instruments  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be wrong  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities included million at par value of available for sale auction rate securities  and recognized  cumulatively in other than temporary impairments on our available for sale auction rate securities 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities included million at par value of available for sale auction rate securities and we did not recognize any other than temporary impairments on our available for sale auction rate securities
