company overview we were incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada and  along with our wholly owned subsidiaries  are headquartered in harbin  china 
we design  develop  manufacture  supply  and service a wide range of electric motors  with a focus on innovation  creativity  and value added products 
our major product lines include linear motors  specialty micro motors  and industrial rotary motors 
our products are purchased by a broad range of customers including those customers in the energy industry  factory automation  food processing  packaging industries  power generation systems  and mass transportation and freight transportation systems  petrochemical  metallurgical  mining  textile  and agricultural industries 
we supply domestic china and other international markets 
we operate four major manufacturing facilities in china  covering approximately  meters of land  and have an employee base of approximately engineers  production technicians and other employees 
we are subject to risks common to companies operating in china  including risks inherent in our distribution and commercialization efforts  uncertainty of foreign regulatory and marketing approvals and laws  reliance on key customers  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital and retention of key employees 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
executive summary harbin electric performed well in despite weak economic conditions early on 
this was also a year of significant strategic  operational and financial accomplishments as we further strengthened our leadership position in the electric motor industry in china 
faster economic growth in the second half of the year fueled by the massive government stimulus program and continued industrialization created a positive environment for our business 
the company achieved total revenues of million in  an increase compared with million in net income attributable to controlling interest totaled million per diluted share in  which included million charges related to non recurring and non cash items 
excluding these non recurring and non cash items  on a comparable basis  the adjusted net income attributable to controlling interest totaled million per diluted share  compared with net income of million per diluted share in the successful acquisition and integration of xi an tech full simo in october contributed million to total revenues and million to net income attributable to controlling interest 
on the financial front  we raised additional equity capital which allowed us to repay a significant portion of our existing indebtedness  completed the acquisition of xi an simo  and maintained a strong balance sheet as we continue to implement our growth strategy 
the company generated a total of million cash flow from operations in as begins  we expect to move the company forward to a sustained profitability by leveraging our solid financial position and a promising portfolio of products 
although the first quarter is traditionally slower with the long chinese new year holiday  we do not expect this seasonality to impact our business significantly compared to the fourth quarter 
we also expect that the chinese government s commitment to sustainable economic growth and the accelerated industrialization and urbanization of china will continue to drive our business and support our long term growth objectives 
in  we expect to continue the integration of xi an tech full simo  capture the synergies  advance r d  and further strengthen our competitive position in the industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
our critical accounting policies and estimates present an analysis of the uncertainties involved in applying a principle  while the accounting policies note to the financial statements note describe the method used to apply the accounting principle 
accounts receivable the company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable 
management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reverses 
the estimated loss rate is based on our historical loss experience and also contemplates current market conditions 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable  and known bad debts are written off against allowance for doubtful accounts when identified 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value  as determined on a first in  first out basis  using the weighted average method 
management compares the cost of inventory with the market value and an allowance is made for writing down the inventory to its market value  if lower than cost 
on an ongoing basis  inventories are reviewed for potential write down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions 
when inventory is written down to the lower of cost or market  it is not marked up subsequently based on changes in underlying facts and circumstances 
inventory is composed of raw material for manufacturing electrical motors  work in process and finished goods within the company s warehouse premise or consigned at a customer site 
inventory levels are maintained based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can result in excess and or obsolete inventories 
to the extent we increase our reserves for future periods  operating income will be reduced 
because most of our products are customized and unique to a particular customer  there is a risk that we will forecast inventory needs incorrectly and purchase or produce excess inventory 
as a result  actual demand may differ from forecasts  and such differences  if not managed  may have a material adverse effect on future results of operations due to required write offs of excess or obsolete inventory 
to mitigate such exposure  sometimes we require a binding purchase order or a signed agreement by our customers agreeing to pay for and take possession of finished goods inventory parts for the duration of the agreement 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the delivery is completed  no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured 
for products that are required to be examined by customers  sales revenue is recognized after the customer examination is passed 
payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as customer deposits 
in addition  revenue recognition could be negatively impacted by returns 
for our linear motor and specialty micro motor businesses  our products are custom products which are customer specific  and no returns are allowed 
we warrant our product for repair  only in the event of defects for two years from the date of shipment 
we charge such costs to cost of goods sold 
for our industrial rotary motor business  our products are standardized products and returns are allowed within three days upon receipt of products by customers 
we provide product warranty for repair one year from the date of shipment 
historically  the returns and defects have not been material 
should returns increase in the future it would be necessary to adjust the estimates  in which case recognition of revenues could be delayed 
stock based compensation we are required to estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant 
the value of the award is principally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant or assumption using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable 
the black scholes model considers  among other factors  the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights on a quarterly basis 
the fair values generated by the black scholes model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards  as it does not consider other factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
the company is required to measure the cost of the equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably determinable 
the value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earlier of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services 
stock compensation expense is recognized based on awards expected to vest 
gaap requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods  if necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
there were no estimated forfeitures as the company has a short history of issuing options 
derivative financial instruments the company used a cross currency interest rate swap to hedge its exposure under the notes 
the derivative is initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and subsequently re measured at fair value each reporting period 
changes in the fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  to the extent they qualify for hedge accounting  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes  changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments not qualifying as hedges are reported in income 
at the inception of a hedge transaction  the company documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes linking all derivatives designated to specific firm commitments of forecast transactions 
the company also documents its assessment  both at inception and on an ongoing basis  of whether the derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
the company terminated the cross currency interest rate swap agreement during the third quarter of therefore  this derivative financial instrument is no longer recognized in the quarterly financial statements as a liability beginning in the third quarter of fair value of financial instruments on january   the company adopted fasb s accounting standard related to fair value measurements and began recording financial assets and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
on january  the company began recording non recurring financial as well as all non financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement under the same principles 
these fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels 
adoption of new accounting standards effective january   a total of  warrants previously treated as equity pursuant to the derivative treatment exemption are no longer afforded equity treatment because the strike price of the warrants is denominated in us dollar  a currency other than the company s functional currency  the chinese renminbi 
as a result  the warrants are not considered indexed to the company s own stock  and as such  all future changes in the fair value of the warrants outstanding will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expired 
as such  effective january   the company reclassified the fair value of these warrants from equity to liability  as if these warrants were treated as a derivative liability since their issuance in august on january   the company reclassified from additional paid in capital  as a cumulative effect adjustment  million to beginning retained earnings and million to warrant liabilities to recognize the fair value of such warrants 
as of december   the company has  warrants outstanding 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants was million 
the company recognized a total of million loss from the change in fair value of the warrants for the year ended december  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value its options and warrants  and considering certain key input  including the trading price on reporting date  volatility of its stock  conversion price  remaining term of the warrants  dividend rate  and the risk free interest rate for the warrant life 
recently adopted accounting standards in january  the fasb s accounting standard regarding other investments providing additional guidance which amended the impairment model to remove the exclusive reliance on market participant estimates of future cash flows used in determining fair value 
changing the cash flows used to analyze other than temporary impairment from the market participant view to a holder s estimate of whether there has been a probable adverse change in estimated cash flows allows companies to apply reasonable judgment in assessing whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb s accounting standard regarding fair value measurements and disclosures providing additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly for fair value measurements

this guidance provides increased disclosure about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold and also requires increased and more frequent disclosures regarding expected cash flows  credit losses  and an aging of securities with unrealized losses 
although this guidance does not result in a change in the carrying amount of debt securities  it does require that the portion of an other than temporary impairment not related to a credit loss for a held to maturity security be recognized in a new category of other comprehensive income and be amortized over the remaining life of the debt security as an increase in the carrying value of the security 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december   total revenues were million  compared with million in  reflecting an growth year over year 
strong sales growth resulted from the acquisition of xi an tech full simo  which contributed million to total sales  as well as higher sales across all product lines 
by product line  linear motor sales were up from primarily due to higher oil pumps sales units in compared to units in and new sales from our linear motor propulsion systems developed for coal transportation trains million  as the company started to deliver the products during the th quarter 
this was somewhat offset by declines in other linear motors and in export sales 
sales of specialty micro motors were up from sales of industrial rotary motors increased from million to million including the contribution from the new acquisition 
international sales totaled million in  compared with million in the following table sets forth the amounts and the percentage relationship to revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and year ended december  variance amount revenues gross profit gross profit margin operating income operating margin net income attributable to controlling interest net profit margin income per share attributable to controlling interest basic diluted the following table presents the revenue contribution by percentage by each of our product line in versus percent of total revenues product line linear motors and related systems specialty micro motors rotary motors weihai xi an others total net income the company recorded a net income available to controlling interest of million  or per diluted share  which included special non cash and non recurring items totaling a net loss of million or per diluted share 
this compared with a net income of million  or per diluted share in total weighted average diluted share count at the end of was million compared to million at the end of the increase was mainly due to the million common shares issued in august in an equity financing  which resulted in some earnings dilution 
the management of harbin electric uses non gaap adjusted net earnings to measure the performance of the company s business internally by excluding non recurring items as well as special non cash charges 
the company s management believes that these non gaap adjusted financial measures allow the management to focus on managing business operating performance because these measures reflect the essential operating activities of harbin electric and provide a consistent method of comparison to historical periods 
the company believes that providing the non gaap measures that management uses internally to its investors is useful to investors for a number of reasons 
the non gaap measures provide a consistent basis for investors to understand harbin electric s financial performance in comparison to historical periods without variation of non recurring items and non operating related charges 
in addition  it allows investors to evaluate the company s performance using the same methodology and information as that used by the management 
non gaap measures are subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all of the expenses included under gaap and because they involve the exercise of judgment of which charges are excluded from the non gaap financial measure 
however  the management of harbin electric compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded 
the following table provides the non gaap financial measure and a reconciliation of the non gaap measure to the gaap net income 
net income attributable to controlling interest deduct other income government grant gain on debt repurchase add back amortization associated with debt repurchase loss on cross currency swap settlement change in fair value of warrant adjusted net income attributable to controlling interest diluted eps deduct other income government grant gain on debt repurchase add back amortization associated with debt repurchase loss on cross currency swap settlement change in fair value of warrant adjusted diluted eps attributable to controlling interest the non recurring and non cash items in included the second quarter had million rmb million government grant  which was awarded in june to the company s subsidiary htfe by the harbin municipal government to support the company s subway train project that qualifies as engaging in china s advanced industrialization  during the third quarter  the company repurchased million notes at a discount of and the outstanding million notes at a discount of  which resulted in a total gain of million

for comparison  total sales in consisted of from linear motors and the integrated application systems  from automobile specialty micro motors  and from controllers  armatures and other special motors 
the year over year sales growth was primarily attributable to the million sales from our industrial rotary motor business acquired in july higher sales from the other two core product lines also contributed significantly to the sales growth  with linear motor sales up and automobile specialty micro motor sales up year over year

this was million higher in than in  due principally to higher sales from existing products and newly added sales from acquisition 
the overall gross profit margin was in compared to in the decline in gross profit margin is primarily driven by changes in product mix where sales contribution from our lower margin products including industrial rotary motors and auto specialty micro motors increased more 
the gross margin for industrial rotary motor products was negatively impacted by higher raw material prices in compared to excluding the acquisition  the average gross profit margin was for operating expenses selling  general and administrative expense sg a of million in was higher than the million in  reflecting higher costs associated with increased sales activities such as shipping and handling costs and the addition of administrative costs from the newly acquired company weihai tech full

the income tax provision was million in versus none in the income tax that harbin tech full began to pay on earnings starting on january  has resulted in a reduction in our growth of net earnings compared to previous periods 
liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in the company s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow  which is strongly dependent on the demand for our products 
this is supplemented by our financing activities in the capital markets including potentially debt and equity  which supports major acquisitions and capital investments for business growth 
our liquidity position remains adequate  with million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was mainly driven by cash generated from operations  cash proceeds from the conversion of outstanding warrants and option exercise  and cash proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock at per share in a public offering during the third quarter

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to a variety of global market risks  including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures are managed  in part  with the use of a financial derivative 
the company uses financial derivatives only to hedge exposures in the ordinary course of business and does not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign exchange risk we currently conduct substantially all of our operations through our prc subsidiaries 
the functional currency of our prc subsidiaries is the chinese rmb 
the financial statements of our chinese subsidiary are translated to united states dollars using year end exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and average exchange rates as to revenues  expenses  and cash flows 
capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transaction occurred 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity 
transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
as the majority of our net revenue  of consolidated costs and expenses  and substantially all of our assets are denominated in rmb  any significant revaluation of the rmb may materially and adversely affect our cash flows  revenues and financial condition 
for example  if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings  and assets  as expressed in our us dollar financial statements could decline 
in addition  if we decide to convert our rmb into us dollars for the purpose of making payments for business purposes  the us dollar equivalent of the rmb we convert would be reduced 
on the other hand  to the extent that we need to convert us dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into rmb for our operations  appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar could reduce the amount of the us dollars available 
in addition  the appreciation of the rmb could make our customers products more expensive to purchase  because some of our customers are involved in the export of goods  which may have an adverse impact on their sales 
a decrease in sales by our customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
the local currencies in the countries in which we sell our products may fluctuate in value in relation to other currencies 
such fluctuations may affect the costs of our products sold and the value of our local currency profits 
while we are not conducting any meaningful operations in countries other than china at the present time  we may expand to other countries and may then have an increased risk of exposure of our business to currency fluctuation 
the prc government imposes control over the conversion of rmb  into foreign currencies 
under the current unified floating exchange rate system  the people s bank of china publishes an exchange rate  which we refer to as the pboc exchange rate  based on the previous day s dealings in the inter bank foreign exchange market 
financial institutions authorized to deal in foreign currency may enter into foreign exchange transactions at exchange rates within an authorized range above or below the pboc exchange rate according to market conditions 
pursuant to the foreign exchange control regulations of the prc issued by the state council which came into effect on april   and the regulations on the administration of foreign exchange settlement  sale and payment of the prc which came into effect on july   regarding foreign exchange control  conversion of rmb into foreign exchange by foreign investment enterprises  or fies  for use on current account items  including the distribution of dividends and profits to foreign investors  is permissible 
fies are permitted to convert their after tax dividends and profits to foreign exchange and remit such foreign exchange to their foreign exchange bank accounts in china 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies for capital account items  including direct investment  loans  and security investment  is still under certain restrictions 
on january   the state council amended the foreign exchange control regulations and added  among other things  an important provision  which provides that the prc government shall not impose restrictions on recurring international payments and transfers under current account items 
enterprises in china  including fies  which require foreign exchange for transactions relating to current account items  if within a certain limited amount may  without approval of the state administration of foreign exchange  or safe  effect payment from their foreign exchange account or convert and pay at the designated foreign exchange banks by providing valid receipts and proofs 
convertibility of foreign exchange in respect of capital account items  such as direct investment and capital contribution  is still subject to certain restrictions  and prior approval from the safe or its relevant branches must be sought 
between and  the exchange rate for rmb against the us dollar remained relatively stable  most of the time in the region of approximately rmb to us 
however  in  the chinese government announced that it would begin pegging the exchange rate of the rmb against a number of currencies  rather than just the us dollar 
since a significant amount of our future revenues are expected to be denominated in rmb  any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in china to fund our business activities outside of china  if any  or expenditures denominated in foreign currencies  or our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that the prc regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of rmb with respect to foreign exchange transactions 
translation adjustments resulting from this process amounted to   and  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
the balance sheet amounts with the exception of equity at december  and were translated rmb to and rmb to  respectively 
the equity accounts were stated at their historical exchange rate 
the average translation rates applied to the revenues  expenses and cash flows statement amounts for the fiscal years ended december   and were rmb  rmb and rmb to  respectively 
simo motor was acquired in october  and the average translation rate applied to simo motor s statement of income and cash flow was rmb to 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the notes and notes  as described under liquidity and capital resources 
our future interest expense will fluctuate in line with any change in our borrowing rates and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
derivative instrument to mitigate our exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates fluctuation associated with the notes  in  the company entered a cross currency interest rate swap agreement  which was terminated in september  as described under liquidity and capital resources cross currency interest rate hedge 
inflation according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in consumer price index in china was   and in   and  respectively 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations in recent years 
concentration of credit risks the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents  for cash flow statement purposes 
cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with banks within the prc and banks in the united states 
certain financial instruments  which subject the company to concentration of credit risk  consist of cash 
the company maintains balances at financial institutions which  from time to time  may exceed federal deposit insurance corporation insured limits for the banks located in the unites states 
balances at financial institutions or state owned banks within the prc are not covered by insurance 
as of december  and  the company had deposits in excess of federally insured limits totaling  and  respectively 
the company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts
