item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company which develops and commercializes innovative products to help stimulate the body s natural tissue regenerative process 
we believe our protein therapeutic device combination products have the potential to significantly improve the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and conditions affecting bones  tendons  ligaments and cartilage 
our platform regenerative technology  which incorporates a potent version of one of the body s natural key stimulators of tissue repair  may offer physicians advanced biological solutions to actively stimulate tissue healing and regeneration 
we have already demonstrated that this technology is safe and effective in stimulating bone regeneration with the us and canadian regulatory approvals of our first periodontal product  gem s growth factor enhanced matrix gem s  and with the canadian regulatory approval of our first orthopedic product  augment tm bone graft augment 
we continue to focus on further developing this technology to stimulate tissue healing in orthopedic applications such as certain types of bone fractures or fusions of the bones in the foot and ankle to eliminate chronic pain from trauma or arthritis  and potentially sports injury and spine applications 
our current product candidates are designed to target a broad range of clinical indications in bone  ligament  tendon and cartilage repair 
our product candidates have been the subject of numerous orthopedic clinical studies that have been completed or are on going which seek to demonstrate the safety  clinical utility and or efficacy of the product candidates in our pipeline  including our lead orthopedic product candidate augment  a fully synthetic and off the shelf bone growth factor product for the treatment of bone defects and injuries 
augment is the subject of our north american pivotal phase iii randomized controlled trial  which compares augment to autograft for use in hindfoot and ankle fusion surgery 
this trial will be the primary data set used to support regulatory approval in the united states  the european union eu and australia 
in addition  we have pre clinical programs focused on the development of treatments for bone defects in the spine and various sports injury applications  including those requiring ligament  tendon and cartilage repair 
in the second quarter of  we submitted to the us food and drug administration fda both the pre clinical pharmacology toxicology and quality manufacturing modules of a modular pre market approval pma application for the marketing of augment in the united states 
a modular submission breaks the pma document into three sections or modules filed at different times that together become a complete application 
the modular approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any concerns noted by the fda earlier in the review process than would occur with a traditional pma application  and may ultimately shorten the review and approval timeline 
in october  we reported positive top line results from our north american augment pivotal trial 
the primary study goal of this clinical study was to establish non inferiority of augment compared to autograft 
autograft is the current standard of care but is limited in that it must be obtained and transplanted from another bone in the patient s body  often requiring a second surgical procedure 
the positive top line results of the study indicate that  with the use of augment  patients can expect a comparable treatment outcome while being spared the pain and potential morbidity associated with autograft bone harvesting and transplantation 
in february  we submitted the third pma module  which contains the week data from the north american augment pivotal trial  and completes our pma seeking fda approval of augment in the united states 
in november  we received approval from health canada of our device license application dla in canada for augment 
the product is approved for use as an alternative to autologous bone graft in the surgical treatment of foot and ankle fusions in canada 
based upon this approval  we initiated the commercial marketing of augment in canada in the beginning of through our exclusive distribution partner  joint solutions alliance corporation joint solutions 
during the first quarter of  our commercial activities in canada have focused on the support of joint solutions efforts to get augment onto the list of approved products at the key hospitals throughout canada 
every new product must be reviewed by individual hospital product evaluation committees  which act as the gatekeepers at the hospital purchasing level 
these committees look at the potential impact of a new product on patient care and on the budget in the specific therapeutic category related to that product 
this process can take several months 
we are currently 
table of contents working with joint solutions to progress augment through the appropriate committees at the key accounts that we believe present the best opportunities for the product 
our numerous clinical studies  including our augment studies  suggest that our platform technology may be effective in our target applications 
if successful  we expect these clinical studies should lead to regulatory approval of our regenerative product candidates in the united states  the eu and australia 
if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities  we believe that our product candidates may offer new  effective and less invasive treatment options in orthopedic  spine and sports related injuries to improve the quality of life for millions of patients suffering injuries or deterioration of bones  ligaments  tendons and cartilage 
according to the national bureau of economic research  the us economy entered into a recession in december although the us commerce department has reported economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of and many economists now believe that the recession has ended  the continuing economic uncertainty and the ensuing market instability have continued to impact our general business strategy  which may be adversely affected if the current economic conditions do not continue to improve 
for example  the economy may impact the demand for elective medical procedures that we are targeting with our product candidates  or may impact the pricing that we may set for our products  if approved 
however  since our anticipated product launch in the united states for our lead product candidate may be a year or more away  the impact of the economy on commercial opportunities for that product remains uncertain 
we have responded to the current economic conditions by investing our cash and cash equivalents and our investments conservatively  and by employing cost control measures to conserve cash and manage expenses  such as scaling back growth in staff  eliminating unnecessary expenditures and postponing certain program activities where appropriate 
in addition  to the extent possible given contractual commitments  in order to postpone major expenses we have postponed certain major equipment purchases and delivery and validation efforts for manufacturing equipment intended for our new manufacturing facility which we have leased in the same complex as our headquarters in franklin  tennessee 
if the economy continues to improve and as we near regulatory approval of augment in the united states  we anticipate that we will reassess certain of these measures and resume growth in staffing and certain program activities 
recent developments clinical trials product development updates augment tm bone graft north american augment pivotal study foot and ankle fusions in october  we announced positive top line results from our north american pivotal phase iii randomized  controlled trial comparing augment to autograft for use in hindfoot and ankle fusion surgery augment pivotal study 
the study goal was to establish non inferiority of augment compared to autograft  which has the limitation that it must be obtained and transplanted from another bone in the patient s body  often requiring a second surgical procedure 
these positive top line results indicate that  with the use of augment  patients can expect a treatment outcome comparable to autograft while being spared the pain and potential morbidity associated with traditional autograft bone harvesting and transplantation 
in february  we submitted to the fda the third pma module  which supplements the pre clinical pharmacology toxicology and quality manufacturing modules submitted in the second quarter of this third pma module contains the week data from the north american augment pivotal trial  and completes our pma seeking fda approval of augment in the united states 
in march  we announced additional data from our augment pivotal study at the annual meeting of the american academy of orthopedic surgeons aaos 
the lead investigator of the augment north american pivotal study  dr 
christopher digiovanni  presented additional data regarding the week results of the study 
these data are based on the modified intent to treat mitt patient population  which is the pre specified primary study population 
secondary clinical endpoints not previously reported included additional radiographic plain film union for two and three aspects  clinical clinical healing by joint  composite success  clinical success  therapeutic failure  functional sf  foot function index  aofas scores and patient indicated pain fusion site  weight bearing  graft harvest site evaluations 
out of a total of additional secondary clinical endpoints  met the test for non inferiority compared to autograft at a statistically significant level 
new data were also reported relating to the safety of augment compared to the 
table of contents autograft control 
the augment group exhibited a lower rate of serious treatment emergent adverse events  a lower rate of overall and surgery related complications  a lower rate of serious complications  fewer surgery related complications and a lower rate of infection when compared with the autograft group 
see business product development programs augment bone graft for more information and a tabular presentation of these clinical data 
our pma application is currently under review by the fda 
we expect that  in the second half of  an fda advisory committee  which is typically a panel of clinicians and statisticians  is likely to be convened to review the application and recommend to the fda whether  or upon what conditions  augment should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the advisory panel decision  but the fda often follows the panel s recommendation 
we anticipate that approval of augment in the united states will occur within six months after the panel meeting if the panel recommends approval and if the fda finds the pma information satisfactory 
eu augment trial foot and ankle fusions in may  we initiated a clinical study in the european union eu  to evaluate augment for the treatment of foot and ankle fusions 
in november  we completed enrollment with a total enrollment of patients 
this study is an open label trial  and will be used to support the safety of augment 
we are compiling the data from the study and we anticipate that the data from the study should be available around mid year we expect to submit the trial data  in conjunction with data from the north american pivotal trial  to the european medicines agency ema in the third quarter of canadian augment pilot and registration trial foot and ankle fusions in november  we announced that we received approval from health canada to begin the marketing of our lead orthopedic product  augment  as an alternative to the use of autograft in foot and ankle fusion indications in canada 
based upon health canada s approval  in december we shipped our first order of augment to our canadian distributor  joint solutions alliance corporation joint solutions  a sales and distribution company for orthopedic products headquartered in burlington  ontario  canada 
joint solutions is the exclusive distributor of our augment product in canada  and we have deployed clinical specialists in the canadian market  which is approximately the size of the us market  to work collaboratively with them 
the augment product was made available to customers in canada in january we are working with distributor personnel to gain product approval at individual institutions through review by the hospitals new product evaluation committees  a process that can take several months to complete 
australian therapeutic goods administration in february  we filed an application of conformity assessment with the australian therapeutic goods administration tga for augment 
this application seeks approval to market augment in australia as an alternative to autograft in the treatment of foot and ankle fusions 
the filing utilized the technical and clinical data that were provided to health canada in the recent dla and to the fda in the recent filing of the pma for augment in the united states 
the tga review is expected to take to months to complete  however  the timing of regulatory review can be uncertain and as a result we may be unable to obtain australian approval of augment in a timely manner  if at all 
looking forward to the successful completion of augment marketing approval  the company has established a relationship with an orthopedic distributor  surgical specialties pty ltd surgical specialties  in sydney  australia 
surgical specialties will be the exclusive distributor of augment and augment injectable in australia and new zealand 
augment tm injectable bone graft north american augment injectable pivotal study foot and ankle fusions 
we previously announced results from both the canadian augment injectable pilot trial and the eu augment injectable pilot trial  which provided us with sufficient evidence of augment injectable s safety and clinical utility to allow us to progress augment injectable forward in the development process 
accordingly  in we filed an investigational testing authorization augment injectable ita application with health canada and an investigational device exemptions augment injectable ide application with the fda 
health canada approved the augment injectable ita  and in october  we initiated patient enrollment in a north american pivotal study to assess the safety and efficacy of augment injectable as a substitute for autograft in foot and ankle fusion procedures augment injectable study 
this 
table of contents randomized  controlled study is intended to support the registration of augment injectable in canada and the united states 
the augment injectable study is designed to incorporate approximately patients  some of whom will be autograft patients that were enrolled in our north american augment pivotal study 
the augment injectable study protocol in canada is similar to the augment pivotal study protocol so certain control ie autograft patients enrolled in the augment pivotal study can be used to supplement the control group in the new study 
up to clinical centers in north america will be involved  with five sites that have already begun enrolling patients in canada 
we are finalizing the details of the protocol and the statistical plan of the augment injectable study with the fda and will not commence patient enrollment in the study in the united states until the details of the protocol and the statistical plan are complete 
we cannot be certain  however  whether the fda will approve the augment injectable ide or  if approved  that the approved protocol will permit the pooling of the study s patients with the patients that we are currently enrolling under the canadian augment injectable ita or with the control patients included in our augment pivotal study 
we expect to receive a final decision on our ide around mid year  and would anticipate initiating patient enrollment in the united states shortly thereafter  and completing patient enrollment within six months of initial enrollment 
sports medicine at the orthopedic research society meeting in march  we presented results of two pre clinical studies demonstrating that rhpdgf bb  in combination with tissue specific matrix materials  promotes healing in achilles and rotator cuff injuries in sheep models 
in addition  we also presented in vitro data supporting rhpdgf bb s ability to influence tenocytes 
based on these positive results  we intend to initiate a pilot clinical trial in sports medicine by the end of gemesis tm bone graft european medicines agency filing the ema previously determined that gemesis tm bone graft gemesis  formerly gem s  would be reviewed as a medicinal ie  a drug combination product  and not as a medical device product which is how the product was reviewed in the united states and canada 
accordingly  we filed a marketing authorization application maa for gemesis  but the ema rejected our application  due in part to the different clinical and quality requirements of a drug product in the eu compared to a medical device product in the united states 
we appealed that decision  but our appeal has been denied 
we are currently re evaluating our regulatory strategy for gemesis in the eu  and are considering seeking reclassification of gemesis from a medicinal to a medical device based on recent changes in the medical device directives mdd 
further  as part of our agreements with luitpold  we are entitled to receive a million milestone payment from luitpold upon eu regulatory approval of gemesis 
because of uncertainties in the review process  we have excluded this milestone payment from our financial guidance for recent developments other auction rate securities and note payable in december  we sold all of the remaining securities at issue in an arbitration proceeding which we had filed in february with the financial industry regulatory authority  inc finra asserting various claims relating to investments in certain auction rate securities made on our behalf 
in addition  following receipt of a payment in the amount of million from the respondent in the arbitration  we settled the arbitration claim and dismissed the case 
with the redemptions and sales of all our remaining ars investments during  we repaid in full the balance on our time promissory note note credit facility  under which we had borrowed million in october the original promissory note has been returned to us marked paid in full 
in addition  the issuer of the note has released us from the note  and has terminated our security and pledge agreement and securities account control agreement and terminated any ucc filings made with respect to the note and security agreements 

table of contents manufacturing and supply agreement in december  we amended and restated our manufacturing and supply agreement with novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc novartis for the supply of bulk rhpdgf bb 
the agreement strengthens our mutual exclusivity whereby novartis will manufacture rhpdgf bb exclusively for us for therapeutic applications covering bone  cartilage  tendon and ligaments 
patents in january  we announced that the european patent office epo intends to grant patent application no 
titled platelet derived growth factor compositions and methods of use thereof 
the allowed claims will cover compositions of recombinant human platelet derived growth factor rhpdgf combined with matrix materials having defined characteristics  which will cover our recombinant protein device combination product candidates  including augment and augment injectable  as well as gemesis  which we previously sold to luitpold pharmaceuticals  inc once issued  the new patent will provide protection against the marketing of similar or generic versions of augment  augment injectable  and gemesis in europe until financial overview since inception in  we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of capital stock including redeemable preferred stock  our initial public offering in may  our secondary public offering in february  a private placement in april and our rights offering in june  from the licensing and sale of our orofacial therapeutic business in january  and from research and development agreements  grants and product sales 
the proceeds from these activities are reflected in the balance of cash and investments totaling million as of december   which includes million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term and long term investments in us government sponsored enterprise gse securities and us treasury notes that are classified as available for sale 
during the year ended december   all of our investments in ars were redeemed or sold for total proceeds of million  including the december sale of our remaining ars investments for million 
in  we had determined that our ars investments had experienced an other than temporary impairment in fair value and we had estimated the fair value to be million  representing an impairment loss of million  as of december  the redemptions and sales of our ars investments during have resulted in a net realized gain of million recorded to earnings in our consolidated statement of operations as of december  in addition  we received a million payment from the settlement of an arbitration claim relating to the investments in ars made on our behalf 
as of december   we did not have any investments in ars 
in october  to address the liquidity issues experienced with these ars investments in the short term  we entered into a time promissory note note credit facility enabling us to borrow up to million with certain of our ars investments serving as collateral 
with the redemptions and sales of all our remaining ars investments during the year ended december   we have repaid in full the balance on the note and the original promissory note has been returned to us marked paid in full 
in addition  the issuer of the note has released us from the note  and has terminated our security and pledge agreement and securities account control agreement and terminated any ucc filings made with respect to the note and security agreements 
we continue to incur research and development expenses due to the substantial expansion of our internal research capabilities and the numbers of patients we have enrolled and expect to enroll in the clinical trials of augment  augment injectable and our other product candidates 
we will make determinations as to which product candidates to advance and how much funding to direct to each on an ongoing basis in response to their scientific and clinical success 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as a result of new and ongoing clinical trials and pre clinical studies of our product candidates in the united states  canada and the european union eu  as well as continuing expenses associated with regulatory filings 

table of contents the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the five years ended december  direct external costs represent significant expenses paid to third parties that specifically relate to the clinical development of augment  such as payments to contract research organizations  clinical investigators  manufacture of clinical material  consultants  contract manufacturing start up costs  manufacturing scale up costs  milestone payments and insurance premiums for clinical studies 
in addition  employee costs salaries  payroll taxes  benefits  and travel for employees of the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  clinical affairs  quality assurance  quality control and research and development are classified as research and development costs

since inception  we have incurred losses from operations each year 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  which includes a million net gain on the january sale of our orofacial therapeutic business 
although the size and timing of our future operating losses are subject to significant uncertainty  we expect that operating losses may continue over the next few years as we continue to fund our research and development activities and clinical trials and as we prepare for a future sales network to represent our products 
in november  we received approval of our dla in canada for use and marketing of augment in canada  however  we currently do not have an fda approved product in commercial ization in the united states 
the successful development of augment and our other product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development and approval of  or the period in which material net cash flows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  future clinical trial results  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the establishment of marketing  sales and distribution  the cost and timing associated with licensing  business relationships and similar arrangements  the cost and timing of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of augment and our other product candidates  the timing and results of our pre clinical research programs  and 
table of contents the effects of competing technologies and market developments  and the industry demand and patient wellness behavior as businesses and individuals suffer from the current economic downturn 
any failure to complete the development of augment or any of our other product candidates in a timely manner  or any failure to successfully market and commercialize augment or any of our other product candidates  could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some of the consequences of failing to do so  are set forth under item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  fair valuation of inventory  valuation of any losses on purchase commitments  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on authoritative literature and pronouncements  historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the results of our operations for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of the results of our operations for any other future period 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  research and development expense  inventory valuation  valuation of purchase commitments  accrued expenses and deferred liabilities  stock based compensation  income taxes and investments in marketable securities are significant and  therefore  important to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we follow the revenue recognition criteria outlined in asc  revenue recognition includes former staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
product sales revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer 
accordingly  up front  non refundable license fees under agreements where we have an ongoing research and development commitment are amortized  on a straight line basis  over the performance period 
revenues from milestones are only recognized upon achievement of the milestone criteria 
milestone payments received for sublicense fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the sublicense 
revenues received for ongoing research and development activities under collaborative agreements are recognized as these activities are performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are received from our sublicensor in arrears based on sales by the sublicensor 
we recognize royalty income when we receive the sales information from luitpold 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
revenue related to grant awards is deferred and recognized as related research and development performance occurs

in addition  employee costs salaries  payroll taxes  benefits  and travel for employees of the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  clinical affairs  quality assurance  quality control  and research and development departments are classified as research and development costs 
on january   we adopted emerging issues task force issue  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities now included in asc  research and development  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations as of and for the years ended december  and inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of our actual cost or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review existing inventory quantities  expiration dates of existing inventory  and inventory purchase commitments with suppliers to evaluate a provision for excess  expired  obsolete and scrapped inventory based primarily on our historical usage and anticipated future usage 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
inventory is carried at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and consists primarily of the purchase of raw materials  shipping costs associated with the transportation of raw materials to the contract manufacturer  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of filled periodontal cups and vials  kit packing fees  and quality control testing fees  less reserves for obsolescence  shrinkage  expired inventory and potential scrapping of product batches that may not be released for sale 
valuation of purchase commitments we have substantial firm purchase commitments with our suppliers related to our future inventory needs 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the need for any provision for future losses associated with these future purchase commitments in accordance with asc  inventory and asc  commitments formerly accounting research bulletin arb no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
as of december   no reserves have been recorded associated with these future purchase commitments 
accrued expenses and deferred liabilities as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate expenses that we have incurred for which we have not been invoiced 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed by third parties and the associated cost incurred for such services where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs 
examples of expenses for which we accrue based on estimates include milestones payable  salaries and wages  unpaid vacation and sick pay  fees for services  such as those provided by clinical research and data management organizations  investigators and fees owed to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of clinical trial materials 
in connection with such service fees  these estimates are most affected by management s projections of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under estimate or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which certain services commence  the 
table of contents level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
management makes these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to it at the time and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation during  our board of directors approved the adoption of the long term stock incentive plan the option plan 
the option plan provides that stock options  other equity interests or equity based incentives in our company may be granted to key personnel at an exercise price determined by our compensation committee  at the time the option is granted  taking into account the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
the maximum term of any option granted pursuant to the option plan is ten years from the date of grant 
the stock options we granted to our employees are structured to qualify as incentive stock options isos 
under current tax regulations  we do not receive a tax deduction for the issuance  exercise or disposition of isos if the employee meets specific holding requirements 
if the employee does not meet the holding requirements  a disqualifying disposition occurs  at which time we will receive a tax deduction 
we do not record tax benefits related to isos unless and until a disqualifying disposition occurs 
in the event of a disqualifying disposition  the entire tax benefit is recorded as a reduction of income tax expense 
we have not recognized any income tax benefit for share based compensation arrangements due to the fact that we do not believe that we will recognize any deferred tax assets from such compensation cost recognized in the current period 
effective january   we adopted asc  equity based payments to non employees  and asc  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method of transition 
under that transition method  compensation costs recognized in the years ended december   and include the costs for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc and asc in accordance with asc and asc  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions amortized to expense over the options vesting periods for the year ended december  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock ranged from to  forfeiture rate of and weighted average expected life of the option of years 
since the trading market for our common stock has a limited history  the expected volatility rates are based on historical data from three companies similar in size and value to our company 
the expected terms of options granted represent the period of time that options granted are estimated to be outstanding and are derived from the contractual terms of the options granted 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
we amortize the fair value of each option over each option s vesting period 
during the year ended december   we granted stock options to our employees  members of the board of directors and consultants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of 
our net loss for the years ended december   and includes compensation costs of million  million and million  respectively  related to our stock based compensation arrangements 
no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangement is included in our net losses 
income taxes we account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method prescribed by the provisions of asc  income taxes formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided for the deferred tax assets related to future years  including loss carryforwards  if there is not sufficient evidence to indicate that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax asset in future years 

table of contents effective january   we adopted a provision asc  income taxes formerly financial accounting standards board fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to account for uncertain tax positions 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation prescribes that we should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of adopting asc  we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities  or any associated amounts for interest and penalties 
as a result  there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations as of and for the years ended december   and investments effective january   we adopted asc  fair value measurements formerly sfas no

realized gains and losses and declines in market value judged to be other than temporary on investments in marketable securities are included in investment loss income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of ars investments sold were based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on ars investments were included in investment loss income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in  we had determined that these ars investments had experienced an other than temporary impairment in fair value  and therefore had recorded a million impairment loss 
however  during the twelve months ended december   all of our ars investments were sold at a discount or redeemed by the issuers at par  resulting in total cash proceeds of million and a million realized gain recorded in earnings on our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we received a million payment from the settlement of an arbitration claim relating to the investments in ars made on our behalf 
as of december   we did not have any investments in ars

results of operations years ended december  and net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the net loss in included a million realized gain and a million settlement payment related to our investments in ars 
the net loss in included a million gain on the disposal of our orofacial therapeutic business  offset in part by a million impairment loss on our ars investments 
we anticipate that our operating losses  which are only partially offset by sales  revenues from royalty income  sublicense fee income and investment income  may continue over the next few years as we continue to fund our research and development activities and clinical trials and as we prepare for a future sales network to represent our products

as a result of the sale  no product sales revenues  nor cost of sales  resulting from sales of gem s have been recorded in and in november  we received approval from health canada for the marketing and commercialization of augment in canada 
based upon this approval  we shipped our first order of augment to our canadian distributor  joint solutions alliance corporation  a sales and distribution company for orthopedic products headquartered in burlington  ontario  canada 
accordingly  we recorded million in revenue from product sales of augment in december cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december  was minimal 
no cost of sales was incurred in cost of sales is comprised of the following costs raw materials used in the production and manufacturing of vials and cups  testing fees for the vials and cups  labeling materials for the finished kits  packaging materials for inclusion in the finished kit  kit packing costs and scrap incurred during the production process 
the cost of sales will vary in direct correlation to the volume of product sales of augment kits 
certain raw materials were purchased in prior years before the phase iii clinical trials were completed 
as a result  this pre launch inventory was expensed 
therefore  we expect that the gross profit margins will decrease as we continue to replenish our raw materials and includes those production costs in the cost of sales 
ars investments in  we had determined that our ars investments had experienced an other than temporary impairment in fair value  and therefore had recorded a million impairment loss on our consolidated statement of operations in in  all of our ars investments were sold at a discount or redeemed by the issuers at par  resulting in total cash proceeds of million and a million realized gain recorded to investment income on our consolidated statement of operations in in addition  we received a million payment from the settlement of an arbitration claim relating to the investments in ars made on our behalf 
this million settlement payment is recorded as a gain on arbitration settlement and is reflected on our consolidated statement of operations in as of december   we did not have any remaining investments in ars 
royalty and sublicense fee income royalty income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in royalty income is earned and received based on luitpold s sale of the gem s product during the year 
in  luitpold s net sales of gem s were million  compared to million in royalty income decreased in compared to primarily due to the reimbursement received in for minimum royalty expenses that are contractually paid by us to independent third parties 
there was no minimum royalty expense or reimbursement in in addition  we believe that the current economic downturn may have negatively impacted the demand for elective dental procedures  such as regenerative procedures using gem s  potentially resulting in decreased sales compared to the prior year 
also  under the terms of the january sale of our orofacial therapeutic business discussed above  we expect to receive ongoing royalty payments from luitpold based on net sales of gem s 
sublicense fee income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in sublicense fee income is based on certain milestone payments previously received from luitpold 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the same period in the million decrease resulted in part from our focus on controlling costs in  a decrease of million in contract manufacturing expenses as certain clinical trials came to a close in and clinical supplies were no longer needed  and since costs included initial start up costs of clinical trials  a decrease of million in professional services for clinical costs as certain orthopedic clinical trials came to a close in  a decrease of million in professional services expenses for validation consulting  regulatory and outside r d costs  a decrease of million in salaries  payroll taxes  benefits  insurance  recruiting and relocation expenses  and general activities of the r d programs 
we expect that research and development expenses will start to increase over the next few months as a result of new and ongoing clinical trials of augment and our other product candidates in the united states  canada  and the eu  as well as continuing expenses associated with pre clinical studies and regulatory filings 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the same period in the million increase resulted in part from an increase of million in salaries  benefits  payroll taxes  and stock compensation costs  an increase of million in fees paid to the board of directors resulting from the april approval of an increase in retainers and meeting fee payments  an increase of million in professional fees primarily due to legal fees incurred for ongoing patent licensing agreements and the arbitration proceedings related to our ars investments  a decrease of million in utilities  rent and common area maintenance as a result of our focus on controlling costs in  and  a decrease of million in royalty expense as a result of lower sales of gems by luitpold as well as minimum royalty expense payments required in that were not required in we have kept our organizational growth to a minimum as we are continuously monitoring expenses and have implemented cash conservation measures wherever possible 
depreciation and capital lease amortization depreciation and capital lease amortization for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in patent license fee amortization patent license fee amortization for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in ongoing amortization expense is attributable to the capitalization of patent license fees amounting to a cumulative million as of december  interest and investment income total net interest and investment income for the year ended december  was million  compared to a net interest and investment loss of million for the same period in the sales and redemptions of certain ars investments resulted in a net realized gain on investments of million recorded to investment income

excluding this loss  total net interest and investment income was million for the year ended december  interest rates earned on our cash and money market accounts ranged from to during the year ended december   which is a significant decrease from the same period in when interest rates ranged from to 
interest expense on our note payable for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in the increase in is because we held the note for only a portion of since the note was initially incurred in october the note was paid in full in december provision for income taxes at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that will begin to expire in state net operating loss carryforwards at december  totaled million and will expire between and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards could be limited 
our ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future federal income tax liabilities could be subject to annual limitations 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which net operating loss carryforwards may be applied against future taxable income and tax liabilities  we may not be able to take advantage of our net operating loss for federal income tax purposes

stock compensation expense was million in the general and administrative functions for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this increase was due to the expense related to a total of  new stock options awarded in at a weighted average exercise price of per share

all of the shares of common stock were sold at a price of per share 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions of million million paid by us and million paid by the selling stockholders and other offering expenses of approximately million paid by us in connection with the offering  the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million to us and million to the selling stockholders 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders

under our agreement with luitpold  upon approval of gem s now known as gemesis tm in europe in the eu  we are entitled to receive a million milestone payment from luitpold 
refer to milestone payments discussed below for more information regarding this potential milestone payment 
cash and cash equivalents and investments as of december   the remaining net proceeds from our capital offerings and sale of gem s have been invested conservatively in cash and cash equivalents and in short term and long term investments in gse securities and us treasury notes 

table of contents at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents held in three financial institutions 
our excess cash reserves are invested in overnight sweep accounts  operating accounts and money market accounts 
in addition to the balance of cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had million in short term investments classified as available for sale consisting of gse securities totaling million and us treasury notes totaling million 
also at december   we had million in long term investments in gse securities 
the gse securities have maturity dates ranging from january through march the us treasury notes have maturity dates ranging from march to august during and  we had investments in certain ars investments that were classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
we had determined that these ars investments had experienced an other than temporary impairment in fair value  and therefore had recorded a million impairment loss recorded to earnings as reflected on our consolidated statement of operations as of december  however  during  all of our ars investments were sold at a discount or redeemed by the issuers at par  resulting in total cash proceeds of million and a million realized gain recorded to earnings on our consolidated statement of operations as of december  in addition  in december  we received a million payment from the settlement of an arbitration claim relating to the investments in ars made on our behalf 
as of december   we did not have any investments in ars 
in october  to address the liquidity issues experienced with these ars investments in the short term  we entered into a time promissory note note credit facility enabling us to borrow up to million with certain of our ars investments serving as collateral 
we granted the issuer of the note a first priority security interest in certain of our ars investments having a total combined par value of million as collateral 
under the terms of the note  we were required to make monthly interest payments during the two year term of the note and all outstanding principal amounts were to be due and payable in full on the maturity date in october we had an election to pay back the full principal amount prior to the maturity date with no penalty 
absent our default or a sale of part of the collateral ars investments  the issuer of the note had no ability to withdraw  reduce or change the terms of the note 
under the terms of the note  and at our option  the interest rate was based on either libor plus or the note issuer s prime rate minus 
the note also provided that in the event that the issuer of the note later offers an ars lending program or settlement loan program to institutional clients that included either a lower interest rate or permitted borrowing of more than of the par value of the collateral securities  then the terms of our note and any existing loans issued under the note would have modified to include the lower interest rate or higher borrowing base 
with the redemptions and sales of all our remaining ars investments during the year ended december   we have repaid in full the balance on the note and the original promissory note has been returned to us marked paid in full 
in addition  the issuer of the note has released us from the note  and has terminated our security and pledge agreement and securities account control agreement and terminated any ucc filings made with respect to the note and security agreements 
cash flows for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  primarily consisting of salaries  clinical trials  research and development activities and general corporate operations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and included the time based payments received in from the disposal of our orofacial therapeutic business  and the net sales and redemptions of our investments in ars  offset by capitalized patent costs and engineering design and planning costs for the new manufacturing facility at our corporate headquarters 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million repayment of our october note  offset by million in net proceeds from stock offerings in and million in net proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock compensation plans 
we believe that the december  balance of our cash and investments  which includes million in net proceeds from stock offerings in and million in milestone payments received from luitpold in  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements at least through the middle of 
table of contents we expect to devote substantial resources to continue our research and development efforts  including clinical trials 
clinical study costs are comprised of payments for work performed by contract research organizations  universities and hospitals 
because of the significant time it will take for augment or our other product candidates to complete the clinical trial process  obtain approval from regulatory authorities and successfully commercialize our products  we may require substantial additional capital resources 
we may raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaborations or other means 
we may attempt to raise additional capital due to favorable market conditions or other strategic considerations even if we have sufficient funds for planned operations 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuance of equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution  and debt financings  if available  may involve restrictive covenants or may otherwise constrain our financial flexibility 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our intellectual property or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
in addition  payments made by potential collaborators or licensors generally will depend upon our achievement of negotiated development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve these milestones may harm our future capital position 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
capital may become difficult or impossible to obtain due to poor market or other conditions outside of our control 
if at any time sufficient capital is not available  either through existing capital resources or through raising additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our research  pre clinical or clinical programs 
seasonality we have determined that the impact on seasonality on our results of operations is minimal  however  fluctuations in product sales revenues are the result of our evolving product commercialization efforts 
segment information we have determined that we are principally engaged in one operating segment 
our product development efforts are primarily in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases  including orthopedic  spine and sports injury applications for the repair and regeneration of orthopedic tissues  including bone  cartilage  ligaments and tendons

table of contents our first product  gem s  received approval from the fda in november as a result of the fda approval  we received a million milestone payment from luitpold in december in december  we received a million milestone payment from luitpold upon the second anniversary of the fda approval 
also as a result of the fda approval  we were required to make milestone payments of million to novartis and a total of million to patent licensors 
the patent license fees were paid to our licensors as a result of fda approval and receipt of the milestone payments from luitpold upon fda approval  and were capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the patents 
under our agreements with luitpold  upon approval of gemesis in the eu  we are entitled to receive a million milestone payment from luitpold  who now owns the gem s and gemesis products  and markets gem s through its osteohealth company 
the european medicines agency ema previously determined that gemesis would be reviewed as a medicinal ie  a drug combination product  and not as a medical device product which is how the product was reviewed in the united states and canada 
accordingly  we filed a marketing authorization application maa for gemesis  but the ema rejected our application  due in part to the different clinical and quality requirements of a drug product in the eu compared to a medical device product in the united states 
we appealed that decision  but our appeal has been denied 
we are currently re evaluating our regulatory strategy for gemesis in the eu  and are considering seeking reclassification of gemesis from a medicinal to a medical device based on recent changes in the medical device directives mdd 
because of uncertainties in the review process  we have excluded this milestone payment from our financial guidance for in addition  we received an additional million in time based payments in cash in  and we expect to receive ongoing royalty payments based on net sales of gem s

fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
the asc changes existing guidance for determining whether impairment of debt securities is other than temporary 
the asc requires other than temporary impairment to be separated into the amount representing the decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from a security referred to as credit losses  which is recognized in earnings  and the amount related to other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the non credit loss component of the impairment can only be classified in other comprehensive income if the holder of the security concludes that it does not intend to sell the security and that it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before the security recovers its value 
if these two conditions are not met  the non credit loss component of the impairment must also be recognized in earnings 
upon adoption of the asc  the entity is required to record a cumulative effect adjustment  as of the beginning of the period of adoption  to reclassify the non credit loss component of previously recognized other than temporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income

effects of inflation because our assets are  to an extent  liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects such expenses as employee compensation  office space leasing costs and research and development charges  which may not be readily recoverable during the period of time that we are bringing the product candidates to market 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the market  it may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in certain businesses

we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense
