this presentation of average prices with derivatives is a means by which to reflect the actual cash performance of our commodity derivatives for the respective periods and presents oil and natural gas prices with derivatives in a manner consistent with the presentation generally used by the investment community 
productive wells the following table sets forth the number of productive oil and natural gas wells on our properties at december  gross productive wells net productive wells natural natural oil gas total oil gas total core operating areas new mexico permian texas permian emerging plays lower abo bakken three forks other total marketing arrangements general 
we market our crude oil and natural gas in accordance with standard energy practices utilizing certain of our employees and external consultants  in each case in consultation with our products group  asset managers and our corporate reservoir engineers 
the marketing effort is coordinated with our operations group as it relates to the planning and preparation of future drilling programs so that available markets can be assessed and 
table of contents secured 
this planning also involves the coordination of procuring the physical facilities necessary to connect new producing wells as efficiently as possible upon their completion 
oil 
we do not refine or process the crude oil we produce 
a significant portion of our crude oil is connected directly to pipelines via gathering facilities in the respective field locations throughout southeast new mexico  while a significant portion of our production in west texas is transported by truck 
the oil is then delivered either to hub facilities located in midland  texas or cushing  oklahoma or to third party refineries located in southeast new mexico and the panhandle and gulf coast area of texas  with the majority of our crude oil going to a refinery in southeast new mexico 
this oil is also transported to the hub facilities and refineries mentioned above 
we sell the majority of the oil we produce under contracts using market based pricing 
this price is then adjusted for differentials based upon delivery location and oil quality 
natural gas 
we consider all natural gas gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production and evaluate market options to obtain the best price reasonably available under the circumstances 
we sell the majority of our natural gas under individually negotiated natural gas purchase contracts using market based pricing 
the majority of our natural gas is subject to term agreements that extend at least three years from the date of the subject contract 
the majority of the natural gas we sell is casinghead gas sold at the lease under a percentage of proceeds processing contract 
the purchaser gathers our casinghead natural gas in the field where produced and transports it via pipeline to a natural gas processing plant where the liquid products are extracted 
the remaining natural gas product is residue gas  or dry gas  which is gathered at the wellhead and delivered into the purchaser s residue or mainline transportation system 
under our percentage of proceeds contract  we receive a percentage of the value for the extracted liquids and the residue gas 
each of the liquid products has its own individual market and is therefore priced separately 
in many cases  the natural gas gathering and transportation is performed by a third party gathering company which transports the production from the production location to the purchaser s mainline 
the majority of our dry gas and residue gas is subject to term agreements that extend at least three years from the date of the subject contract 
our principal customers we sell our oil and natural gas production principally to marketers and other purchasers that have access to pipeline facilities 
in areas where there is no practical access to pipelines  oil is transported to storage facilities by trucks owned or otherwise arranged by the marketers or purchasers 
our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control  the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted 
for  revenues from oil and natural gas sales to navajo refining company  lp and dcp midstream  lp accounted for approximately percent and approximately percent  respectively  of our total operating revenues 
while the loss of either of these purchasers may result in a temporary interruption in sales of  or a lower price for  our production  we believe that the loss of either of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations  as there are alternative purchasers in our producing regions 
competition the oil and natural gas industry in the regions in which we operate is highly competitive 
we encounter strong competition from numerous parties  ranging generally from small independent producers to major integrated companies 
we primarily encounter significant competition in acquiring properties  contracting for drilling and workover equipment and securing trained personnel 
many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours 
as a result  our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable properties  or to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit 
in addition to the competition for drilling and workover equipment we are also affected by the availability of related equipment 
the oil and natural gas industry periodically experiences shortages of drilling and workover rigs  equipment  pipe  materials and personnel  which can delay developmental drilling  workover and exploration 
table of contents activities and cause significant price increases 
the past shortages of personnel made it difficult to attract and retain personnel with experience in the oil and natural gas industry and caused us to increase our general and administrative budget 
we are unable to predict the timing or duration of any such shortages 
competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties  undeveloped leases and drilling rights 
although we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and submit bids as part of our growth strategy  we do not have any current agreements  understandings or arrangements with respect to any material acquisition 
applicable laws and regulations regulation of the oil and natural gas industry regulation of transportation of oil 
sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices 
nevertheless  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation 
the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act 
in general  interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost based  although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances 
effective january   the ferc implemented regulations establishing an indexing system that permits a pipeline  subject to limited challenges  to annually increase or decrease its transportation rates due to inflationary changes in costs using a ferc approved index 
on march   ferc issued a decision setting the index for the period july  through july at the producer price index for finished goods the ppi fg plus percent 
the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation  and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates  varies from state to state 
insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers  we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors 
further  interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non discriminatory basis at posted tariff rates 
when oil pipelines operate at full capacity  access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines published tariffs 
accordingly  we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors 
regulation of transportation and sale of natural gas 
historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of the natural gas act  the natural gas policy act of the natural gas policy act and regulations issued under those acts by the ferc 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold 
while sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future  and market participants are prohibited from engaging in market manipulation 
deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the natural gas policy act 
in  congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act which removed all natural gas act and natural gas policy act price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  the ferc regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions  which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas 
since  the ferc has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non discriminatory basis 
the ferc has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by  among other things  unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services 
beginning in  the ferc issued order no 
and a series of related orders to implement its open access policies 
as a result of the order no 
program  the marketing and pricing of natural gas have been significantly altered 
the interstate pipelines traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas 
although 
table of contents these orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers  they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
in  the ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders  which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets 
among other things  order no 
effected changes in ferc regulations relating to scheduling procedures  capacity segmentation  penalties  rights of first refusal and information reporting 
most pipelines tariff filings to implement the requirements of order no 
have been accepted by the ferc and placed into effect 
in august   congress enacted the energy policy act of the epact 
among other matters  epact amends the natural gas act to make it unlawful for any entity  including otherwise non jurisdictional producers such as us  to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the ferc  in contravention of rules prescribed by the ferc 
the ferc s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful  in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc  or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc  for any entity  directly or indirectly  to use or employ any device  scheme or artifice to defraud  to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading  or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person 
epact also gives the ferc authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the natural gas act or natural gas policy act up to million per day per violation 
the new anti manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non jurisdictional sales  gathering or production  but does apply to activities of otherwise non jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted in connection with natural gas sales  purchases or transportation subject to ferc jurisdiction  which now includes the annual reporting requirements under order  described below 
epact therefore reflects a significant expansion of the ferc s enforcement authority 
we do not anticipate we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas 
in december  the ferc issued a rule order requiring that any market participant  including a producer such as concho  that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed million mmbtus during a calendar year to annually report  starting may   such sales and purchases to the ferc 
these rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the ferc in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation 
we do not anticipate that we will be affected by these rules any differently than other producers of natural gas 
we cannot accurately predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in which our natural gas is sold 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated 
therefore  we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by the ferc will continue 
however  we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers 
gathering service  which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services  is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters 
although its policy is still in flux  the ferc has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non jurisdictional gathering facilities  which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting natural gas to point of sale locations 
intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies 
the basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state 
during the legislative session  the texas state legislature passed hb the competition bill and hb the lug bill 
the competition bill gives the railroad commission of texas the ability to use either a cost of service method or a market based method for setting rates for natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation pipelines in formal rate proceedings 
it also gives the railroad commission specific authority to enforce its statutory duty to prevent discrimination in natural gas gathering and transportation  to enforce the requirement that parties participate in an informal complaint process and to punish purchasers  transporters  and gatherers for taking discriminatory actions against shippers and sellers 
the competition bill also provides producers with the unilateral option to determine 
table of contents whether or not confidentiality provisions are included in a contract to which a producer is a party for the sale  transportation  or gathering of natural gas 
the lug bill modifies the informal complaint process at the railroad commission with procedures unique to lost and unaccounted for natural gas issues 
it extends the types of information that can be requested  provides producers with an annual audit right  and provides the railroad commission with the authority to make determinations and issue orders in specific situations 
both the competition bill and the lug bill became effective september   and the railroad commission rules implementing the railroad commission s authority pursuant to the bills became effective on april  insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis  we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors 
like the regulation of interstate transportation rates  the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas 
regulation of production 
the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local  state and federal statutes  rules  orders and regulations 
federal  state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
all of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  the regulation of well spacing  and the plugging and abandonment of wells 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill  although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
the failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations 
environmental  health and safety matters general 
our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment 
these laws and regulations may  among other things require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production  and saltwater disposal activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations  such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells 
these laws  rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability 
additionally  environmental laws and regulations are revised frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs 
the following is a summary of some of the existing laws  rules and regulations to which our business is subject 
waste handling 
the resource conservation and recovery act the rcra and comparable state statutes  regulate the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
under the auspices of the federal environmental protection agency the epa  the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra  sometimes in conjunction with their own  more stringent requirements 
drilling fluids  produced waters  and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration  
table of contents development  and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under rcra s non hazardous waste provisions 
however  it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future 
any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act the cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes joint and several liability  without regard to fault or legality of conduct  on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred  and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site 
under cercla  such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently own  lease  or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years 
although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances  wastes  or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us  or on or under other locations  including off site locations  where such substances have been taken for disposal 
in addition  some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes  or hydrocarbons was not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes  remediate contaminated property  or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination 
water discharges 
the federal water pollution control act the clean water act and analogous state laws  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or an analogous state agency 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
air emissions 
the federal clean air act  and comparable state laws  regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements 
in addition  the epa has developed  and continues to develop  stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases ghgs and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
in response to such studies  the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs 
president obama has expressed support for legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of ghgs 
in addition  more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
depending on the particular program  we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations 
this requirement could increase our operational and compliance costs and result in reduced demand for our products 
also  on december   the us environmental protection agency the epa officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s 
table of contents atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in late september  the epa had proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings that would require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles that could also lead to the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limitations in clean air act permits for certain stationary sources 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in although our facilities were not subject to the epa s greenhouse gas reporting rule adopted in september  the epa has indicated that it is evaluating whether the rule should be applied to oil and natural gas production activities  perhaps on a field wide basis 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of  ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased costs or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
hydraulic fracturing 
the us congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act the sdwa  to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under the sdwa and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production 
sponsors of bills currently pending before the us senate and house of representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
proposed legislation would require  among other things  the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings against producers 
in addition  these bills  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting of hydraulic fracturing operations at the federal level  which could lead to operational delays  increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult for us to perform hydraulic fracturing  which is an important component of well development 
any impairment of our ability to perform hydraulic fracturing would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce oil and natural gas from new wells 
endangered species 
the federal endangered species act and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species 
some of our well drilling operations are conducted in areas where protected species are known to exist 
in these areas  we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species  and we may be prohibited from conducting drilling operations in certain locations or during certain seasons  such as breeding and nesting seasons  when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species 
it is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species 
the presence of a protected species in areas where we perform drilling activities could impair our ability to timely complete well drilling and development and could adversely affect our future production from those areas 
national environmental policy act 
oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the national environmental policy act the nepa 
nepa requires federal agencies  including the department of interior  to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment 
in the course of such evaluations  an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct  indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and  if necessary  will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment 
all of our current exploration and production activities  as well as proposed exploration and development plans  on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of nepa 
this process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 
osha and other laws and regulation 
we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha  and comparable state statutes 
the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state statutes require that we organize and or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other osha and comparable requirements 

table of contents we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for instance  we did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities during additionally  as of the date of this report  we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during however  we cannot assure you that the passage or application of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have an negative impact on our financial position or results of operation 
our employees at december   we employed persons 
of these  worked at our midland  texas headquarters  including texas field operations and in our new mexico field operations 
our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
we also utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services

non gaap financial measures and reconciliations pv pv is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  which is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
pv is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre tax basis 
pv is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date  before deducting future income taxes  discounted at percent 
we believe that the presentation of the pv is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes  and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties 
further  investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies 
we use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties 
pv  however  is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
our pv measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at december   and years ended december  in millions pv present value of future income taxes discounted at standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows ebitdax we define ebitdax as net income loss  plus exploration and abandonments expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  accretion expense  impairments of long lived assets  non cash stock based compensation expense  ineffective portion of cash flow hedges and unrealized gain loss on derivatives not designated as hedges  interest expense  bad debt expense and federal and state income taxes 
ebitdax is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by gaap 
our ebitdax measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand our operations  and it is also a material component of one of the financial covenants under our credit facility 
ebitdax is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income  as an indicator of our operating performance 
certain items excluded from ebitdax are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance  such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure  as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets 
ebitdax as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe that ebitdax is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other users of our consolidated financial statements  including by lenders pursuant to a covenant in our credit facility 
for example  ebitdax can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure  and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis 
further  under our credit facility  an event of default could arise if we were not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with specified financial ratios  including the maintenance of a quarterly ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitdax of no greater than to non compliance with this ratio could trigger an event of default under our credit facility

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report and other reports filed with the sec  before investing in our shares 
if any of the following risks were actually to occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business oil and natural gas prices are volatile 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our financial position  financial results  cash flow  access to capital and ability to grow 
our future financial condition  revenues  results of operations  rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and the prices prevailing from time to time for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile  and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future  especially given current geopolitical conditions 
this price volatility also affects the amount of our cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors beyond our control  including the level of consumer demand for crude oil and natural gas  the domestic and foreign supply of crude oil and natural gas  commodity processing  gathering and transportation availability  and the availability of refining capacity  the price and level of imports of foreign crude oil and natural gas  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain crude oil price and production controls  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuel sources  weather conditions  political conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions  including the middle east  africa and south america  technological advances affecting energy consumption  variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices  and worldwide economic conditions 
furthermore  crude oil and natural gas prices were particularly volatile in for example  the nymex oil prices in ranged from a high of to a low of per bbl and the nymex natural gas prices in ranged from a high of to a low of per mmbtu 
further  the nymex oil prices and nymex natural gas prices reached lows of per bbl and per mmbtu  respectively  during the period from january  to february  declines in oil and natural gas prices would not only reduce our revenue  but could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and reserves 
if the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines  we may  among other things  be unable to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity  repay current or future indebtedness or obtain additional capital on attractive terms  all of which can adversely affect the value of our common stock 

table of contents our estimates of proved reserves have been prepared under new sec rules which went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after december   which may make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future 
this report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of december   which have been prepared and presented under new sec rules 
these new rules are effective for fiscal years ending on or after december   and require sec reporting companies to prepare their reserves estimates using revised reserve definitions and revised pricing based on a month unweighted average of the first day of the month pricing 
the previous rules required that reserve estimates be calculated using last day of the year pricing 
the pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of december  was based on an unweighted average twelve month west texas intermediate posted price of per bbl for oil and a henry hub spot natural gas price of per mmbtu for natural gas 
as a result of this change in pricing methodology  direct comparisons of our previously reported reserves amounts may be more difficult 
another impact of the new sec rules is a general requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
this new rule has limited and may continue to limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program  particularly as we develop our significant acreage in west texas and southeast new mexico 
moreover  we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill on those reserves within the required five year timeframe 
the sec has not reviewed our or any reporting company s reserve estimates under the new rules and has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the new rules and may not issue further interpretive guidance on the new rules 
accordingly  while the estimates of our proved reserves and related pv and standardized measure at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new sec rules  those estimates could differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific sec interpretive guidance 
drilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could cause our expenses to increase or our cash flows and production volumes to decrease 
our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploration  development and production activities 
our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable crude oil or natural gas production 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
our cost of drilling  completing  equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical or less economic than forecasted 
further  many factors may curtail  delay or cancel drilling  including the following delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements  pressure or irregularities in geological formations  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  reductions in crude oil and natural gas prices  surface access restrictions  loss of title or other title related issues  
table of contents crude oil  natural gas liquids or natural gas gathering  transportation and processing availability restrictions or limitations  and limitations in the market for crude oil and natural gas 
estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise 
the actual quantities of our proved reserves and our future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated 
numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net cash flows therefrom 
our estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are based on various assumptions  which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate 
petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and or natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including the following historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the quality  quantity and interpretation of available relevant data  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  the quality  quantity and interpretation of available relevant data  assumptions concerning future commodity prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs  and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items  or other items not identified below  may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future commodity prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material 
standardized measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the sec 
our non gaap financial measure  pv  is a similar reporting convention that we have disclosed in this report 
both measures require the use of operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation 
consequently  they will not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions  nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and natural gas properties 
accordingly  estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received 
in addition  the ten percent discount factor  which is required by the rules and regulations of the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our company or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
therefore  standardized measure or pv included or incorporated by reference in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves 
any adjustments to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of oil or natural gas may decrease the value of our common stock 

table of contents if average oil prices were per bbl lower than the average price we used  our pv at december   would have decreased from  million to  million 
if average natural gas prices were per mcf lower than the average price we used  our pv at december   would have decreased from  million to  million 
any adjustments to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of oil or natural gas may decrease the value of our common stock 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures 
we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all  which could lead to a decline in our crude oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
at december   total debt outstanding under our credit facility was million  and million was available to be borrowed 
assuming the proceeds of million from our february equity offering had been received on december  and were applied to reduce borrowings under our credit facility  our availability under our credit facility would have been million 
expenditures for exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources 
we incurred approximately million in acquisition  exploration and development activities during the year ended december  on our properties million related to acquisitions  and under our capital budget  we intend to invest approximately million for exploration and development activities and acquisition of leasehold acreage  dependent on our cash flow and our commodity price outlook 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures  other than significant acquisitions  primarily through cash flow from operations and through borrowings under our credit facility  however  our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
the issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock 
additional borrowings under our credit facility or the issuance of additional debt securities will require that a greater portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
in addition  our credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than indebtedness under our credit facility 
if we desire to issue additional debt securities other than as expressly permitted under our credit facility  we will be required to seek the consent of the lenders in accordance with the requirements of the facility  which consent may be withheld by the lenders under our credit facility in their discretion 
if we incur certain additional indebtedness  our borrowing base under our credit facility will be reduced 
additional financing also may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in the event additional capital resources are unavailable  we may curtail drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of crude oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which our crude oil and natural gas are sold  global credit and securities markets  the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital and the cost of the capital  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves  lending requirements or regulations  or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
as a result  we may require additional capital to fund our operations  and we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing to satisfy our capital requirements 
if cash generated from operations or cash available under our credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of 
table of contents our operations relating to the development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves  and could adversely affect our production  revenues and results of operations 
we are subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  timing  manner or feasibility of conducting our operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration  development and production  and related saltwater disposal operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations 
in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state  local and governmental authorities 
we may incur substantial costs and experience delays in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations 
in addition  our costs of compliance may increase or our operations may be otherwise adversely affected if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted  or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations 
these and other costs could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for  and the production of  oil and natural gas 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations  as interpreted and enforced  could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
our operations expose us to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental and operational safety matters 
we may incur significant delays  costs and liabilities as a result of environmental  health and safety requirements applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration  development and production  and related saltwater disposal activities 
these delays  costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment  health and safety  including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  and  in some instances  issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations 
in addition  claims for damages to persons or property  including natural resources  may result from the environmental  health and safety impacts of our operations 
strict as well as joint and several liability may be imposed under certain environmental laws  which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
new laws  regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs 
if we were not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues  our production  revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to obtain funding at all  or obtain funding on acceptable terms  to meet our future capital needs because of uncertainty in the credit and capital markets 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and will likely continue to be  uncertain and volatile 
these issues  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk and the ongoing weak economic conditions have made  and will likely continue to make  it difficult to obtain funding 
in particular  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased while the ability to obtain funds from those markets may  depending on the timing  prove difficult 
also  as a result of concern about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
table of contents in addition  our ability to obtain capital under our credit facility may be impaired because of the downturn in the financial market  including the issues surrounding the solvency of certain institutional lenders and the failure of several banks 
specifically  we may be unable to obtain adequate funding under our credit facility because our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations  the borrowing base under our credit facility is redetermined at least twice a year and may decrease due to a decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves  lending requirements or regulations  or for other reasons  or if any lender is unable or unwilling to fund their respective portion of any advance under our credit facility  then the other lenders thereunder are not required to provide additional funding to make up the portion of the advance that the defaulting lender refused to fund 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to implement our development plan  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
our lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities  which may materially impact our operations 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding debt under our credit facility  and our borrowing base was million 
the borrowing base limitation under our credit facility is semi annually redetermined based upon a number of factors  including commodity prices and reserve levels 
in addition to such semi annual redeterminations  between redeterminations we and  if requested by percent of our lenders  our lenders  may each request one special redetermination 
upon a redetermination  our borrowing base could be substantially reduced  and in the event the amount outstanding under our credit facility at any time exceeds the borrowing base at such time  we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings 
if we incur certain additional indebtedness  our borrowing base under our credit facility will be reduced 
we expect to utilize cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  equity financings and asset sales to fund our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
a reduction in our borrowing base could limit our activities 
in addition  we may significantly alter our capitalization in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties 
these changes in capitalization may significantly increase our level of debt 
if we incur additional debt for these or other purposes  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
a higher level of debt also increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance which is affected by general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 
we now have  and will continue to have  a significant amount of indebtedness  and the terms of our credit facility require us to pay higher interest rate margins as we utilize a larger percentage of our available borrowing base 
at december   we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately million comprised of amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our senior notes due assuming our debt outstanding under our credit facility of million at december  was held constant  if interest rates had been higher or lower by percent per annum  our annual interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
at december   our total borrowing capacity under our credit facility was million  of which million was available 
assuming the proceeds of million from our february equity offering had been received on december  and were applied to reduce borrowings under our credit facility  our availability under our credit facility would have been million 
our current and future indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could impair our ability to make investments and obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  
table of contents limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  limit our ability to borrow funds that may be necessary to operate or expand our business  put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have less debt  increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases  and hinder our ability to adjust to rapidly changing economic and industry conditions 
our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we can successfully implement our business strategy 
we may not be able to implement or realize the benefits of our business strategy 
in addition  if we fail to comply with the covenants or other terms of any agreements governing our debt  our lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of that debt and foreclose upon any collateral securing that debt 
our producing properties are located primarily in the permian basin of southeast new mexico and west texas  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area 
in addition  we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area 
our producing properties in our core operating areas are geographically concentrated in the permian basin of southeast new mexico and west texas 
at december   approximately percent of our proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area 
as a result of this concentration  we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors  delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation  processing or transportation capacity constraints  market limitations  or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil  natural gas or natural gas liquids 
in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above  at december   approximately i percent of our proved reserves were attributable to the yeso formation  which includes both the paddock and blinebry intervals  underlying our oil and natural gas properties located in southeast new mexico  and ii percent of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play in west texas 
this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks  such as changes in field wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut in all of our wells within a field 
future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
declines in commodity prices may result in having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
if this occurs  or if our estimates of production or economic factors change  accounting rules may require us to write down  as a noncash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairments 
we are required to perform impairment tests on proved assets whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our proved oil and natural gas properties 
to the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties  the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore require a write down 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred 
we periodically evaluate our unproved oil and natural gas properties for impairment  and could be required to recognize noncash charges to earnings of future periods 
at december   we carried unproved property costs of million 
gaap requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a project by project basis in comparison to their estimated fair value 
these evaluations will be affected by the results of exploration activities  commodity price circumstances  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of the leases  contracts and permits appurtenant to such projects 
if the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project  we will recognize noncash charges to earnings of future periods 

table of contents part of our strategy involves exploratory drilling  including drilling in new or emerging plays 
as a result  our drilling results in these areas are uncertain  and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful 
the results of our exploratory drilling in new or emerging plays are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production 
since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited or no production history  we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results 
as a result  our cost of drilling  completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected  and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful 
our commodity price risk management program may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in our making cash payments to our counterparties 
to reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas  we have entered into and may in the future enter into additional commodity price risk management arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production 
the agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time 
commodity price risk management arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices in some circumstances  including the following the counterparty to a commodity price risk management contract may default on its contractual obligations to us  there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in a commodity price risk management agreement and actual prices received  or market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive  resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties 
our commodity price risk management activities could have the effect of reducing our revenues  net income and the value of our common stock 
at december   the net unrealized loss on our commodity price risk management contracts was approximately million 
an average increase in the commodity price of per barrel of oil and per mmbtu for natural gas from the commodity prices at december   would have increased the net unrealized loss on our commodity price risk management contracts  as reflected on our balance sheet at december   by million 
we may continue to incur significant unrealized gains or losses in the future from our commodity price risk management activities to the extent market prices increase or decrease and our derivatives contracts remain in place 
we have entered into interest rate derivative instruments that may subject us to loss of income 
we have entered into derivative instruments designed to limit the interest rate risk under our current credit facility or any credit facilities we may enter into in the future 
these derivative instruments can involve the exchange of a portion of our floating rate interest obligations for fixed rate interest obligations or a cap on our exposure to floating interest rates to reduce our exposure to the volatility of interest rates 
while we may enter into instruments limiting our exposure to higher market interest rates  we cannot assure you that any interest rate derivative instruments we implement will be effective  and furthermore  even if effective these instruments may not offer complete protection from the risk of higher interest rates 
all interest rate derivative instruments involve certain additional risks  such as the counterparty may default on its contractual obligations to us  there may be issues with regard to the legal enforceability of such instruments  the early repayment of one of our interest rate derivative instruments could lead to prepayment penalties  or unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the instrument and a change in current period expense 

table of contents if we enter into derivative instruments that require us to post cash collateral  our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced  which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures 
the use of derivatives may  in some cases  require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties 
if we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices or interest rates change in a manner adverse to us  our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced  which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures and make payments on our indebtedness 
future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and highly volatile oil and natural gas prices and interest rates 
nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative instruments or commodity purchase agreements could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we routinely enter into derivative instruments with a number of counterparties to reduce our exposure to changes in oil and natural gas prices and interest rates 
a number of financial institutions similar to those that serve as counterparties to our derivative instruments have been adversely affected by the global credit crisis 
if a counterparty to one of these derivative instruments cannot or will not perform under the contract  we will not realize the benefit of the derivative  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  substantially all of our accounts receivable result from oil and natural gas sales to third parties in the energy industry 
recent market conditions have resulted in downgrades to credit ratings of energy industry merchants and financial institutions  affecting the liquidity of several of our purchasers and counterparties 
we extend credit to our purchasers based on each party s creditworthiness  but we generally have not required our purchasers to provide collateral support for their obligations to us and therefore have no assurances that our counterparties will have the ability to pay us 
if a purchaser of our oil and natural gas production fails to meet its obligations under our commodity purchase agreement  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our identified inventory of drilling locations and recompletion opportunities are scheduled out over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 
we have identified and scheduled the drilling of certain of our drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi year development activities on our existing acreage 
at december   we had identified  gross drilling locations with proved undeveloped reserves attributable to  of such locations 
these identified locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties  including i our ability to timely drill wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances  ii the availability of capital  equipment  services and personnel  iii seasonal conditions  iv regulatory and third party approvals  v oil and natural gas prices  and vi drilling and recompletion costs and results 
because of these uncertainties  we may never drill the numerous potential locations we have identified or produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential locations 
as such  our actual development activities may materially differ from those presently identified  which could adversely affect our production  revenues and results of operations 
approximately percent of our total estimated net proved reserves at december   were undeveloped  and those reserves may not ultimately be developed 
at december   approximately percent of our total estimated net proved reserves were undeveloped 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling 
our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully 
these assumptions  however  may not prove correct 
our reserve report at december  includes estimates of total future development costs over the next five years associated with our proved undeveloped reserves of approximately billion 
if we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves  or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves  we will be required to write off these reserves 
in addition  under the sec s recently updated reserve rules  because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to 
table of contents wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking  we may be required to write off any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five year timeframe 
any such write offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our securities 
unless we replace our crude oil and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our cash flow  our ability to raise capital and the value of our common stock 
unless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced 
producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and results of operations  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
the value of our common stock and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by production 
we may not be able to develop  exploit  find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production 
we may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired companies  and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow 
one aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses or assets that complement or expand our current business 
we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities 
even if we do identify attractive candidates  we may not be able to complete the acquisition of them or do so on commercially acceptable terms 
in addition  our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes due impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions 
our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes due also limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness  which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses or assets 
if we desire to engage in an acquisition that is otherwise prohibited by our credit facility or the indenture governing our senior notes due  we will be required to seek the consent of our lenders or the holders of the senior notes in accordance with the requirements of the facility or the indenture  which consent may be withheld by the lenders under our credit facility or such holders of senior notes in their sole discretion 
furthermore  given the current situation in the credit markets  many lenders are reluctant to provide consents in any circumstances  including to allow accretive transactions 
if we acquire another business or assets  we could have difficulty integrating its operations  systems  management and other personnel and technology with our own 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to pay for any future acquisitions  subject to the limitations described above 
our acquisitions may prove to be worth less than what we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and could expose us to potentially significant liabilities 
we obtained the majority of our current reserve base through acquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped acreage 
we expect that acquisitions will continue to contribute to our future growth 
in connection these and potential future acquisitions  we are often only able to perform limited due diligence 
successful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors  including estimates of recoverable reserves  the timing of recovering reserves  exploration potential  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental  regulatory and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and we cannot make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy 
in connection with our assessments  we perform a review of the acquired properties 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
we do not inspect every well 
even when we inspect a well  we do not always discover structural  subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise 

table of contents there may be threatened  contemplated  asserted or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental  title  regulatory  tax  contract  litigation or other matters of which we are unaware  which could materially and adversely affect our production  revenues and results of operations 
we are sometimes able to obtain contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities  but we generally acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
in addition  even when we are able to obtain such indemnification from the sellers  these indemnification obligations usually expire over time and expose us to potential unindemnified liabilities  which could materially adversely affect our production  revenues and results of operations 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  making it more difficult for us to acquire properties  market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel 
many of our competitors possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours  which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate 
those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
in addition  those companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 
the cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
our failure to acquire properties  market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel and adequately compensate personnel could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
shortages of oilfield equipment  services and qualified personnel could delay our drilling program and increase the prices we pay to obtain such equipment  services and personnel 
the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations  geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices  causing periodic shortages 
historically  there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs  pipe and other oilfield equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled 
these factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment  services and personnel 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling and workover rigs  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
it is beyond our control and ability to predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and  if so  what their timing and duration will be 
these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin  cash flow and operating results  or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned and budgeted or which we may plan in the future 
our exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves 
drilling activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be encountered 
new wells that we drill may not be productive  or we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically 
drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable results  not only from dry holes but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling  operating and other costs 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect 
table of contents the economics of a project 
further  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or lost circulation in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements  and increases in the cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  electricity  supplies  materials  drilling or workover rigs  equipment and services 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our crude oil and natural gas operations 
in addition  we may not be insured for  or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against  these risks 
we are not insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including the possibility of environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of crude oil  natural gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater contamination  abnormally pressured or structured formations  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse  fires  explosions and ruptures of pipelines  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of injury or loss of life  damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repair and remediation costs 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
the occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 

table of contents market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas processing or transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas  the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities  competition for such facilities and the inability of such facilities to gather  transport or process our production due to shutdowns or curtailments arising from mechanical  operational or weather related matters  including hurricanes and other severe weather conditions 
our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering and transportation systems  pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to shut in or otherwise curtail production from wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of oil  natural gas liquids or natural gas pipeline or gathering  transportation or processing capacity 
if that were to occur  then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until suitable arrangements were made to market our production 
certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
president obama s proposed fiscal year budget includes proposed legislation that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to us tax laws  including the elimination of certain key united states federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or otherwise limit certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the adoption of climate change legislation by congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
on june   the united states house of representatives approved adoption of the american clean energy and security act of  also known as the waxman markey cap and trade legislation the acesa 
the purpose of acesa is to control and reduce emissions of ghgs in the united states 
ghgs are certain gases  including carbon dioxide and methane  that may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
acesa would establish an economy wide cap on emissions of ghgs in the united states and would require an overall reduction in ghg emissions of percent from levels by  and by over percent by under acesa  most sources of ghg emissions would be required to obtain ghg emission allowances corresponding to their annual emissions of ghgs 
the number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary to meet acesa s overall emission reduction goals 
as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year  the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 
the net effect of acesa would be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil  refined petroleum products  and natural gas 
on november   the united states senate committee on environment and public works approved the clean energy jobs and american power act of for controlling and reducing emissions of ghgs in the united states 
this bill differs in certain areas from acesa 
if the senate adopts ghg legislation that is different from acesa  the senate legislation would need to be reconciled with acesa and both chambers would be required to approve identical legislation before it could become law 
president obama has indicated that he is in support of the adoption of legislation to control and reduce emissions of ghgs through an emission allowance permitting system that results in fewer allowances being issued each year but that allows parties to buy  sell and 
table of contents trade allowances as needed to fulfill their ghg emission obligations 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the senate may approve any climate change legislation or how any bill approved by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of ghgs could require us to incur increased operating costs  and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
congress is currently considering legislation to impose restrictions on certain transactions involving derivatives  which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions 
acesa contains provisions that would prohibit private energy commodity derivative and hedging transactions 
acesa would expand the power of the commodity futures trading commission  or cftc  to regulate derivative transactions related to energy commodities  including oil and natural gas  and to mandate clearance of such derivative contracts through registered derivative clearing organizations 
under acesa  the cftc s expanded authority over energy derivatives would terminate upon the adoption of general legislation covering derivative regulatory reform 
the cftc is considering whether to set limits on trading and positions in commodities with finite supply  particularly energy commodities  such as crude oil  natural gas and other energy products 
the cftc also is evaluating whether position limits should be applied consistently across all markets and participants 
separately  the house of representatives adopted financial regulatory reform legislation on december   that among other things would impose comprehensive regulation on the over the counter otc derivatives marketplace 
this legislation would subject swap dealers and major swap participants to substantial supervision and regulation  including capital standards  margin requirements  business conduct standards  and recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
it also would require central clearing for transactions entered into between swap dealers or major swap participants  and would provide the cftc with authority to impose position limits in the otc derivatives markets 
a major swap participant generally would be someone other than a dealer who maintains a substantial net position in outstanding swaps  excluding swaps used for commercial hedging or for reducing or mitigating commercial risk  or whose positions create substantial net counterparty exposure that could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the us banking system or financial markets 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when congress may act on derivatives legislation or how any climate change bill approved by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  any laws or regulations that may be adopted that subject us to additional capital or margin requirements relating to  or to additional restrictions on  our trading and commodity positions could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activity 
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional natural gas wells in shale formations 
this process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production 
sponsors of two companion bills  which are currently pending in the energy and commerce committee and the environmental and public works committee of the house of representatives and senate  respectively  have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
the proposed legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
in addition  this legislation  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens 
the adoption of any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or otherwise limiting  the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 

table of contents the loss of our chief executive officer or other key personnel could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
we depend  and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future  on the services of our chief executive officer  timothy a 
leach  and other officers and key employees who have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects  maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties  marketing oil and natural gas production  and developing and executing acquisition  financing and hedging strategies 
our ability to hire and retain our officers and key employees is important to our continued success and growth 
the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
because we do not control the development of certain of the properties in which we own interests  but do not operate  we may not be able to achieve any production from these properties in a timely manner 
at december   approximately percent of our proved reserves were attributable to properties for which we were not the operator 
as a result  the success and timing of drilling and development activities on such nonoperated properties depend upon a number of factors  including the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities  the timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operators expertise and financial resources  the approval of other participants in such properties  and the selection and application of suitable technology 
if drilling and development activities are not conducted on these properties or are not conducted on a timely basis  we may be unable to increase our production or offset normal production declines or we will be required to write off the reserves attributable thereto  which may adversely affect our production  revenues and results of operations 
any such write offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our securities uncertainties associated with enhanced recovery methods may result in us not realizing an acceptable return on our investments in such projects 
we inject water into formations on some of our properties to increase the production of oil and natural gas 
we may in the future expand these efforts to more of our properties or employ other enhanced recovery methods in our operations 
the additional production and reserves  if any  attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict 
if our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of oil and natural gas in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate  we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects 
in addition  if proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing become law  the cost of some of these enhanced recovery methods could increase substantially 
a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business by decreasing our revenues and increasing our costs 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts and other armed conflict involving the united states may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
if any of these events occur or escalate  the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas  potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenue 
oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks  and our operations could be adversely impacted if significant infrastructure or facilities used for the production  transportation  processing or marketing of oil and natural gas production are destroyed or damaged 
costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats  and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain  if available at all 

table of contents risks relating to our common stock our restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders  including the organization of our board of directors as a classified board  which allows no more than approximately one third of our directors to be elected each year  stockholders cannot remove directors from our board of directors except for cause and then only by the holders of not less than percent of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock  the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders 
because we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock  investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business 
any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on  among other things  our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  level of indebtedness  statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant 
covenants contained in our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes due restrict the payment of dividends 
investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize a return on their investment 
investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 
the availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may issue securities to raise cash for acquisitions 
we may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock 
we may also issue securities convertible into  or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  our common stock 
any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company  reduce our earnings per share and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock 
in addition  sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  could reduce the market price of our common stock 
this could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities

in december  the sec released the final rules for modernization of oil and gas reporting that have become effective for reserve reporting as of december  the modernization disclosure requirements require reporting of oil and natural gas reserves using a price based on a month unweighted average of the first day of the month prices rather than year end prices and the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves  if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
companies may also elect to disclose probable and possible reserves meeting new sec definitions in sec filed documents  as well as additional reserve cases showing pricing and cost sensitivities 
in addition  companies are required to report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a reserves audit

our oil and natural gas reserves 
the following table sets forth our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves  pv and standardized measure at december  pv and standardized measure include the present value of our estimated future abandonment and site restoration costs for proved properties net of the present value of estimated salvage proceeds from each of these properties 
our reserve estimates and our computation of future net cash flows are based on a month unweighted average of the first day of the month pricing of per bbl west texas intermediate posted oil price and on a month unweighted average of the first day of the month pricing of per mmbtu henry hub spot natural gas price  adjusted for location and quality by property

pv is a non gaap financial measure and is derived from the standardized measure which is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
pv is a computation of the standardized measure on a pre tax basis 
pv is equal to the standardized measure at the applicable date  before deducting future income taxes  discounted at percent 
we believe that the presentation of the pv is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes  and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties 
further  investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies 
we use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties 
pv  however  is not a substitute for the standardized measure 
our pv measure and the standardized measure do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves

as a result of our adoption on december  of the new sec rules related to disclosure of oil and natural gas reserves  we added approximately mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves 
the majority of the additional reserves are within our two core operating areas  the yeso and wolfberry 
the addition is primarily attributable to booking downspacing locations in the yeso and wolfberry where there was a high degree of confidence based on employed technologies that have demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability 
historically  our drilling programs were substantially funded from our cash flow and were weighted towards drilling unproven locations 
our expectation in the future is to continue to fund our drilling programs primarily from our cash flows 
based on our current expectations of our cash flows and drilling programs  which includes drilling of proved undeveloped and unproven locations  we believe that we can fund from our cash flow and  if needed  our credit facility  the drilling of our current inventory of proved undeveloped locations in the next years

table of contents title to our properties as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties  we conduct a more thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects 
to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect defects affecting those properties  we are typically responsible for curing any such defects at our expense 
we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured known material title defects on such property 
we have reviewed the title to substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry 
prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties  we perform title reviews on the most significant properties and  depending on the materiality of properties  we may obtain a title opinion or review or update previously obtained title opinions
