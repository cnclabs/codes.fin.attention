item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview throughout the periods reflected in this report  we were a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing  manufacturing and commercializing important medicines for patients with cancer and other life threatening conditions 
we operated in three business segments products  royalties and contract manufacturing 
we had a portfolio of four marketed products  oncaspar  our oncology product for the first line treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia all  depocyt  for the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis  abelcet  for the treatment of invasive fungal infections  and adagen  for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease 
our drug development programs utilize several cutting edge technologies  including our industry leading pegylation technology platform 
our pegylation technology was used to develop two of our products  oncaspar and adagen  and has created a royalty revenue stream from licensing partnerships for other products developed using the technology 
we also engaged in contract manufacturing for other pharmaceutical companies to broaden our revenue base 
on november   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our specialty pharmaceutical business comprised principally of the products and contract manufacturing segments and the in process research and development associated with our currently marketed products the sale of specialty to klee pharmaceuticals  inc now known as sigma tau pharmasource  inc  defiante farmac utica  s 
a and sigma tau finanziaria spa collectively  the sigma tau group 
the sale agreement called for a cash payment of million  subject to certain customary working capital adjustments  plus an additional amount of up to million based on certain success milestones 
in addition  we may receive royalties of to percent on incremental net sales above a baseline amount from our four marketed specialty pharmaceutical products through the sale of specialty was approved by shareholders at a special meeting held january  on january   we consummated the sale of specialty 
pursuant to a transition services agreement  we will perform product support research and development 
we also will provide various general and administrative functions for the purchasing parties for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction 
in consideration for this work  we will be compensated based upon costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the transition services agreement 
following the sale of specialty  we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of important medicines for patients with cancer 
our drug development program utilizes several cutting edge technologies  including our customized linker technology and the locked nucleic acid lna technology 
we currently have three compounds in human clinical development  peg sn  the hif alpha antagonist and the survivin antagonist 
our principal royalty revenue streams were not part of the sale of specialty 
because the sale of specialty was subject to shareholder approval and that approval was not obtained until january  our statements of financial position as of december  and and results of operations and cash flows for the three years ended december  include the assets  liabilities  results of operations and cash flows of the specialty pharmaceutical operations 
beginning in  the operations and cash flows of the products and contract manufacturing segments will be eliminated from the continuing operations of the company and will be classified as discontinued operations 
similarly  assets and liabilities of the specialty pharmaceutical business will be presented separately in the balance sheet of the company 
throughout the discussion and analysis that follows  the specialty pharmaceutical operations have been included in all historical data as they were an integral part of the company through december  reference has been made to the sale  where necessary  for a complete discussion of future trends and financial condition 
results of operations summary level overview  year ended december  compared to total revenues were down percent  although favorable costs of production resulted in improved gross margin of approximately million 
total revenues in were million compared to million in net product sales rose million in more than offsetting this increase were declines in both royalties and contract manufacturing revenues of million and million  respectively 
gross margins improved significantly in to percent of product sales and contract manufacturing compared to percent in increased research and development spending of million was partially offset by million lower selling  general and administrative expense 
we realized gains on the repurchase of a portion of our notes  incurred lower investment income and interest expense and were able to utilize certain income tax net operating losses 
the net result of all of these factors was net income in of million compared to a net loss in of million 
summary level overview  year ended december  compared to total revenues in rose to million compared to million in net product sales and contract manufacturing revenues both rose in  contributing approximately million to total revenue growth for the year 
partially offsetting this increase was an percent decline  or million  in royalty revenues during in august  we sold a percent interest in pegintron royalties  so an overall decrease in royalty revenues of percent indicates underlying growth in the segment 
gross margins were slightly improved in compared to with efficiencies stemming from the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities beginning to be experienced late in spending was up in both research and development and general and administrative areas 
we incurred million of restructuring charges which was million less than in and interest expense was lower in than in by million due primarily to the repayment of our notes 
also  significantly affecting the year to year comparison  was the gain in of million on the sale of the percent interest in pegintron royalties 
further discussion of these and other revenue and profitability fluctuations is contained in the segment analyses that follow 
the percentage changes throughout management s discussion and analysis are based on amounts stated in thousands of dollars and not the rounded millions of dollars reflected in this section 
following is a reconciliation of segment profitability to consolidated loss income before income tax millions of dollars overview year ended december december december products segment profit royalties segment profit contract manufacturing segment profit corporate and other expenses loss income before income tax includes million gain on sale of percent interest in pegintron royalties 
we do not allocate certain corporate income and expenses not directly identifiable with the respective segments  including exploratory and preclinical research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  investment income  interest income  interest expense or income taxes 
research and development expense is considered a corporate expense unless it relates to an existing marketed product or a product candidate enters phase iii clinical trials at which time related costs may be chargeable to an operating segment 
products segment products segment profitability millions of dollars year ended december change december change december revenues cost of product sales research and development selling and marketing amortization of intangibles restructuring charge segment profit revenues sales performance of individual products is provided below millions of dollars product year ended december change december change december oncaspar depocyt abelcet adagen totals year ended december  compared to net product sales rose percent during  to million compared to million in oncaspar sales rose percent over levels  depocyt sales rose percent and adagen sales rose percent 
the growth in sales of oncaspar is reflective of its continuing expansion in the pediatric all market and adoption in adult and young adult populations 
oncaspar experienced unit growth of percent for the year  however this was partially offset by the negative effect of chargeback claims see below 
sales of depocyt and adagen tend to fluctuate from period to period given their very small patient populations although improved patient compliance with dosing regimens appears to have contributed to approximately percent volume growth for adagen in both products benefited from a january price increase however the prior year chargeback claims also affected depocyt 
abelcet continues to experience both competitive and pricing pressures in the marketplace from other therapeutics 
abelcet sales were down percent due to volume declines and approximately percent due to lower average selling price in compared to also impacting net sales for the full year were accruals for prior period chargebacks totaling million that had been claimed by certain wholesalers 
the adverse effect of the accrual fell most heavily on reported oncaspar revenues approximately million with some impact also upon depocyt revenues million 
final resolution of this matter is not expected to result in a material adjustment 
year ended december  compared to net product sales grew approximately percent during  rising to million from million in oncaspar and adagen accounted for the majority of this increase 
oncaspar volume increased percent year over year with the remaining oncaspar revenue growth being attributable to a price increase effective in the first quarter of this price increase was necessitated by significantly higher raw material cost and expenses related to the development of manufacturing process improvements and transfer of technology from our supplier 
adagen sales were favorably affected by a first quarter price increase 
abelcet continued to experience competitive pressures in the marketplace 
the percent decline in abelcet net sales was the result of approximately percent volume reduction and approximately percent decrease in average net selling price 
sales of depocyt and adagen have historically experienced period to period fluctuations due to their small patient bases 
cost of product sales cost of sales of marketed products for the year ended december  was million or approximately percent of sales compared to percent in the year over year improvements in gross margin reflect  in large part  efficiencies derived across all products from the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities and favorable spending variances 
there was also a favorable effect on gross margins attributable to product mix 
cost of product sales for included million immediate amortization of a million licensing intangible milestone payment described below that was triggered that year 
also adversely affecting the margins was the write off of certain batches of oncaspar during the third quarter of amounting to approximately million related to the transfer of technology and consolidation of activities at our indianapolis  indiana facility 
cost of sales of marketed products for increased to million  compared to million for costs rose at a slower rate than did revenues resulting in a decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of sales  to approximately percent in from approximately percent in during the second quarter of  we recorded million of accelerated amortization associated with a million licensing milestone payment that was triggered during that quarter in connection with our rights to market and distribute oncaspar 
this was done to reflect the benefit derived from the intangible over the entire life of the agreement 
in  we incurred a million charge for validation batches produced in connection with the transfer of production of oncaspar and adagen from our south plainfield  new jersey facility to our indianapolis facility 
the cost of producing oncaspar  as a percentage of oncaspar sales  rose nearly percent during compared to due primarily to the timing of the effects of raw material price increases under a december supply agreement 
largely offsetting the rise in oncaspar costs were improvements in the cost of manufacture of adagen and abelcet which together comprise nearly half of total net sales 
the improvements in the year to year comparisons of adagen and abelcet cost profiles were due  in large part  to certain batch write offs experienced during  including the validation batches referred to above in connection with the transfer of production to our indianapolis facility 
overall  gross margins were favorably affected by increased selling prices we put into effect early in research and development expenses research and development spending related to marketed products has been directed largely towards securing and maintaining a reliable supply of the ingredients used in the production of oncaspar and adagen 
we have invested in the next generation of l asparaginase  used in the production of oncaspar  and recombinant adenosine deaminase enzyme  or ada  used in the production of adagen 
products segment research and development expense was million in  percent greater than was incurred during through january  we had enrolled patients in the pivotal trial evaluating the next generation oncaspar in pediatric all 
we also completed qualification batches for the scale up of the improved manufacturing process associated with oncaspar 
in the second half of  we initiated the technology and assay transfer for the recombinant ada process 
products segment research and development expense increased million or percent during compared to during  we transferred the oncaspar manufacturing process technology to our contract manufacturing organization and initiated our pivotal clinical trial 
during the year  we further improved the adagen process in our process development lab 
research related to improvement of the manufacturing processes and pharmaceutical properties of both oncaspar and adagen are expected to continue under the ownership and direction of the sigma tau group 
we will support these activities under a transition services agreement between the parties whereby we will provide technology transfer services related to oncaspar and adagen 
we will be compensated for these services based upon costs incurred plus a specified mark up defined in the transition services agreement 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  as well as other commercial expenses and marketing programs to support our sales force 
also included in selling and marketing expenses were the costs associated with our medical affairs function  including a medical science liaison group 
selling and marketing expenses were lower in than in by million  or percent 
the decrease was attributable to more focused spending on our marketed products in response to market conditions and sales trends 
in addition  we experienced some reduced employee compensation expense as a result of the restructuring effort taken early in the year 
selling and marketing expenses declined million or approximately percent in when compared to due in large part to the consolidation and realignment of our sales forces in late amortization of acquired intangibles amortization expense is principally related to abelcet intangible assets and remained essentially unchanged at million per year for each of the past three years 
restructuring as part of our continued efforts to streamline operations  we undertook a reduction in our workforce during the first quarter of during  the program  initiated in  to consolidate manufacturing operations at our indianapolis facility was completed and our south plainfield  new jersey location was decommissioned 
during  in addition to the manufacturing consolidation initiative  we combined our previous two specialized sales forces into one 
the company incurred the following costs in connection with its restructuring programs during the years ended december   and related to the products segment 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  employee termination costs programs manufacturing sales forces write down of manufacturing assets other restructuring charge the million cost of employee termination  consisting of severance and related benefits related to the restructuring was fully paid out by the end of with no adjustments 
for the manufacturing restructuring  employee termination costs were million in and million in severance payments related to those costs commenced during with the successful transfer of production to the company s indianapolis facility and closure of the south plainfield facility 
payment in amounted to million and in amounted to million 
during  prior accruals for certain benefits provided to exiting employees were adjusted downward by million based on actual utilization 
no severance liability remained as of december  the sales force realignment resulted in approximately million of employee termination costs  all of which were paid out during write down of manufacturing assets and other costs associated with the manufacturing restructuring in totaled approximately million 
the majority of these costs relate to the acceleration of amortization of leasehold improvements at the south plainfield facility in resulting from a reassessment of the estimated time to complete the manufacturing consolidation 
during  we also accelerated the depreciation of certain assets consisting primarily of manufacturing equipment that would not be transferred to the indianapolis facility and were decommissioned 
our use of the leased south plainfield facility not included in the sale of specialty has ended  but we continue to be primarily responsible for the obligations attendant to the continuing operating lease of the facility including returning the facility to its original condition upon expiration  if necessary 
beginning in january  we entered into a sublease of the facility under which we will receive rental income in excess of the rental expense being incurred under the original lease 
we may experience additional charges associated with the lease or its termination prior to the contractual expiration of the lease in october sale of specialty effective january   the products segment was sold to the sigma tau group 
see overview above 
royalties segment royalties segment profitability millions of dollars year ended december change december change december royalty revenue gain on sale of royalty interest nm segment profit nm nm not meaningful revenues the majority of royalty revenue relates to sales of pegintron  a peg enhanced version of schering plough s now merck s alpha interferon product  intron a  which is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
other royalty revenues and certain licensing revenues relate to the application of our technology to third party products including those under a cross license agreement with nektar therapeutics  inc nektar under which we receive a share of the royalties and licensing income received by nektar 
there are currently two third party products for which nektar has granted sublicenses to our pegylation technology and for which we are participating in royalty and licensing income revenues ucb s cimzia for the treatment of crohn s disease and rheumatoid arthritis in the european union and osi and pfizer s macugen for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration 
for  we experienced a year over year decline in royalty revenues of percent 
royalty revenues from pegintron sales were down percent compared to levels due in part to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange variances and  in part to lower sales in the us and internationally 
royalties from pegasys  cimzia and macugen also decreased in compared to by contract  effective in october  we no longer derive royalties on sales of pegasys 
pegasys accounted for less than percent of total royalties in and approximately percent of total royalties 
cimzia was approved for sale in april for crohn s disease and in may for rheumatoid arthritis 
macugen continues to experience competition 
pegintron received a recommendation for approval as a treatment in addition to surgery in patients with metastatic melanoma from the us food and drug administration fda advisory committee 
however  in october  the fda issued a complete response letter to merck s supplemental biologics license application regarding pegintron for this indication 
merck has indicated it will work closely with the fda to respond to outstanding concerns related to the pegintron melanoma filing 
total royalty revenue in was million  down percent from the level 
royalties associated with pegintron were approximately percent lower than the prior year 
the decline reflects the sale during of a percent interest in the pegintron royalties partially offset by improvement in the underlying sales of the product 
pegintron experienced higher sales in international markets as well as a favorable impact from foreign exchange which was tempered by lower sales in japan and the us royalty growth from cimzia  pegasys and oncaspar in non us markets also bolstered revenues for the segment in the gain in on the sale of the percent interest in pegintron royalties  net of related costs  was million 
the purchaser of the royalty interest will be obligated to pay an additional million to us in the first quarter of if it achieves a certain threshold level of royalties on sales of pegintron occurring from july  through december  the million contingent gain will be recognized when and if the contingency is removed and collection is assured 
the future revenues to be received from the use of our technology are dependent upon numerous factors outside of our control such as competition and the effectiveness of marketing by our licensees 
these factors include the approval of new products that may compete with the products for which we receive royalties  new uses and geographies for pegintron and cimzia and changing competition 
costs and expenses current royalty revenues do not require any material specific administrative costs 
at some point in the future  costs associated with initiation of new out licensing agreements that could result in our receipt of a royalty stream and  if necessary  costs necessary to maintain the underlying technology may be charged to the royalties segment 
sale of specialty and potential future events the royalties segment was not part of the january sale of specialty to the sigma tau group 
certain specific royalties related to oncaspar sales in europe were divested of as part of that transaction  however 
the revenues generated from these contracts totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
see overview above 
as indicated in our current report on form k filed february   we are actively exploring the potential sale of all or a portion of the royalties we receive from pegintron  including through the preliminary solicitation of bids 
there can be no assurance as to the extent to which any such sale process will proceed or succeed  including whether any agreements will be reached or  if an agreement is reached  whether it will be consummated 
contract manufacturing segment contract manufacturing revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for cephalon for the european market  and through the first half of  the manufacture of an injectable multivitamin  mvi  for hospira  inc hospira 
contract manufacturing segment profitability millions of dollars year ended december change december change december revenues cost of sales general and administrative restructuring nm segment profit nm not meaningful revenues for the full year  contract manufacturing revenues were down percent to million 
the reduction in contract manufacturing revenues was primarily attributable to the lack of production of the injectable vitamin  mvi  during the latter half of the year 
other contract revenues were down as well 
our contract for mvi was scheduled to terminate effective april   however  we ceased processing of the product during the third quarter of due to a dispute with the customer and the customer s rejection of a number of batches 
abelcet for export and myocet both experienced lower volumes during the current year compared to the comparative decrease in year over year contract manufacturing revenue also was partly attributable to million of revenue recognized in for non routine services for design work for existing customers 
no comparable revenues were realized in contract manufacturing revenue for was percent or million higher than the revenues generated during contract manufacturing revenue in was favorably affected by million of compensation received in for certain non routine services and timing of shipments to our customers adversely affecting and having a favorable effect on 
cost of sales for the year ended december   contract manufacturing cost of sales as a percent of sales was approximately percent  significantly higher than the percent of sales experienced for the full year primarily as a result of the cancellations of the mvi shipments 
we provided reserves of approximately million and million against raw materials and finished goods inventories  respectively  of mvi during the third quarter of as a result of the cancellations of mvi shipments discussed above 
in addition  unfavorable variances related to the lack of processing of mvi adversely affected third quarter margins 
also  cost of sales for  as a percentage of sales  had been favorably affected by the above referenced non routine services which contributed million of revenues 
cost of sales for contract manufacturing for was million or approximately percent of sales compared to million or approximately percent of sales for cost of sales for  as a percentage of sales  was favorably affected by non routine services which contributed million of revenues 
in addition  cost of sales for was adversely affected by certain start up costs related to a new customer arrangement 
restructuring as a result of declining revenues in the contract manufacturing business and the imminent termination of the mvi contract see above  we took a number of actions during to control costs including  among other things  the elimination of temporary workers and a reduction in our manufacturing related workforce 
in connection with the reduction in manufacturing related workforce  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the third quarter of no additional charges are expected in connection with this reduction in force 
as of december   approximately million remained in accrued expenses which is expected to be fully paid out by the end of the third quarter of sale of specialty effective january   the contract manufacturing segment was sold to the sigma tau group 
see overview above 
non us revenue we had export sales and royalties recognized on export sales of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  sales in europe and royalties recognized on sales in europe were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our non us product sales and royalties are denominated in us dollars and are included in total revenues 
corporate and other expenses millions of dollars year ended december change december change december research and development general and administrative restructuring nm other income expense investment income  net interest expense other  net corporate and other expenses nm not meaningful research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation and benefits  contractor and consulting fees  principally related to clinical and regulatory projects  costs related to research and development partnerships or licenses  drug supplies for preclinical and clinical activities  as well as other research supplies and facilities charges 
research and development expenses related to currently marketed products are excluded from these corporate amounts and are reported in the products segment 
our research and development expense is considered a corporate expense until a product candidate enters phase iii clinical trials at which time related costs may be chargeable to an operating segment 
we continue to invest in research and development to build a differentiated oncology business through the development of our current portfolio of product candidates  reinforcing our position as a scientific leader in pegylation 
the following table summarizes our major research and development projects  including the costs incurred for the years ended december   and and the estimated completion dates of the current phase for each project in development millions of dollars 
for the year ended december  current phase of development estimated completion of current phase program costs peg sn phase ii hif alpha antagonist phase i survivin antagonist phase i additional lna targets preclinical ongoing rhmbl discontinued discontinued pegylation technology and other costs research preclinical ongoing total project costs for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased percent to million 
we invested in the following programs during peg sn we conducted two phase i clinical trials with peg sn in patients with solid tumors and lymphomas who have had been extensively treated with and progressed on other chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate different dosing schedules for peg sn these trials completed enrollment in the second quarter of results from these studies included findings that the recommended phase ii dose for this product candidate was mg m and that the product was safe and well tolerated by the patients 
therefore  in june  we started enrolling patients in a phase ii trial for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
this study is designed to evaluate two groups of colorectal patients who have failed two prior therapies  those with k ras mutation and those that have non mutated k ras tumors 
the study is expected to enroll approximately patients 
k ras mutation has been reported to occur in at least percent of patients with colorectal cancers 
the k ras mutation arm is expected to enroll up to patients 
the non mutated k ras group will be randomized into two arms  one treated with peg sn in combination with erbitux and the other treated with irinotecan in combination with erbitux 
as of february   we have enrolled patients  of which patients were k ras mutated 
in january  we started enrolling patients in a phase ii trial for patients with metastatic breast cancer 
the study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of single agent peg sn in two groups of patients who have received prior therapy regimens of anthracycline and taxane or anthracycline  taxane and xeloda 
irinotecan has been evaluated and shown to be active in patients with breast cancer 
all patients will be treated with single agent peg sn and our primary endpoint is response rate 
as of february   we have enrolled patients 
we also started enrollment in february in our phase i study for pediatric cancer patients 
this study is designed to find the recommended dose of peg sn in pediatric patients 
the start up costs related to the initiation of the two phase ii trials were the primary driver for the increase in expenditures related to this product candidate 
hif alpha antagonist we are currently conducting two phase i studies in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma to evaluate the safety of the hif alpha antagonist using two different dosing schedules 
we continue to enroll patients on a weekly and a daily schedule 
in general  hif alpha antagonist therapy has been well tolerated  and many patients have received multiple cycles with both the weekly and the daily administration regimen 
we have observed stable disease in a number of patients treated with our hif alpha antagonist 
tumor shrinkage was also seen in patients with renal cell cancer  liver cancer  sarcoma  and cancer of the tonsil 
we have recently amended the protocol to require patients to get repeated biopsies of cancer tumors now that biological activity is shown and higher doses are being given 
the data will allow us to confirm that the hif alpha is affecting the cancer target 
survivin antagonist the investigational new drug ind application for our survivin antagonist was accepted by the fda in february  triggering a million milestone payment 
we opened and started enrolling patients in a phase i study in february the study is designed to first treat patients with survivin as a single agent until progression and at such time that patient s treatment will be changed to survivin in combination with taxotere 
this allows us to gain dose and safety information both as a single agent and in combination in a single phase i study 
as of february   we had enrolled patients in this study 
additional lna targets under our agreement with santaris pharma a s santaris we will have the right to develop and commercialize rna antagonists directed against six additional novel oncology gene targets selected by us 
to date  we have received compounds directed at all six of our licensed targets 
we are evaluating these compounds in early preclinical studies 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a million milestone for the commencement of preclinical studies for one of our targets 
rhmbl although discontinued in  expenses were incurred during related to closure of clinical study sites and completion of patient study reports 
corporate research and development for was relatively unchanged from levels achieved during  declining approximately percent to million 
spending on contracted services related to the programs below during was somewhat less than that which was experienced during as included various start up costs 
partially offsetting the decline in contracted services during was a rise in share based compensation expense related to the vesting and amortization of grants made after adoption  in  of the current accounting rules related to such awards 
the following activities occurred during peg sn we continued to enroll patients in the phase i trials that were initiated in data from these trials were presented at the eortc meeting in hif alpha antagonist the fda accepted the ind for the hif alpha antagonist in during  we continued enrolling patients in our two phase i studies in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma to evaluate the safety of the hif alpha antagonist using two different dosing schedules 
contracted services for product supply decreased from to  as the supply needed for clinical trials was produced during start up costs for the initiation of the phase i trials were also incurred in survivin antagonist during  we completed the necessary preclinical and toxicology studies for the filing of the ind application 
this filing triggered a million milestone  once the application was accepted by the fda 
additional lna targets during we accepted four new lna compounds licensed from santaris 
rhmbl during  we decided to discontinue further development on the rhmbl program 
effective january   as part of the sale of specialty  in process research and development related to oncaspar and adagen was sold to the sigma tau group 
as part of a transition services agreement with the sigma tau group  we will provide resources to facilitate the transfer of certain technologies associated with oncaspar and adagen over the next few years 
the cost of these services  which have historically been reported in the products segment will no longer be reported as a segment expense beginning in we will be compensated by the sigma tau group based upon costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the transition services agreement 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of outside professional services for accounting  audit  tax  legal  and financing activities  salaries and benefits for support functions  patent filing fees and facilities costs 
general and administrative spending decreased percent to million in from million in both years expenses included certain costs associated with strategic initiatives million in and million in 
these initiatives related to preparations during to sell the specialty pharmaceutical business and analysis of various alternatives during general and administrative spending was lower in due in part to the benefits derived from the first quarter restructuring 
in addition  a fourth quarter adjustment was made to annual executive bonuses and a decision was made to satisfy these bonuses one half in cash and one half in nonvested shares that vest over the twelve months of the effect of this was to substantially reduce compensation expense 
offsetting these improvements were the cost of certain organizational and administrative enhancements  including the establishment of a business development function and the post implementation costs of a newly developed enterprise resource planning erp computer software system 
in addition  costs associated with the site at south plainfield  new jersey are being recognized in general and administrative expense previously included in cost of sales since production activities at that location ceased in late such costs include security  utilities  insurance and monthly rental related to the south plainfield facility 
in january  we entered into a sublease of the south plainfield facility under which we will receive rental income in excess of the rental expense being incurred under the original lease 
general and administrative expenses rose million or approximately percent in compared to the majority of the increase  approximately million  was related to our evaluation of strategic alternatives and improving our capital structure 
these costs  which included legal  accounting and professional fees  pertained in part to our study of possible alternative directions for the company including a spin off of our biotechnology activities  selling the specialty pharmaceutical business  or selling one or more of our marketed products and our indianapolis manufacturing facility 
we also undertook a solicitation of consent from holders of our convertible notes to amend the notes indenture and we commenced a tender offer for our notes in december other costs contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses included securing intellectual property rights for certain of our research and development efforts and incremental share based compensation to employees 
for a period of approximately three to four years after the july adoption of the current rules related to share based compensation  we experienced upward pressure on share based compensation expense as amortization of additional grants was layered into the computations 
as part of a transition services agreement with the sigma tau group  we will provide certain general  administrative  financial  legal  human resource and information technology services for various periods not to exceed one year 
we will be compensated by the sigma tau group for these services based upon costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the transition services agreement 
we may experience higher levels of general and administrative expense during than is expected to be the case in subsequent years 
in  we will continue to evaluate our general and administrative costs and the ongoing needs of our residual business 
restructuring corporate restructuring costs associated with the workforce reduction amounted to million during the first quarter of this represents severance and related costs of terminated employees in general and administrative areas as well as research and development 
the payments related to this charge were completed within the year and no accruals remained as of december  we may experience additional charges associated with the south plainfield lease or its termination prior to its contractual expiration in october in relation to the sale of specialty in january  certain employees who were related to specialty but who did not transfer to the employ of sigma tau group have been and will be separated from enzon 
additional severance related costs approximating million will be incurred during as a direct result 
during as we continue to evaluate the ongoing needs of the residual company  we may incur additional restructuring costs 
other income expense other income expense for the three years ended december   and was expense of million  expense of million and expense of million  respectively 
the repurchase and retirement of our notes and the remaining notes during the three years affected the year to year comparisons in a number of ways refer to liquidity and capital resources below 
net investment income in was lower than in by approximately million due to a reduction in the amount of investment holdings resulting from the use of proceeds from a portion of our investment holdings to repurchase notes payable 
in addition  interest rates were generally lower 
similarly  net investment income in was lower than in by approximately million due to a reduction in the amount of investment holdings during the year combined with lower interest rates 
outlays for retirement of debt amounted to million in and million in also  included in net investment income was a non cash million impairment write down in of one auction rate security 
interest expense includes amortization and  when debt is repurchased  write off  of deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense has declined over the three year period through  to million in from million in and million in this was due primarily to the refinancing and repayment of our and notes payable throughout this period 
as of december   we had million of principal amount of notes outstanding 
as of december   the notes outstanding amounted to million and as of december  we had million of notes as well as million of notes outstanding 
the write off of deferred debt issuance costs was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
significant portions of other income relate to gains realized on repurchase of notes payable 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased million principal amount of our notes at a discount to par yielding a gross gain of million reflected in other income  net 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of our notes at a discount to par yielding a gross gain of approximately million 
we also repurchased a portion of our notes early in at a gross gain of million 
losses related to asset disposals and foreign exchange partially offset the gains on repurchase of notes payable 
in  the repurchase of notes generated a gross gain of million 
in each case  the gross gains reflected here are exclusive of the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
income taxes in november  federal legislation was enacted under which we are able to carryback our alternative minimum tax net operating losses to the five previous years to offset the alternative minimum taxes that were not available to us for carryback prior to the new legislation 
we recorded the impact of the carryback  estimated to be approximately million  in the fourth quarter of and expect to receive a federal income tax cash refund in the first quarter of other legislation in allowed us to make an election to treat certain unused research and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as refundable in lieu of claiming bonus and accelerated depreciation for eligible qualified property placed in service through the end of this provided us with a million benefit in the balance of the income tax benefit reflects a reduction of million to foreign taxes payable due to a transfer price adjustment  canadian tax liabilities and an adjustment to taxes payable 
income tax expense in was primarily comprised of certain state and canadian taxes 
no federal income tax expense was incurred in relation to normal operating results due either to current period operating losses or the utilization of deferred tax assets to offset taxes that would otherwise accrue to operating income 
the million tax expense recorded in included a federal income tax provision for alternative minimum tax related to the gain on sale of a royalty interest recognized that year 
liquidity and capital resources cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities  totaled million as of december  and million as of december  cash utilized to acquire product rights and property and equipment and to repurchase notes and common stock outstanding more than offset cash generated through operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities during was million  down million from the most significant influence in this comparison is the fluctuations in operating asset and liability balances 
in  this represented a use of cash of approximately million  principally increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
in  decreases in accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by reductions in accounts payable constituted a net source of cash of approximately million 
earnings  adjusted for noncash items  in each year were relatively comparable 
operating activities provided cash of million in  a reduction of million compared to the million of operating cash flows in the million gain in from the monetization of a portion of pegintron royalties represented the primary difference between the two years 
changes in various balance sheet accounts comprised the difference a source of cash in of approximately million and a use of cash in of approximately million 
investing activities in included the million milestone payment to sanofi aventis that had been accrued for in as a result of oncaspar net sales in the us and canada having exceeded million for two consecutive years 
investments in property and equipment of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million made up the remaining uses of cash in cash was provided by investing activities in in the amount of million as a net amount of million of marketable securities matured or were liquidated and million was invested in plant and equipment 
the significant amount of cash derived from investments was used to repurchase our notes 
financing activities in  and related almost entirely to the repurchase and refinancing of our long term debt 
the repurchase of a portion of outstanding notes payable constituted a use of cash of million in  million in and million in in addition  we expended million during december to repurchase approximately  shares of the company s outstanding common stock pursuant to a share repurchase plan announced december  per the terms of this repurchase plan  we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common shares in order to return value to our shareholders 
subsequent to december  and through the time of filing of this report  an additional  shares were purchased at a cost of million 
the share repurchase program remains in effect 
as of december   the principal amount of the notes payable outstanding was million 
the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business constituted a fundamental change under the indenture for the notes  which triggered a requirement that we offer to purchase all of the notes at face value 
on february   we initiated a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the notes at face value 
the offer expired on march  with no notes having been tendered 
the fundamental change also triggered a change in the conversion rate from shares per  principal amount of notes to shares per  principal amount of notes during the period january  to march  during this period  million principal amount of the notes were converted into approximately million shares of our common stock  reducing the principal balance of the notes outstanding to million 
subsequent to the march  enhanced conversion period  the original conversion rate of shares per  principal amount is again in effect 
effective february   jeffrey buchalter  the company s president and chief executive officer  resigned from the company 
while final settlement terms remain under negotiation  mr 
buchalter may receive severance payments including certain insurance benefits of up to million which will be expensed during the first quarter of in addition  approximately  stock options   shares of restricted stock and  restricted stock units are subject to accelerated vesting as of his date of resignation  subject to certain conditions 
the acceleration of vesting of the share based awards constitutes a noncash charge to first quarter of approximately million 
our current sources of liquidity are our cash reserves  interest earned on such cash reserves and royalties primarily those related to sales of pegintron 
in january  we received approximately million net proceeds from the sale of specialty 
once our board of directors has determined the funding needs for the continuing operation of our business  some portion of the value derived from the sale of specialty may be returned to our stockholders 
based upon our current planned research and development activities and related costs  our current sources of liquidity and expected cash outflow from operations  we anticipate our current cash reserves will be sufficient to meet our capital and operational requirements for the near future 
while we believe that our current sources of liquidity will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operational needs for the near future  it is likely that we will need to obtain additional financing to sustain our research and development efforts prior to the time we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing  we may be required to curtail our research and development activities and or license our product candidates to third parties 
as indicated in our current report on form k filed february   we are actively exploring the potential sale of all or a portion of the royalties we receive from pegintron  including through the preliminary solicitation of bids 
there can be no assurance as to the extent to which any such sale process will proceed or succeed  including whether any agreements will be reached or  if an agreement is reached  whether it will be consummated 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spe  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet spe transactions 
our notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
at december   the potential dilutive effect of conversion of the notes was million shares using the conversion price of per share or shares per  principal amount of notes 
the sale of specialty in january constituted a fundamental change under the indenture agreement for the notes 
one effect of the fundamental change was the triggering of an enhanced conversion period for the notes  as defined in the notes indenture 
this period ran from january  to march  during this period  million principal amount of the notes was converted into approximately million shares of our common stock  reducing the principal amount of notes outstanding to million 
subsequent to the enhanced conversion period  the original conversion rate of shares per  principal amount is again in effect 
future potential dilution through conversion of the remaining notes would be approximately million shares if all remaining notes were converted 
in addition  stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share and million restricted stock units were outstanding at december   that represent additional potential dilution 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our notes payable  including interest  operating lease obligations and our license agreements with collaborative partners 
as of december   we had million of convertible senior unsecured notes outstanding 
these notes mature on june  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the notes rank equal to all future senior unsecured debt 
the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business in january constituted a fundamental change under the indenture agreement for the notes 
this triggered a requirement that we offer to purchase all of the notes at face value and it initiated a period of time during which the note holders could convert their holdings into shares of our common stock at an enhanced rate as defined in the indenture agreement 
the enhanced conversion rate triggered by this fundamental change was the average closing price per share of our common stock in the five trading day period prior to the closing of the sale of specialty 
no notes were tendered as a result of our february  tender offer which expired on march  during the enhanced conversion period of january  to march   notes in the amount of million were converted into approximately million shares of common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes reducing the outstanding principal balance of the notes outstanding to million 
subsequent to the enhanced conversion period  the original conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes is again in effect 
if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the date one day prior to the date of a notice of redemption is greater than percent of the applicable conversion price on the date of such notice  we  at our option  may redeem the notes in whole or in part  at a redemption price in cash equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued interest  if any  to the redemption date 
we lease three facilities in new jersey 
future minimum lease payments and commitments for operating leases total million at december  in january  we entered into a sublease of the south plainfield facility under which we will receive rental income in excess of the rental expense being incurred under the original lease 
none of these facilities was included in the january sale of assets of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
we had an exclusive license for the right to sell  market and distribute pacira s depocyt product 
all of our rights and obligations under this agreement with pacira were transferred to the sigma tau group in january as part of the sale of specialty 
in december  we entered into supply and license agreements with ovation 
pursuant to the agreements  ovation committed to supply and we committed to purchase specified quantities of the active ingredient used in the production of oncaspar during calendar years and additionally  ovation granted to us a non exclusive  fully paid  perpetual  irrevocable  worldwide license to the cell line from which such ingredient is derived 
all of our rights and obligations under this agreement with ovation were transferred to the sigma tau group in january as part of the sale of specialty 
in july  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with santaris pursuant to which we obtained exclusive rights worldwide  other than in europe  to develop and commercialize rna antagonists directed against the hif l alpha and survivin gene targets  as well as rna antagonists directed against six additional gene targets selected by us 
we will be responsible for making additional payments upon the successful completion of certain compound synthesis and selection  clinical development and regulatory milestones 
santaris is also eligible to receive royalties from any future product sales of products based on the licensed antagonists 
santaris retains the right to develop and commercialize products developed under the collaboration in europe 
this contractual arrangement was not part of the january sale of specialty 
contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents contractual cash obligations that continue to be the responsibility of enzon after the sale of specialty  aggregated by type as of december  in millions contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period total less than year years years more than years notes payable due june  operating lease obligations interest due on notes payable totals does not include potential milestone payments of million  primarily comprised of  million to santaris that are only payable upon successful development of all eight rna antagonists selected by us

as a result of the conversions that were effected subsequent to the sale of specialty  as of march   million principal amount of notes remain outstanding 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards effective as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenues revenues from product sales were recognized when title passed to the customer  generally at the time product was received 
for product sales  we recorded a provision at the time of shipment for estimated future credits  chargebacks  sales discounts  rebates and returns 
these sales provision accruals are presented as a reduction of the accounts receivable balances except for medicaid rebates and administrative fees which were recorded as a liability 
we recognized revenues for abelcet at the time of sale to the wholesaler 
sales of oncaspar and depocyt were recorded when product shipped by our third party distributor to the end user was received 
adagen was sold directly to a specialty distributor that then sold the product to end users 
we recognized revenue for adagen upon sale to the specialty distributor 
with respect to accruals for estimated medicaid rebates  we evaluated our historical rebate payments by product as a percentage of historical sales 
this information was used to estimate the proportion of revenue that would result in a rebate 
at the time of subsequent rebate payments  we recorded a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjusted accrued expenses for any differences between estimated and actual payments 
current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  and the percentage of our products that were sold to medicaid patients were also evaluated 
factors that complicated the rebate calculations were the timing of the average manufacturer pricing computation  the lag time between sale and payment of a rebate  which can range up to nine months  and the level of reimbursement by state agencies 
with respect to product returns  our policy was to accept as a return expired unopened product in its original package within six months after expiration 
in addition  we would accept returns for recalled or discontinued product 
on receipt of the returned product  we would issue a credit to the original purchaser of the product at actual invoice price with a corresponding reduction to the product return accrual 
at the end of each quarter we adjusted the product return accrual for any differences between the estimated and actual returns 
in accordance with the specifications mandated by the fda  as returned products had been out of our control  they were destroyed upon return and could not be resold 
product returns were accrued based on our estimate of the quantity expected to be returned at the invoice price 
our estimate was based on historical experience  projected future prescriptions of the products using historical prescription data and the amount and expiry of inventory estimated to be in the distribution channel  based on information obtained from our major customers 
we provided chargeback payments to the wholesalers based on their sales to members of buying groups at prices determined under a contract between ourselves and the member 
administrative fees were paid to buying groups based on the total amount of purchases by their members 
chargeback accruals were based on an estimate of claims not yet submitted by customers  using historical trends and market share data as well as the company s estimate of inventory in the distribution channel based on information obtained from its major customers which allowed us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the distribution channel 
the settlement of the chargebacks generally occurred within three months after the sale to the wholesaler 
we regularly analyzed the historical chargeback trends and made adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends 
in all cases  judgment was required in estimating these reserves and actual claims for rebates  returns and chargebacks could be materially different from the estimates 
we had entered into distribution service agreements with three of our largest customers 
we paid these customers a fixed percentage of revenues in exchange for certain distribution related services 
this expense was accrued at the time of sale to the customer and resulted in a reduction of the net revenues recorded by us 
the following is a summary of gross to net sales reductions that were accrued on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in thousands chargebacks cash discounts other including returns medicaid rebates medicaid administrative fees total balance at december  provision related to sales made in current year returns and credits balance at december  provision related to sales made in current year provision related to sales made in prior years returns and credits balance at december  reported as a reduction of accounts receivable 
reported as an accrued liability 
approximately percent and percent relates to abelcet in and  respectively 
certain wholesalers have claimed recovery of chargebacks relating to prior years 
we have established a reserve as of december  relates to sales made in the current year 
other than as disclosed in footnote above  there were no revisions to the estimates for gross to net sales adjustments that were material to income from operations for the year ended december  royalties under our license agreements with third parties are recognized when reasonably determinable and earned through the sale of the product by the licensee net of future credits  chargebacks  sales discount rebates and refunds and collection is reasonably assured 
notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement is the basis for royalty revenue recognition 
this information generally is received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
revenues from contract manufacturing were recognized when title passed to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
at the request of the customer  certain contract manufacturing arrangements involved the transfer of title of the finished product to the customer prior to shipment 
the product in question was manufactured to the unique specifications of the customer and could not be used to fill other orders 
if all necessary conditions were met  including the product was complete and ready for shipment  the risks of ownership had passed to the customer and the customer paid for storage of the product at our facility  we recognized revenue upon transfer of title 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned  upon the occurrence of contract specified events 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   we believe  based on projections  that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  including our net operating losses from operating activities and stock option exercises  will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not we will be able to sustain our position 
long lived asset impairment analysis long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present 
impairment indicators are events or circumstances that may be indicative of possible impairment such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  a current period operating loss combined with a history of operating losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
testing for the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is performed initially by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flow stream exceeds the carrying amount  no further analysis is required 
however  if this test shows a negative relationship  the fair value of the assets within the asset group must be determined and we would record an impairment charge for any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value 
these evaluations involve amounts and forecasts that are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
share based payments compensation cost  measured by the fair value of the equity instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is recognized in the financial statements as the respective awards are earned 
the impact that share based payment awards will have on our results of operations is a function of the number of shares awarded  vesting and the trading price and fair value of our stock at date of grant or modification 
fair value of share based payments is determined using the black scholes valuation model which employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of our stock  expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any 
expected volatility is based on our historical stock price information

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of debt securities and time deposits 
essentially all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
apart from custodial accounts related to the executive deferred compensation plan  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities 
we do not invest in commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings also are exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers the majority of which are rated a or better 
we typically invest the majority of our investments in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
the table below presents the amortized cost  fair value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our available for sale securities as of december  excluding primarily those related to our executive deferred compensation plan in thousands 
after total fair value fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our convertible senior unsecured notes in the principal amount of million at december  are due june  and have a fair value of million at december  our outstanding convertible notes have fixed interest rates 
accordingly  the fair values of the respective issuances will fluctuate as market rates of interest move up or down 
fair values are also affected by changes in the price of our common stock
