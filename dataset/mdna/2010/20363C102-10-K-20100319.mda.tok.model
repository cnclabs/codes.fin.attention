item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the preceding selected financial data and our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the financial information provided below has been rounded in order to simplify its presentation 
however  the ratios and percentages provided below are calculated using the detailed financial information contained in the financial statements  the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general we are a south carolina bank holding company headquartered in greenwood  south carolina with banking offices located in different cities throughout south carolina 
since our formation in  we have grown in our core markets through organic growth  and to expand our market presence from central south carolina to the upstate region of south carolina  we have made selective acquisitions and formed de novo banking operations 
we continuously evaluate our branch network to determine how to best serve our customers efficiently and to improve our profitability 
we operate a general commercial and retail banking business through our bank subsidiary  capitalbank  which we also refer to as our bank 
we believe our commitment to quality and personalized banking services is a factor that contributes to our competitiveness and success 
through capitalbank  we provide a full range of lending services  including real estate  consumer and commercial loans to individuals and small to medium sized businesses in our market areas  as well as residential mortgage loans 
our primary focus has been on real estate construction loans  commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans 
we complement our lending services with a full range of retail and commercial banking products and services  including checking  savings and money market accounts  certificates of deposit  credit card ac counts  individual retirement accounts safe deposit accounts  money orders and electronic funds transfer services 
in addition to our traditional banking services  we also offer customers trust and fiduciary services 
we make discount securities brokerage services available through a third party brokerage service that has contracted with capitalbank 
like most community banks  we derive the majority of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments 
our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income earned on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense cost of our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of these measures 
for example  the average balances table shows the average balance during and of each category of our assets and liabilities  as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category 
a review of this table shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earning assets  which is why we intend to channel a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included a table to help explain this 
finally  we have included a number of tables that provide detail ab out our investment securities  our loans  and our deposits and other borrowings 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings 
in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers 
we describe the various components of this non interest income  as well as our non interest expenses  in the following discussion 
markets in the united states and elsewhere have experienced extreme volatility and disruption for more than months 
these circumstances have exerted significant downward pressure on prices of equity securities and virtually all other asset classes  and have resulted in substantially increased market volatility  severely constrained credit and capital markets  particularly for financial institutions  and an overall loss of investor confidence 
loan portfolio performances have deteriorated at many institutions resulting from  among other factors  a weak economy and a decline in the value of the collateral supporting their loans 
dramatic slowdowns in the housing industry with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment have created strains on financial institutio ns 
many borrowers are now unable to repay their loans  and the collateral securing these loans has  in some cases  declined below the loan balance 
the following discussion and analysis describes our performance in this challenging economic environment 
the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included in this report

criticized and classified loans have decreased from million at december  to million at december  we diligently monitor and manage our loan portfolio to identify problem loans at the earliest possible point 
as the economy deteriorated during and  we aggressively rated any cre dits with signs of deterioration in quality  which resulted in the increase in criticized and classified loans and heightened provision expense 
total loans decreased million during  or  to million at december  from million at december we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million in  compared to no charges for the same period in we reevaluated our goodwill impairment testing as of december  given the substantial declines in our common stock price  declining operating results  asset quality trends  market comparables and the economic outlook for our industry  the results of our testing indicated the need for this charge 
we realized an increase in fdic banking assessments of million  or  to million in from  in the increase was primarily resulting from increases in fdic insurance premiums and a one time fdic insurance assessment of  due to the recession of the us economy and the recent failure of several unaffiliated fdic insured depository institutions 
we incurred one time expenses of  during associated with the early termination of fhlb borrowings 
we incurred million in expenses associated with write downs on other real estate owned during  compared to  during the increase is due to our increase in foreclosures and significant continued declines in fair values of real estate 
we have included a more detailed discussion  including tabular presentations  of noninterest income and noninterest expense in the years ended december  and under the heading noninterest income and expense located in this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the combination of the above factors resulted in net losses of  for  compared to net income of  for  a decrease of  basic earnings loss per share was in  compared to in diluted earnings loss per share was in  compared to in return on average assets during was compared to during  and return on average equity was during compared to during net interest income general 
the largest component of our net income is our net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the yields earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average interest earning assets represents our net interes t margin 
net interest income continued we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of various measures of our financial performance 
for example  the average balances table shows the average balance of each category of our assets liabilities as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category during and a review of these tables shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earning assets  which is why we direct a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
similarly  the rate volume analysis table helps demonstrate the effect of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities on our financial condition during the periods shown 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included tables to illustrate our interest rate sensitivity with respect to interest earning accounts and interest bearing accounts 
finally  we have included various tables that provide detail about our investment securities  our loans  our deposits  and other borrowings 
average balances  income and expenses  and rates 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average balance sheet and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated

net interest income continued our tax effected net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  the decline in net interest margin was primarily due to our increased level of nonaccrual loans and our desire to maintain cash liquidity 
for the year ended december   earning assets averaged million compared to million for the year ended december  interest earning assets exceeded interest bearing liabilities by million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   our tax effected net interest income  the major component of our net income  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the average rate realized on interest earning assets decreased to at december   from at december   while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to at december   from at december  our tax effected interest income for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of million on loans  million on investments  and  on interest bearing deposits with correspondent banks

analysis of changes in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the effect that the varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates have had on changes in net interest income from to analysis of changes in net interest income compared with compared with variance due to variance due to dollars in thousands volume rate total volume rate total earning assets loans securities  taxable securities  nontaxable nonmarketable equity securities federal funds sold and other total interest income interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts savings accounts time deposits total interest bearing deposits other short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances junior subordinate debt total interest expense net interest income volume rate changes have been allocated to each category based on the percentage of the total change 
net interest income continued interest sensitivity 
we monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on our net interest income 
the principal monitoring technique we employ is the measurement of our interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity  or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
the following table sets forth our interest rate sensitivity at december  interest sensitivity analysis greater after one after three than one within through through within year december  one three twelve one or non dollars in thousands month months months year sensitive total assets earning assets loans securities federal funds sold and other total earning assets liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total interest bearing deposits other short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap ratio of cumulative gap to total earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans and includes loans held for sale 
the above table reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their repricing or maturity dates 
overnight federal funds are reflected at the earliest pricing interval due to the immediately available nature of the instruments 
debt securities are reflected at each instrument s ultimate maturity date 
scheduled payment amounts of fixed rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date 
scheduled payment amounts of variable rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date until the loan may be repriced contractually  the unamortized balance is reflected at that point 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts  are reflected in the earliest repricing period due to contractual arrangements that give us the opportunity to vary the rates paid on those deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
fixed rate time deposits  principally certificates of deposit  are reflected at their contractual maturity date 
other short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
federal funds purchased are reflected at the earliest pricing interval because funds can be repriced daily 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the maturity date of each repurchase agreement that generally matures within one day 
advances from the federal home loan bank are reflected at their contractual maturity dates 
junior subordinated debentures are reflected at their contractual maturity date 
net interest income continued we generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when we have an asset sensitive gap position and generally would benefit from decreasing market rates of interest when we are liability sensitive 
our net interest margin continues to be negatively impacted by the increase in the level of nonaccrual loans and the desire to maintain cash liquidity 
we are liability sensitive within the one year period 
however  our gap analysis is not a precise indicator of our interest sensitivity position 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portio n of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those rates are viewed by us as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  we believe a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of our true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization that depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
provision and allowance for loan losses general 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we have developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of our credit portfolio and the timely identification of potential problem credits 
the board of directors reviews and approves the appropriate level for capitalbank s allowance for loan losses quarterly based upon management s recommendations  the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in our markets  and a review of historical statistical data for both us and other financial institutions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan losses on our income statement  are periodically made to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan portfolio 
loan losses  which include write downs and charge offs  and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
our allowance for loan losses is based upon judgments and assumptions of risk elements in the portfolio  future economic conditions  and other factors affecting borrowers 
the process includes identification and analysis of loss potential in various portfolio segments utilizing a credit risk grading process and specific reviews and evaluations of significant problem credits 
in addition  we monitor overall portfolio quality through observable trends in delinquency  charge offs  and general and economic conditions in the service area 
risks are inherent in making all loans  including risks with respect to the period of time over which loans may be repaid  risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions  risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers  and  in the c ase of a collateralized loan  risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral 
in developing our asc general reserve estimate  we have segmented the loan portfolio into risk categories consumer loans  home equity lines  overdraft protection lines  residential loans  commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  cash secured loans  mortgages held for resale  government guaranteed portions of loans  and demand deposit account dda overdrafts 
loss experience on each of the risk categories is compiled over the previous three year period 
from this segmentation  we have identified several homogeneous pools and applied the corresponding three year loss factor for the reserve allocation 
the homogeneous pools we have identified include consumer installment loans  home equity lines of credit  overdraft protection lines  cash secured loan s  mortgages held for resale  government guaranteed portions of loans  and dda overdrafts in excess of days 
the remaining segments of the loan portfolio  which include residential loans  commercial loans  and commercial real estate loans  are analyzed with the entire loan portfolio for progressions through our risk rating system 
we then apply the results generated from the three year historical loss migration analysis to each of these segments 
when a particular loan is identified as impaired  it is removed from the corresponding segment and individually analyzed and measured for specific reserve allocation 
qualitative and environmental factors include external risk factors that we believe are representative of our overall lending environment 
we have identified the following factors in establishing a more comprehensive system of controls in which we can monitor the quality of the loan portfolio portfolio risk loan policy  procedures and monitoring risk national and local economic trends and conditions concentration risk acquisition and development loan portfolio risks impaired loan portfolio additional risks provision and allowance for loan losses continued certain problem loans are reviewed individually for impairment 
an impaired loan may not represent an expected loss  however a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining if a loan is impaired  the bank considers all non accrual loans  loans whose terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring  and any other loan that is individually evaluated and determined to be impaired based on risk ratings and loan amounts of certain segments of the bank s loan portfolio 
if a loan is individually evaluated and identified as impaired  it is measured by using either the fair value of the collateral  less expected costs to sell  present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loans effective interest rate  or observable market price of the loan 
management chooses a method on a loan by loan basis 
measuring impaired loans requires judgment and estimates and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 
total provision expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in provision expense during was primarily due to the decrease in market valuations on nonaccrual and impaired loans 
additionally  the increase in provision was due to the increase in net charge offs to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses was of total loans at december  compared to at december  based on present information and an ongoing evaluation  management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to meet presently known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  underlying assumptions may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers  which was not known to management at the time of the issuance of the company s consolidated financial statements 
therefore  management s assumptions may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required  especially consider ing the overall weakness in the real estate market in our market areas 
additionally  no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio  in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant factors  will not require significant future additions to the allowance for loan losses  thus adversely impacting the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows

provision and allowance for loan losses continued the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our allowance for loan losses and the composition of charge offs and recoveries for each of the last five years

the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets for the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans days or more past due and still accruing interest impaired loans still accruing interest nonperforming assets to period end assets accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest that has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  we may ultimately write down or charge off the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to earnings 
for all periods presented  the additional interest income  which would have been recognized into earnings if our nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  is immaterial 
total nonperforming assets totaled million at december  and million at december  this amount consists primarily of nonaccrual loans that totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
nonperforming assets were of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december  a significant portion  or  of nonperforming loans at december  were secured by real estate 
we have evaluated the underlying collateral on these loans and believe that the collateral on these loans is sufficient to minimize future losses 
however  the recent downturn in the real estate market has resulted in increased loan delin quencies  defaults and foreclosures  and we believe that these trends are likely to continue 
in some cases  this downturn has resulted in a significant impairment to the value of the collateral used to secure these loans and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
these conditions have adversely affected our loan portfolio 
the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
if real estate provision and allowance for loan losses continued values continue to decline  it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses 
if during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the property collateralizing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase the allowance for loan losses  this could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
potential problem loans 
at december   through our internal review mechanisms  we had identified million of criticized loans and million of classified loans 
the results of this internal review process are the primary determining factor in our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
our criticized loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  total classified loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  the million decrease in criticized and classified loans from december  to december  were primarily due to real estate development and single family construction loans  all of which are secured by real estate 
during  we enhanced our internal review and monitoring processes and procedures to assist in identifying potential credit risks and implementation of action plans early on to minimize total portfolio risk and potential loan losses

noninterest income increased  or  to million in from million in service charges on deposit accounts decreased  or  to million in from million in gains on sales of loans held for sale increased  or  to million in from million in income from fiduciary activities decreased  or  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily a result of the decline in the market value of assets under management

we realized an increase in fdic banking assessments of million  or  to million in from  in the increase was primarily resulting from increases in fdic insurance premiums and a one time fdic insurance assessment of  due to the recession of the us economy and the recent failure of several unaffiliated fdic insured depository institutions 
we incurred one time expenses of  during associated with the early termination of fhlb borrowings 
we incurred million in expenses associated with write downs on other real estate owned during  compared to  during the increase is due to our increase in foreclosures and significant continued declines in fair values of real estate 
other operating expenses decreased  or  to million in from million in effective july   we eliminated bank and holding company director fees  which has resulted in cost savings 
we intend to continue our efforts in controlling and eliminating noninterest expenses

the decline in the effective tax rate resulted from a lower percentage of pretax income being derived from tax free sources 
earning assets loans 
loans are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or

financial institutions in our market areas typically obtain a security interest in real estate  whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
real estate construction loans decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential mortgage loans  which is the largest category of our loans  decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential real estate loans consist of first and second mortgages on single or multi family residential dwellings 
nonresidential mortgage loans  which include commercial loans and other loans secured by multi family properties and farmland  decreased million or  to million at december  from million at december  commercial and industrial loans decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  consumer and other loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  our loan portfolio reflects the diversity of our markets 
our full service branches and one stand alone drive through are located from the northern midlands of south carolina through the upstate 
primary market areas include abbeville  anderson  belton  clemson  clinton  greenville  greenwood  newberry and saluda 
the economies of these markets are varied and represent different industries including medium and light manufacturing  higher education  regional health care  and distribution facilities 
these areas are expected to remain stable with continual growth 
the diversity of the economy creates opportunities for all types of lending 
we do not engage in foreign lending 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is also a source of our liquidity 
due to the current economic downturn  all contractual maturities may not parallel actual payoffs due to the inability of borrowers to repay their loans 
the following table sets forth our loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates over one year december  one year through over five dollars in thousands or less five years years total commercial and industrial real estate consumer and other loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates floating interest rates the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  we believe this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio shown in the above table 
earning assets continued investment securities 
the investment securities portfolio is a significant component of our total earning assets 
total securities averaged million in  compared to million in at december   the total securities portfolio was million  a decrease of million  or over total securities of million at december  securities designated as available for sale totaled million and were recorded at estimated fair value 
securities designated as held to maturity totaled  and were recorded at amortized cost 
the securities portfolio also includes nonmarketable equity secu rities totaling million which are carried at cost because they are not readily marketable or have no quoted market value 
these include investments in federal reserve bank stock  federal home loan bank stock  community capital corporation statutory trust i  and the stock of one unrelated financial institution 
the following table sets forth the book value of the securities held by us at the dates indicated 
book value of securities december  dollars in thousands government sponsored enterprises obligations of state and local governments mortgage backed securities nonmarketable equity securities total securities the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and average yields of securities held at december  investment securities maturity distribution and yields after one but after five but december  within one year within five years within ten years over ten years dollars in thousands amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield government sponsored enterprises obligations of state and local governments total securities excludes mortgage backed securities totaling million with a yield of and nonmarketable equity securities 
the yield on state and local governments is presented on a tax equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 
we review our investment portfolio at least quarterly and more frequently when economic conditions warrant  assessing whether there is any indication of other than temporary impairment otti 
factors considered in the review include  without limitation  estimated cash flows  length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain the security to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value 
if the review determines that there is otti  then an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made  or may recognize a portion in other comprehensive income 
the fair value of investments on which otti is recognized then becomes the new cost basis of the investment 
other attributes of the securities portfolio  including yields and maturities  are discussed above in net interest income interest sensitivity 
short term investments 
short term investments  which consist primarily of our cash held in our federal reserve correspondent account  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks  averaged million in  compared to  in at december   short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  the reason for the increase was primarily due to our desire to maintain more on balance sheet liquidity and a change made effective in november by the federal reserve bank to pay interest on balances held in our account  which resulted in changes to our daily funds management w ith the federal reserve bank

our core deposits increased million from million at december  to million at december  the largest increase in our core deposits was in demand deposit accounts  which increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  our non interest bearing deposits have increased due to our successful rollout of significantly improved cash management services and the movement of funds from customer repurchase agreements to bank deposits taking advantage of unlimited de posit insurance 
our money market accounts increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  deposits  and particularly core deposits  have historically been our primary source of funding and have enabled us to meet successfully both our short term and long term liquidity needs 
we anticipate that such deposits will continue to be our primary source of funding in the future 
our brokered deposits at december  totaled million  which represented of our entire deposit base 
all of our brokered deposits at december  were brokered time deposit accounts 
as of december   all of our brokered deposits were brokered money market accounts 
during  we eliminated our brokered money market deposits and replaced them with longer term brokered cds 
while we do not anticipate that brokered cds will be a material part o f our funding base  we will continue to use this funding source as long as it provides a significantly lower cost of funds versus in market deposits 
our loan to deposit ratio was at december   and at the end of the maturity distribution of our time deposits of  or more at december  is set forth in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more after six within after three through after three through six twelve twelve dollars in thousands months months months month total certificates of deposit of  or more deposits and other interest bearing liabilities continued approximately of our time deposits of  or more had scheduled maturities within six months and had maturities within twelve months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist of short term borrowings  advances from the federal home loan bank  junior subordinated debentures and our correspondent bank line of credit 
short term borrowings are primarily federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
average short term borrowings were million in  a decrease of million from million in federal reserve discount window and term auction facility taf borrowings averaged million in at december   we had no borrowings under our line with federal reserve 
federal funds purchased from correspondent banks averaged million in at december   we had no federal funds purchased 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged million in at december   we had no securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
average federal home loan bank advances during were million compared to million during  a decrease of million 
advances from the federal home loan bank are collateralized by one to four family residential mortgage loans  multi family residential loans  home equity lines and commercial real estate loans 
at december   borrowings from the federal home loan bank were million compared to million a year earlier 
during  our cash levels increased as a result of growing our deposits 
we utilized the cash generated from deposit growth at relatively lower rates versus the federal home loan bank advances to prepay three advances totaling million  effectively lowering our overall ongoing borrowing costs 
 we incurred one time expenses of  during associated with the early termination of fhlb borrowings 
although we expect to continue using short term borrowings and federal home loan bank advances as secondary funding sources  core deposits will continue to be our primary funding source

average junior subordinated debentures during were million 
in january  we announced the decision to defer future interest payments on our trust preferred subordinated debt for the foreseeable future to maintain cash levels at the parent company 
the following table summarizes our various sources of borrowed funds for the years ended december  and these borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal funds purchased  advances from the federal home loan bank  and junior subordinated debentures 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature on a one to seven day basis 
these agreements are secured by government sponsored enterprise securities 
federal funds purchased are short term borrowings from other financial institutions that mature daily 
advances from federal home loan bank mature at different periods as discussed in the footnotes to the financial st atements and are secured by capitalbank s one to four family residential mortgage loans  home equity lines and commercial real estate loans

under the risk based standard  capital is classified into two tiers 
our tier capital consists of common shareholders equity  excluding the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities  minus intangible assets 
our tier capital consists of the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations 
a bank holding company s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk based capital ratio consists of the sum of its tier and tier capital 
the regulatory minimum requ irements are for tier and for total risk based capital 
the company and capitalbank are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on average total assets  which is known as the leverage ratio 
only the strongest bank holding companies and banks are allowed to maintain capital at the minimum requirement of 
all others are subject to maintaining ratios to above the minimum 
to provide the additional capital needed to support our bank s growth in assets in  we issued million in junior subordinated debentures in connection with our trust preferred securities offering 
on september   we completed a rights offering to shareholders and standby purchasers 
through the offering  we issued  shares of common stock  representing  in new capital  net of expenses  in connection with the rights offering 
the remaining  unsubscribed shares were offered to the public through october   at the subscription rate of per share 
the company raised an aggregate of  net of expenses  in new capital in the rights offering  the public offering  and employee purchases through our k plan purchased through treasury shares  of which  was raised in the public offering 
beginning in  our k plan and dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan began to purchase shares from treasury versus the open market to generate additional capital 
in  we issued  shares of treasury stock to these plans for total proceeds of  of this amount   were purchased as part of the capital raise noted above

liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  we would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities we serve 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
our loans to assets ratio decreased from to and our loans to funds ratio decreased from to the loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   and the loans to funds ratio at december  was compared to at december  the amount of advances from the federal home loan bank were approximately million at december  compared to million at december  we expect to continue using these advances as a source of funding 
during  we formally established a line with the federal reserve bank s discount window 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding and had the ability to receive million in funds under the terms of our agreement with the federal reserve bank 
additionally  we had approximately million of unused lines of credit for federal funds purchases and million of securities available for sale at december  as sources of liquidity 
we also have the ability to receive an additional million in advances under the terms of our agreement with the federal home loan bank 
we depend on dividends from capitalbank as our primary source of liquidity 
the ability of capitalbank to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions that may have a material impact on the liquidity available to us 
we paid stock dividends in september  june  may  and november and may do so in the future 
we paid cash dividends on a quarterly basis from the third quarter of through the first quarter of in april  we announced we were suspending our quarterly cash dividends to preserve our retained capital and because of regulatory concerns 
our future dividends are subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition  cash req uirements  and general business conditions 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with such principals requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we  in conjunction with our independent auditors  have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates discussed herein with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures herein 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
of these significant accounting policies  we consider our policies regarding the accounting for the allowance for loan losses  benefit plans  mortgage servicing rights  accounting for past acquisitions  and income taxes  to be the most critical accounting policies due to the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of these financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying these balances 
accounting for these critical areas requires a significant degree of judgment that could be subject to revision as newer information becomes available 
in order to determine our critical accounting policies  we consider whether the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
see provision and allowance for losses for additional discussion including factors impacting the allowance and the methodology for analyzing the adequacy of the allowance 
this methodology relies upon our judgment 
our judgments are based on an assessment of various issues  including  but not limited to  the pace of loan growth  emerging portfolio concentrations  the risk management system relating to lending activities  entry into new markets  new product offerings  loan portfolio quality trends  and uncertainty in current economic and business conditions 
we consider the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio 
however  our judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about current events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio  in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances  will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely impacting the results of operations of the company 
we believe the accounting for other real estate owned oreo is a critical accounting policy that requires judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
oreo is initially recorded at fair value  less any costs to sell 
if the fair value  less cost to sell at the time of foreclosure  is less than the loan balance  the deficiency is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
if the fair value  less cost to sell  of the oreo decreases during the holding period  a valuation allowance is established with a charge to foreclosed property costs 
when the oreo is sold  a gain or loss is recognized on the sale for the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property 
financed sales of or eo are accounted for in accordance with asc  real estate sales 
we use assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year  deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns  and income tax expense 
determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
we exercise considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments and estimates are reevaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
no assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by us or the income tax reported on the consolidated financial statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings by the united stat es tax court  changes in the tax code  or assessments made by the internal revenue service 
we are subject to potential adverse adjustments  including  but not limited to  an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates  the permanent nondeductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods  and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income  including capital gains  in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets 
historically  our estimated income taxes have been materially correct  and we are not aware of any reason that a material change will occur in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein that summarizes current period income tax expense as well as future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expenses and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes 
non gaap financial information this report contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with gaap 
we use these non gaap measures to analyze performance 
such disclosures include  but are not limited to  certain designated net interest income amounts presented on a tax equivalent basis 
we believe that the presentation of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis aids in the comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources 
these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap measures  and furthermore  our non gaap measures may not necessarily be comparable to non gaap performance measures of other companies 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and capitalbank are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
impact of off balance sheet instruments we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer at predetermined interest rates as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
a commitment involves  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the contractual amount of the instrument 
because certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as other lending facilities 
standby letters of credit often expire without being used 
we use the same credit underwriting procedures for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit as we do for our on balance sheet instruments 
the credit worthiness of each borrower is evaluated and the amount of collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
we are not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments or that could significantly impact earnings 
through its operations  capitalbank has made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of its business activities 
these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to capitalbank s customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time 
at december   capitalbank had issued commitments to extend credit of million and standby letters of credit of million through various types of commercial lending arrangements 
approximately million of these commitments to extend credit had variable rates 
our experience has been that a significant portion of these commitments often expire without being used 
the following table sets forth the length of time until maturity for unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit at december  after one after three through through greater within one three twelve within one than dollars in thousands month months months year one year total unused commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit totals the bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by capitalbank upon extension of credit  is based on its credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plants  equipment and commercial and residential real estate
