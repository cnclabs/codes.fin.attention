item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our strategy regency centers corporation the parent company began its operations as a real estate investment trust reit in and is the managing general partner in regency centers  lp the operating partnership 
the term the company or regency means the parent company and the operating partnership  collectively 
our key strategic goals are focused on total share and unit holder return in excess of peer indices and sustaining growth in net asset value and earnings 
we will achieve these goals through owning  operating and investing in a high quality portfolio of primarily grocery anchored shopping centers that are tenanted by market dominant grocers  category leading anchors  specialty retailers  and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities 
all of our operating  investing  and financing activities are performed through the operating partnership  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as co investment partnerships or joint ventures 
the parent company currently owns of the outstanding common partnership units of the operating partnership 
because of our structure and certain public debt financing  the operating partnership is also a registrant 
at december   we directly owned shopping centers the consolidated properties located in states representing million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
our cost of these shopping centers and those under development is billion before depreciation 
through co investment partnerships  we own partial ownership interests in shopping centers the unconsolidated properties located in states and the district of columbia representing million square feet of gla 
our investment in the partnerships that own the unconsolidated properties is million 
certain portfolio information described below is presented a on a combined basis  which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties  b for our consolidated properties only and c for the unconsolidated properties that we own through co investment partnerships 
we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we wholly own versus those that we indirectly own through entities we do not control  but for which we provide asset management  property management  leasing  investing  and financing services 
the shopping center portfolio that we manage  on a combined basis  represents shopping centers located in states and the district of columbia and contains million square feet of gla 
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores  major retail anchors  side shop retailers  and restaurants  including ground leasing or selling building pads out parcels to these same types of tenants 
historically  we have experienced growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers  and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 
our shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services 
this high traffic generates increased sales  thereby driving higher occupancy and rental rate growth  which we expect will provide sustained growth in earnings per share and unit and net asset value over the long term 
we seek a range of strong national  regional and local specialty retailers  for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs 
we have created a formal partnering process  the premier customer initiative pci  to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our side shop retailers 
the objective of pci is for us to build a base of non anchor tenants who represent the best in class operators in their respective merchandising categories 
such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center s anchor  help grow and stabilize a center s occupancy  reduce re leasing downtime  reduce tenant turnover  and yield higher sustainable rents 
the recession that ended in had a significant negative impact on our operating results 
during we experienced less tenant demand for vacant space as well as a higher level of retail store closings  although the rate of closure appears to be slowing 
our rent collection losses increased in most 
table of contents of our shopping centers and markets  as we experienced a higher level of tenants defaulting on their leases  a result of lower retail sales 
these factors contributed to a decline in our occupancy percentages  new leasing rental rates  and rental revenues 
at december  our operating portfolio of shopping centers including our pro rata share of our co investment partnerships  were leased as compared to at the end of and leased at the end of increasing occupancy in our shopping centers to historical levels of is a key objective of our strategic plan that should generate substantial growth in our future earnings and net asset value  but will likely require several years to accomplish 
we continue to closely monitor tenants who have co tenancy clauses in their lease agreements 
these tenants are typically located in larger format community shopping centers that contain multiple anchor tenants whose leases contain these types of clauses 
co tenancy clauses have several variants they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their store  they may allow a tenant the opportunity to close their store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes their store prior to lease expiration  or more commonly  they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center 
as the weak economy continues to depress retail sales  we could experience further reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their co tenancy clauses 
during we experienced a higher tenant default rate as compared to previous years due to a national decline in retail sales 
these defaults were primarily local tenants  which are generally defined as tenants operating five or fewer stores  such as restaurants  fitness centers  dry cleaners  and tanning salons 
we are closely monitoring the operating performance  collections  and sales of all of the tenants in our shopping centers especially those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition  business practice  reductions in sales  and store closings in other locations 
we expect that as the current economy remains weak  additional retailers will announce store closings and or bankruptcies that could negatively impact our shopping centers 
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and shopping center development 
we will continue to use our unique combination of development capabilities  market presence  and anchor relationships to invest in value added opportunities sourced from distressed owners  the redevelopment of existing centers  developing land that we already own  and other opportunities 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers  resulting in modern shopping centers with long term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process typically requires three to five years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up  and stabilization of rental income  but can take longer depending upon tenant demand for new stores and the size of the project 
in the near term  fewer new store openings by retailers are resulting in reduced demand for new retail space and causing corresponding reductions in new leasing rental rates and development pre leasing 
as a result  we have scaled back our development program by decreasing the number of new projects started  phasing existing developments that lack retail demand  and decreasing overhead costs through reductions in force 
although our development program will continue to play a part of our long term business strategy  new development projects will be rigorously evaluated in regard to the cost and availability of capital  visibility of tenant demand to achieve a stabilized occupancy  and sufficient investment returns 
we strive to maintain a conservative capital structure 
we will continue to cost effectively and opportunistically strengthen our balance sheet  which should allow us to access various sources of capital to fund our future commitments 
we endeavor to continue improving our key financial ratios and to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets of our consolidated real estate assets at december  are unencumbered 
such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and maintain significant availability on our million line of credit commitment  which had no outstanding balance at december  our debt to asset ratio before the effect of accumulated depreciation  including our pro rata share of the debt and assets of joint ventures is at december  
table of contents  which is favorably lower than our ratio at december  of 
if we were to repay a portion of our outstanding debt with our available cash balances  our current debt to asset ratio would fall to at december  for the year ended  our coverage ratio with our pro rata share of our partnerships declined to times as compared to times in  directly related to a reduction in our ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  which was negatively impacted by the recent recession 
we define our coverage ratio as ebitda divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders 
during  standard and poor s rating services lowered our corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bbb primarily due to the decline in our coverage ratio and a negative retail outlook 
we plan to grow ebitda through growth in net operating income by returning the occupancy percentages in our shopping centers back to historic levels and by acquiring or developing shopping centers  which in combination with a conservative capital structure should favorably impact our coverage ratio on a long term basis 
capital recycling involves contributing shopping centers to co investment partnerships and culling non strategic assets from our real estate portfolio and selling those in the open market 
these sales proceeds are either reserved for future capital commitments related to in process development  redevelopments or debt maturities  or re deployed into even higher quality new developments or acquisitions that will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns 
to the extent that we are unable to generate capital in excess of our current commitments  we will reduce our new investment activity accordingly 
co investment partnerships provide us with a reliable capital source for shopping center acquisitions  as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset management  property management  and other investing and financing services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co investment partnerships as those applied to the portfolio that we wholly own 
co investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us 
although selling properties to co investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest  it provides a source of capital that further strengthens our balance sheet while we continue to share  to the extent of our ownership interest  in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long term investment strategy 
our co investment partnerships have significant levels of debt that mature through and are subject to significant borrowing risks if the capital markets again become unavailable as they were during the recent recession 
as a result of the declines in commercial real estate values over the past months  the refinancing of maturing loans will require us and our joint venture partners to each contribute our respective pro rata share of capital to the joint ventures in order to reduce the amount of borrowing to acceptable loan to value levels which we expect will be required for new financings 
while we have to date successfully refinanced our maturing loans  the weak us economy may hinder our ability to access capital  including access by our joint venture partners  or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt 
while we believe that our joint venture partners have sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital requirements  we can provide no assurance that the weak economy will not inhibit their ability to access capital and meet their future funding commitments 
the impact to the company of a co investment partner defaulting on its share of a capital call is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources

in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues and tenant receivables 
we are closely monitoring industry trends and sales data to help us identify declines in retail categories or tenants who might be experiencing financial difficulties as a result of slowing sales  lack of credit  changes in retail formats or increased competition 
as a result of our findings  we may reduce new leasing  suspend leasing  or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer 
as of december   we had video rental stores occupying our shopping centers on a combined basis that represent million of annual base rent on a pro rata basis 
blockbuster video represents the majority of our video rental leases with stores and annual base rent of million or of our annualized base rent including our pro rata share of stores in the unconsolidated properties 
blockbuster has announced publicly that it will close many of its stores and we expect that during they will close some of the stores that they occupy in our shopping centers 
movie gallery hollywood video filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on february  we currently have four movie gallery hollywood video stores occupying our shopping centers and we anticipate that these stores could close during the base rent associated with these four stores is insignificant to our annual base rent on a pro rata basis

of these leases  none have been assumed and leases have been rejected 
the combined annual 
table of contents base rent on a pro rata basis associated with these leases is approximately million or less than of our annual base rent on a pro rata basis 
we continue to monitor and communicate with those tenants who have announced store closings or are experiencing financial distress 
we expect as the weak economy continues  additional retailers will announce store closings and or bankruptcies that could negatively impact our shopping centers 
while retail sales remain depressed  we could experience further reductions in rent and occupancy related to tenants exercising their co tenancy clauses as discussed previously 
however  we are not currently aware of the pending bankruptcy or announced store closings of any tenants in our shopping centers beyond those described above that would individually cause a material reduction in our revenues  and no tenant represents more than of our annual base rent on a pro rata basis 
liquidity and capital resources our parent company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our operating partnership  which are discussed further below under contractual obligations 
the parent company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the operating partnership in exchange for additional partnership units 
any new debt is issued by our operating partnership or by our co investment partnerships 
accordingly  the discussion below regarding liquidity and capital resources is presented on a consolidated basis for the company 
the following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating  investing  and financing activities of the company for the years ended december    and in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during  we completed the following capital sourcing transactions on april   we completed a public offering of million common shares at per share resulting in proceeds of million  net of issuance costs  a portion of which was used to fully repay the company s million balance on its line of credit and fund construction costs 
on july   we closed on mortgage loans of million secured by eight wholly owned properties the allianz loan 
additionally  during  our co investment partnerships closed on million of mortgage loans for which our pro rata share based upon our partnership ownership interests was million 
on october  we finalized the formation of a new co investment partnership with the united services automobile association the usaa partnership in which we have a ownership interest 
during  we sold eight operating properties to the usaa partnership for million  providing us with net proceeds of million 
on december   we completed a public offering of  common shares at per share which will result in net proceeds of  net of issuance costs at a future settlement date expected to occur no later than in connection with this offering  we entered into forward sale agreements with affiliates of jp morgan securities inc and wells fargo securities  llc  as forward purchasers 
we intend to use the proceeds  once settled  to repay debt of the operating partnership 
this offering also included an over allotment option of  shares which closed simultaneously with the offering providing us with additional net proceeds of million 
on december  our cash balance was million 
we operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities in combination with proceeds generated from gains realized on sales of development properties and land will provide the necessary funds to pay our 
table of contents scheduled mortgage loan principal payments  capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers  and distributions to our share and unit holders 
net cash provided by operating activities plus gains from the sale of development properties and land of million  million and million totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the years ended december    and  we incurred capital expenditures to maintain our shopping centers of million  million  and million  we paid scheduled principal payments of million  million  and million  and we paid distributions of million  million  and million  respectively 
during  these expenditures and distributions exceeded our cash provided by operating activities and gains by million due to a decline in our revenues and gains  which is discussed further below under results from operations 
our board of directors anticipated these declines  and accordingly  reduced our quarterly dividend to per share and unit beginning in may from the previous paid in march our dividend distribution policy is set by our board of directors who continuously review our financial results and make decisions they believe prudent about distribution rates 
we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that at a minimum meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
commitments available to us under our operating partnership s unsecured line of credit the line and revolving credit facility total million 
as of february   we had no balance outstanding on the line or the revolving credit facility 
the line is available to us through january  at which time we have the option to extend million of the commitment to january based upon our on going discussions with our line banks  we believe we will be able to successfully negotiate and extend the line at a commitment level sufficient to meet our working capital and investment needs when it matures 
we currently estimate that we will require approximately million through primarily to repay million of maturing debt  complete in process developments  and to fund our pro rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co investment partnerships for repayment of debt 
included in these capital requirements are million of unsecured public debt as further described below under notes payable  which we intend to repay at maturity from the proceeds of new unsecured issues 
to the extent that issuing unsecured debt is cost prohibitive or unavailable  we believe that we have sufficient unsecured assets available for secured mortgage financing whose proceeds could be used to repay the unsecured debt at maturity 
when necessary  the line is available to fund our capital needs 
also  as mentioned previously  we will receive million of net proceeds once we settle the million common share forward equity offering in the future 
at december  we had properties under construction or undergoing major renovations on a combined basis  which when completed  will represent a net investment of million after projected sales of adjacent land and out parcels 
this compares to properties that were under construction at december  representing an investment of million upon completion 
we estimate that we will earn an average return on investment from our current development projects of when completed and fully leased 
average returns have declined over previous years primarily as a result of longer lease up periods and reduced market rental rates 
costs necessary to complete the current development projects  net of reimbursements and projected land sales  are estimated to be approximately million 
our joint ventures have billion of secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing through we believe that in order to refinance the maturing joint venture loans  we  along with our joint venture partners  will be required to contribute our pro rata share of the capital necessary to reduce the amount of borrowings to acceptable loan to value levels required for this type of financing 
we currently estimate that we will contribute approximately million to our joint ventures through for our pro rata share of the repayment of maturing debt  net of the proceeds from new debt issues  and we estimate our joint venture partners will contribute million for their share 
a more detailed loan maturity schedule is included below under notes payable 
we believe that our joint venture partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or 
table of contents access thereto to fund future capital requirements 
we communicate with our co investment partners regularly regarding the operating and capital budgets of our co investment partnerships  and believe that we will successfully complete the refinancing of our joint venture debt as it matures 
in the event that a co investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co investment partnership  we would have the right  but not the obligation  to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call at an interest rate at the lesser of prime plus a pre defined spread or the maximum rate allowed by law 
a decision to loan to a defaulting joint venture partner  which would be secured by the defaulting partner s partnership interest  would be based on the fair value of the co investment partnership assets  our joint venture partner s financial health and would be subject to an evaluation of our own capital commitments and sources to fund those commitments 
alternatively  should we determine that our joint venture partners will not have sufficient capital to meet future capital needs  we could trigger liquidation of the partnership 
for the co investment partnerships that have distribution in kind dik provisions  and own multiple properties  a liquidation of the co investment partnership could be completed by either a dik of the properties to each joint venture partner in proportion to its partnership interest  open market sale  or a combination of both methods 
our co investment partnership properties have been financed with non recourse loans that represent of the total debt of the co investment partnerships at december  including lines of credit 
we and our partners have no guarantees related to these loans 
in those co investment partnerships which have dik provisions  if we trigger liquidation by distribution in kind  each partner would receive title to properties selected in a rotation process for distribution and would assume any related loans secured by the properties distributed 
the loan agreements generally provide for assumption by either joint venture partner after obtaining any required lender consent 
we would only be responsible for those loans we assume through the dik  and only to the extent of the value of the property we receive since after assumption through the dik the loans would remain non recourse 
we also have a investment interest in a single asset joint venture with an million loan which contains guarantees from each partner limited however to their respective interest 
our preferred stock and preferred units  though callable by us  are not redeemable in cash at the option of the holders 
although common or preferred equity raised in the public markets by the parent company is an option to fund future capital needs  access to these markets could be limited at times 
during  we successfully completed million of common stock offerings 
when conditions for the issuance of equity are acceptable  we will evaluate issuing equity to fund new acquisition opportunities  fund new developments  or repay maturing debt 
at december   the parent company and the operating partnership each had existing shelf registration statements available for the issuance of new equity or debt securities  respectively 
investments in real estate partnerships we account for certain investments in real estate partnerships using the equity method 
we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and do not require consolidation under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  and therefore are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting 
major decisions  including property acquisitions not meeting pre established investment criteria  dispositions  financings  annual budgets and dissolution of the joint ventures are subject to the approval of all partners 
recognition of gains from sales to co investment partnerships is recorded on only that portion of the sales not attributable to our ownership interest unless there are certain provisions in the partnership agreement which allow the company a unilateral right to initiate a dik upon liquidation  as described further below under our critical accounting policies and note b summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements each included herein 
the presence of such dik provisions requires that we apply a more restrictive method of gain recognition restricted gain method on sales of properties to these co investment partnerships 
this method considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized  and ensures maximum gain deferral upon sale to a co investment partnership containing these unilateral dik rights dik jv 

table of contents the operations and gains related to properties sold to our investments in real estate partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because we continue to provide to these shopping centers property management services under market rate agreements with our co investment partnerships 
for those properties acquired by the joint venture from unrelated parties  we are required to contribute our pro rata share based on our ownership interest of the purchase price to the co investment partnerships 
at december   we had investments in real estate partnerships of million

our 
table of contents investment in mcwr ii totals million and represents of our total assets at december  on july   we announced that mcw had agreed to sell of its partnership interest in mcwr ii to gri in two closings 
the initial closing was completed on july   with mcw selling of its interest to gri 
as part of the closing  we acquired macquarie regency management  llc s us manager ownership of mcwr ii 
us manager was owned by us and an affiliate of macquarie bank limited 
the transaction increased our ownership in mcwr ii to from 
at the initial closing we received a disposition fee of million from mcw equal to of the gross sales price paid by gri

one additional property was sold to the usaa partnership on november  the eight properties were sold for million and net proceeds from the sale to the company were million 
the partnership agreement has a unilateral right to elect to dissolve the partnership and receive a dik upon liquidation  therefore  we applied the restricted gain method to determine the amount of gain recognized 
we recognized gain of million and deferred gain of million on these partial sales to the usaa partnership

at december   the term loan had a variable interest rate of or libor plus basis points 
on september  standard and poor s rating services lowered our corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating to bbb from bbb primarily related to the reduction in our coverage ratio in as a result of this downgrade  the interest rate on the line increased to libor plus basis points and the interest rate on the revolving portion of the term facility increased to libor plus basis points  respectively  effective october  including both the line commitment and the term facility collectively  unsecured credit facilities  we currently have million of total capacity and the interest rate spread paid is dependent upon our maintaining specific investment grade ratings 
we are also required to comply with certain financial covenants as defined in the credit agreement such as minimum net worth  ratio of total liabilities to gross asset value gav and ratio of recourse secured indebtedness to gav  ratio of ebitda to fixed charges  and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing 
as of december   management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants for our unsecured credit facilities 
our unsecured credit facilities are used to finance the acquisition and development of real estate  and for general working capital purposes 
notes payable consist of secured mortgage loans and unsecured public debt 
mortgage loans may be prepaid  but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums 
mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest or interest only  and mature over various terms through  whereas  interest on unsecured public debt is payable semi annually and matures over various terms through we intend to repay mortgage loans at maturity with proceeds from similar new issues or from the line

currently  our variable rate debt represents less than of our total debt 
the carrying value of our variable rate notes payable and the unsecured credit facilities are based upon a spread above libor which is lower than the spreads available in the current credit market  causing the fair value of such variable rate debt to be below its carrying value 
the fair value of fixed rate loans are estimated using cash flows discounted at current market rates available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities 
fixed rate loans assumed in connection with real estate acquisitions are recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at fair value at the time of acquisition excluding those loans assumed in dik liquidations which are assumed at carrying value 
based on the estimates used  the fair value of notes payable and the unsecured credit facilities is approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
as of december   scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the unsecured credit facilities were as follows in thousands scheduled principal payments by year scheduled principal payments mortgage loan maturities unsecured public debt total beyond years unamortized debt discounts  net total at december   our investments in real estate partnerships had notes payable of billion maturing through  of which had weighted average fixed interest rates of

our pro rata share of these loans was million 
we and our partners have no guarantees related to these loans except for an million loan related to our ownership interest in one single asset real estate partnership where we are only responsible for our pro rata share of the loan

in order to manage the volatility related to interest rate risk  we originate new debt with fixed interest rates  or we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
on march   we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps totaling million with fixed rates of    and 
on april   we paid million to partially settle million of the million interest rate swaps in place to hedge the million mortgage loan issued on july  described previously 
for million of the remaining swaps  we continue to expect to issue new secured or unsecured debt for a term of to years prior to july  for million of the remaining swaps  we continue to expect to issue new debt for a term of to years during the period between march  and march  the fair value of these swaps was a liability of million at december  if we were to no longer expect to issue new debt within the terms and periods described above  we would be required to immediately charge the change in the fair value of these swaps to net income as well as all future changes in value 
during december  following the successful completion of our million share common stock offering discussed previously  we revised our assumptions of future debt issues by delaying a portion of our expected issuances into although we still expect to issue new debt within the time frames originally contemplated  the change in our issuance assumptions caused a portion of our swaps to become ineffective due to an over hedged position and resulted in us recognizing a loss on hedge ineffectiveness of million 
the valuation of these derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves  and implied volatilities 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads  to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties 
equity and capital we have issued common and preferred stock from the parent company and common and preferred units from the operating partnership to fund our capital commitments and to maintain a conservative capital structure as described below 
equity of the parent company the series   and preferred shares are perpetual  are not convertible into common stock of the parent company  and are redeemable at par upon our election beginning five years after the issuance date 
none of the terms of the preferred stock contain any unconditional obligations that would require us to redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose and we do not currently anticipate redeeming any preferred stock

critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon  but not limited to  our judgments about historical results  current economic activity  and industry accounting standards 
they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness  however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable accounts receivable represent revenues recognized in our financial statements  and include base rent  percentage rent  and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes 
we analyze tenant receivables  historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when 
table of contents evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our reported net income loss is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable 
recognition of gains from the sales of real estate profits from sales of real estate are not recognized under the full accrual method by us unless a sale is consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  a receivable  if applicable  is not subject to future subordination  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property 
we sell shopping center properties to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair value of the percentage interest acquired by our partners 
we have accounted for those sales as partial sales and recognized gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest sold  and in the case of certain joint venture partnerships  we apply a more restrictive method of recognizing gains  as discussed further below 
the gains and operations associated with properties sold to these joint venture partnerships are not classified as discontinued operations because we continue to partially own and manage these shopping centers 
certain dik jvs give either partner the unilateral right to elect to dissolve the joint venture partnership and  upon such an election  receive a distribution in kind of the assets of the joint venture partnership equal to its respective ownership interests 
the liquidation provisions require that all of the properties owned by the joint venture partnership be appraised to determine their respective and collective fair values 
as a general rule  if we initiate the liquidation process  our partner has the right to choose the first property that it will receive in liquidation and we have the right to choose the next property that we will receive in liquidation  if our partner initiates the liquidation process  the order of the selection process is reversed 
the process then continues with alternating selection of properties by each partner until the balance of each partner s capital account on a fair value basis has been distributed 
after the final selection  to the extent that the fair value of properties in the dik jv is not distributable in a manner that equals the balance of each partner s capital account  a cash payment would be made to the other partner by the partner receiving a fair value in excess of its capital account 
the partners may also elect to liquidate some or all of the properties through sales rather than through the dik process 
we have concluded that these dik dissolution provisions constitute in substance call put options  and represent a form of continuing involvement with respect to property that we sold to these joint venture partnerships  limiting our recognition of gain related to the partial sale 
this more restrictive method of gain recognition  the restricted gain method  considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized  and ensures  as discussed below  maximum gain deferral upon sale to a dik jv 
we have applied the restricted gain method to partial sales of property to joint venture partnerships that contain such unilateral dik provisions 
profit shall be recognized by a method determined by the nature and extent of the seller s continuing involvement and the profit recognized shall be reduced by the maximum exposure to loss 
we have concluded that the restricted gain method accomplishes this objective 
under the restricted gain method  for purposes of gain deferral  we consider the aggregate pool of properties sold into the dik jv as well as the aggregate pool of properties which will be distributed in the dik process 
as a result  upon the sale of properties to a dik jv  we perform a hypothetical dik liquidation analysis assuming that we would choose only those properties that we have sold to the dik jv in an amount equal to our capital account 
for purposes of calculating the gain to be deferred  we assume that the company will select properties in a dik liquidation that would otherwise have generated the highest gain to us when originally sold to the dik jv and include for such determination the fair value in properties that could be received in excess of the company s capital account 
the deferred gain to be recorded upon a sale of a property to a dik jv is calculated whenever a property is sold to the dik jv by us 
during the periods when there are no property sales to a dik jv  the deferred gain is not recalculated 
because the contingency associated with the possibility of receiving a particular property back 
table of contents upon liquidation  which forms the basis of the restricted gain method  is not satisfied at the property level  but at the aggregate level  no gain is recognized on property sold by the dik jv to a third party or received by us upon actual dissolution 
instead  the property received upon actual dissolution is recorded at the carrying value of our investment in the dik jv on the date of dissolution  reduced by the deferred gain 
capitalization of costs we capitalize the acquisition of land  the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in summary  a project changes from non operating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy 
at that time  costs are no longer capitalized 
other development costs include pre development costs essential to the development of the property  as well as  interest  real estate taxes  and direct employee costs incurred during the development period 
pre development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits  legal  engineering  and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
at december  and  we capitalized pre development costs of approximately  and million  respectively  of which approximately  and million  respectively  were refundable contract deposits 
if we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence is no longer probable  we immediately expense all related capitalized pre development costs not considered recoverable 
during the years ended december    and  we expensed pre development costs of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended 
we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond months after substantial completion of the building shell 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized interest of million  million  and million  respectively  on our development projects 
we have a staff of employees the investment group who support our development program 
all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized million  million  and million  respectively  of direct costs incurred by the investment group 
the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring 
as a result of the current economic downturn  development activity slowed significantly during resulting in a reduction in capitalized costs and a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses as non capitalized investment group costs were charged to earnings 
during we significantly reduced our investment group staff to adjust to a lower level of development activity expected in the future  as compared to periods prior to if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur additional increases in general and administrative expenses which would further reduce net income 
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties  we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building and improvements  and identify intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt 
based on these estimates  we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 
valuation of real estate investments our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable  we write down the asset to fair value 
for properties to be held and used for long term investment  we estimate undiscounted future cash flows over the expected investment term 
table of contents including the estimated future value of the asset upon sale at the end of the investment period 
future value is generally determined by applying a market based capitalization rate to the estimated future net operating income in the final year of the expected investment term 
if after applying this method a property is determined to be impaired  we determine the provision for impairment based upon current market resale values through comparable sales information and other market data if available  or by applying a market capitalization rate to current estimated net operating income 
for properties held for sale  we estimate current market resale values through appraisal less expected costs to sell 
a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting  which is other than a temporary decline  must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs 
in the case of our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships  we calculate the present value of our investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment 
methods of determining fair value can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate  our estimated holding period of the property  tenant credit quality  and demand for new retail stores 
if as a result of a change in our strategy for a specific property which we own directly or through our co investment partnerships  a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale  or if its estimated holding period changes  such change could cause us to determine that the property is impaired and a provision for impairment in relation to that property would be recorded by us either directly or through a reduction of our equity in income of real estate partnerships 
discontinued operations the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet  or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued  requires management to make certain significant judgments 
we classify an operating property or a property in development as held for sale when we determine that the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition  the property is being actively marketed for sale  and management believes it is probable that a sale will be consummated within one year 
given the nature of real estate sales contracts  it is not unusual for such contracts to allow a contractual buyer a due diligence period to evaluate the property with the right to cancel the contract without any financial loss 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  or may not close at all 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth above 
in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued operations  prior to the sale  we evaluate the extent of involvement and significance of cash flows the sale will have with a property after the sale 
any property sold in which we have significant continuing involvement or cash flows most often sales to co investment partnerships in which we continue to manage the property is not considered to be discontinued 
in addition  any property which we sell to an unrelated third party  but which we retain a property management function  is not considered discontinued 
therefore  only properties sold  or to be sold  to unrelated third parties  where we will have no significant continuing involvement or significant cash flows are classified as discontinued and its operations  including any mortgage interest and gain on sale  are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations are clearly distinguished 
prior periods are also reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
when we sell operating properties to our joint ventures or to third parties  and will have continuing involvement  the operations and gains on sales are included in income from continuing operations 
if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as held and used and is measured individually at the lower of its i carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
any required adjustment to the carrying amount of the property reclassified as held and used is included in income from continuing operations in the period of the subsequent decision not to sell 
if a property is reclassified as held and used  the results of operations of the property previously reported in discontinued operations are reclassified and included in income from continuing operations for all periods presented 
investments in real estate partnerships in addition to owning real estate directly  we invest in 
table of contents real estate through our co investment partnerships 
as asset and property manager  we conduct the business of the unconsolidated properties held in the co investment partnerships in the same way that we conduct the business of the consolidated properties that are wholly owned  therefore  the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the real estate partnerships 
we account for all investments in which we do not have a controlling financial ownership interest using the equity method 
we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities and do not require consolidation  and therefore  are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting 
decisions  including property acquisitions and dispositions  financings  certain leasing arrangements  annual budgets and dissolution of the joint ventures are subject to the approval of all partners  or in the case of the fund  its advisory committee 
income tax status the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that the parent company will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit  as defined under the internal revenue code the code 
the parent company is required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that it continues to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  the parent company is allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of its distributions to stockholders 
we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status 
determining our taxable income  calculating distributions  and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the code 
because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations  our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities  however  we reassess such positions at each reporting period 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu provides amendments to subtopic and requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of levels and and activity in level fair value measurements 
asu also clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities and for the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
asu is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted this asu on december  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu 
asu was issued to reflect the amendments from statement amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r as a revision to fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
asu changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on  among other things  the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance 
asu was effective january  and early application is not permitted 
we have evaluated the adoption of this asu and it will not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position  as we do not currently have any variable interests that we believe would require consolidation 
results from operations vs 
comparison of the years ended december  to at december   on a combined basis  we were operating or developing shopping centers  as compared to shopping centers at december  the decline in properties is related to the liquidation of the assets of mcwr i where the properties were distributed through a dik to 
table of contents mcw and regency  and in which we received six properties 
we identify our shopping centers as either properties in development or operating properties 
properties in development are defined as properties that are in the construction or lease up process and have not reached their initial full occupancy 
a development property becomes an operating property at the earlier to occur of attaining leased and rent paying or four years from the start of site work  regardless of the leased 
at december   on a combined basis  we had development properties  as compared to properties at december  our revenues decreased by million or to million in  as summarized in the following table in thousands change minimum rent percentage rent recoveries from tenants and other income management  transaction  and other fees total revenues our decline in revenues was related to a one time transaction fee earned and recognized in  which is more fully described in the table and discussion below 
the increase in minimum rent relates primarily to new properties distributed to us as part of the mcwr i dik liquidation and new rent generated by the development properties 
in addition to collecting minimum rent from our tenants  we also collect percentage rent from certain tenants based on their sales volumes  which is lower than due to previous percentage rent tenants renewing their leases upon expiration and converting their percentage rent to higher base rent 
recoveries from tenants represent reimbursements from tenants for their pro rata share of the operating  maintenance  and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers 
recoveries from tenants were higher in due to increases in our operating expenses  but our recoveries as a percentage of the expenses related only to our operating properties declined to from in as a result of a decline in our occupancy percentage and an increase in non recoverable expenses 
our operating properties  excluding those in development  on a pro rata basis were leased at december  as compared to at the end of our renewal rate of expiring leases was for the year ended  but rental rates on leases executed during declined as compared to the previous rental rates earned on the same gla under previous leases 
during  our renewal rate was and rental rates on leases executed grew by 
our lease renewal rates and rental growth rates in were severely impacted by the recent recession

diluted earnings per unit was in as compared to in environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry  the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers  and underground petroleum storage tanks 
we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations 
generally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to non chlorinated solvent systems 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance  where possible  on specific properties with known contamination  in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites 
we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 
we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately million  all of which has been reserved 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity  or operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation deflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  more recent data suggests inflation will eventually become a greater concern as the economy begins to recover from the recent recession 
substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
however  during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness  minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines 
occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 
our line commitment has a variable interest rate that is based upon libor plus a spread of basis points and our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate based upon libor plus a spread of basis points 
libor rates charged on our unsecured credit facilities change monthly 
the spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings 
if our credit ratings are downgraded  the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase  resulting in higher interest costs 
we are also exposed to higher interest rates when we refinance our existing long term fixed rate debt 
the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we have million of fixed rate debt maturing in and that has a weighted average fixed interest rate of  which includes million of unsecured long term debt 
during we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps the swaps totaling million with fixed rates of    and 
we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to lock in the underlying treasury rates on million of the financing expected to occur in and as a result of a decline in year treasury interest rates since the inception of the swaps  the fair value of the swaps as of december  is reflected as a liability of million in accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
it remains highly probable that the forecasted transactions will occur as projected at the inception of the swaps and therefore  the change in fair value of the swaps is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if we were to no longer expect to issue debt as originally forecasted  we would be required to immediately expense the change in fair value of the swaps to net income including all future changes until settled 
during the year ended december   we had million of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings attributable to our revised assumptions of future debt issues 
to the extent that future year treasury rates at the future settlement dates are higher than current rates  this liability will decline 
if a liability exists at the dates the swaps are settled  the liability will be amortized over the term of the respective debt issuances as additional interest expense in addition to the stated interest rates on the new debt 
on april   we paid million to settle and partially settle million of our million of interest rate swaps in place to hedge forecasted debt 
on july   we closed on mortgage loans of million secured by eight properties with an interest rate of and a year term 
for million of the remaining swaps  we continue to expect to issue new secured or unsecured debt for a term of to years prior to july  for million of the remaining swaps  we continue to expect to issue new debt for a term of to years during the period between march  and march  we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments 
based upon the current capital markets  our current credit ratings  and the number of high quality  unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings  we expect that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations 
an increase of in the interest rate of new debt issued  above that of maturing debt  would result in additional annual interest expense of million subject to the impact of the annual amortization that would be incurred as a result of settling the swaps 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december   by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table  those rates represent rates that existed at december  and are subject to change on a monthly basis 

table of contents the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
since firm commitments are not presented  the table has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and actual interest rates 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate forall fixed rate debt a variable rate libor debt average interest rate forall variable rate debt a a average interest rates at the end of each year presented 
the fair value of total debt in the table above is billion versus the face value of billion  which suggests that as new debt is issued in the future to repay maturing debt  the cost of new debt issuances will be higher than the current cost of existing debt
