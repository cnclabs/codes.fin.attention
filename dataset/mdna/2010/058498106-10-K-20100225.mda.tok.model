item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this report  which include additional information about our accounting policies  practices and the transactions underlying our financial results 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business 
we apply our best judgment  our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience  as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances  such as current economic conditions  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results may differ from these estimates 
ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball or the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis 
overview business overview ball corporation is one of the world s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage  food and household products industries 
our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world 
we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 
we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage  food and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships 
this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts 
while we have a diversified customer base  we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america  europe  the people s republic of china prc and argentina  as do our equity joint ventures in brazil  the us and the prc 
we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers 
because of our customer and supplier concentration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss  insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier  although our contracts and long term relationships generally mitigate the risk of customer loss 
we are also subject to exposure from inflation and the rising costs of raw materials  as well as other inputs into our direct costs 
we reduce our risk to these exposures either by fixing our material costs through derivative contracts or by including provisions in our sales contracts to recover the increases from our customers 
industry trends and corporate strategy in the rigid packaging industry  sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs  increasing prices  developing new products and expanding volumes 
over the past two years  we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand 
we have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our operations 
as part of our packaging strategy  we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer 
these innovations include new shapes  sizes  opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging 
this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage  food and household products customers 
while the north american beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature  the european  prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term 
while we are able to capitalize on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our european can manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion  we have put on hold various projects  including the completion of the construction of a plant in poland  due to the current world wide economic environment 
however  we continue to believe that central and eastern europe will be an area of growth once the economy recovers 
our brazilian joint venture has completed the construction of a metal beverage container plant near rio de janeiro and has added further can capacity in the existing jacarei can plant 
these brazilian expansion efforts are owned by ball s unconsolidated percent owned joint venture  latapack ball embalagens  ltda  and the expansion was funded by cash flows from operations and incurrence of debt by the joint venture 
page of ball s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments  as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a of this report 
the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 
it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities  or changes in agency budgets  could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance 
we expect that the delay of certain program awards  as well as federal budget considerations  will have an unfavorable impact on this segment in  and we are continuing to take steps to adjust our resources accordingly 
we recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost  percentage of completion method of accounting 
our present contract mix consists of approximately two thirds cost type contracts  which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component  and approximately percent fixed price contracts 
the remainder represents time and material contracts  which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates 
failure to be awarded certain key contracts could further adversely affect segment performance in compared to throughout the period of contract performance  we regularly reevaluate and  if necessary  revise our estimates of ball aerospace and technologies corp 
s total contract revenue  total contract cost and progress toward completion 
because of contract payment schedules  limitations on funding and other contract terms  our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 
management performance measures management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as earnings before interest and taxes ebit  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  diluted earnings per share  cash flow from operating activities  free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment  and economic value added net operating earnings after tax  as defined by the company  less a capital charge on net operating assets employed 
these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on dispositions 
nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates  quality control figures  environmental  health and safety statistics  production and sales volumes  asset utilization rates  and measures of sustainability 
additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization  award and incentive fees realized  proposal win rates and backlog including awarded  contracted and funded backlog 
we recognize that attracting  developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of ball and  because of that  we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio 
for most management employees  a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive  dependent upon economic value added operating performance 
for more senior positions  more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various long term and stock compensation plans 
through our employee stock purchase plan and k plan  which matches employee contributions with ball common stock  employees  regardless of organizational level  have opportunities to own ball stock 
page of results of operations consolidated sales and earnings the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines  after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics metal beverage packaging  americas and asia  metal beverage packaging  europe  metal food and household products packaging  americas  plastic packaging  americas  and aerospace and technologies 
we also have investments in companies in the us  the prc and brazil  which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and  accordingly  those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 
metal beverage packaging  americas and asia in millions net sales legal settlement a total net sales segment earnings legal settlement a business consolidation costs a total segment earnings a further details of these items are included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
the metal beverage packaging  americas and asia  segment consists of operations located in the us  canada  puerto rico through fiscal year and the prc  which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as non beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the prc 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in and percent in  including the impact of the million legal settlement discussed below 
net sales were percent lower in than in  primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices partially offset by a percent increase in sales volumes 
the higher sales volumes in were the result of incremental volumes from the four plants purchased from anheuser busch inbev nv sa ab inbev on october discussed further below  partially offset by lower sales volumes and plant closures in the existing business 
excluding the effect of the legal settlement  sales were percent lower in than in  primarily as a result of decreases in north american sales volumes of approximately percent 
the decrease was due primarily to lower unit volume sales to carbonated soft drink customers  consistent with the industry  and lost beer sales volumes on the discontinuance of a contract that did not provide sufficient profitability 
this decrease was partially offset by sales volume increases in the prc of percent during based on publicly available information  we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers in were approximately percent of total us and canadian shipments and percent of total prc shipments 
we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business  which includes cans of different shapes  diameters and fill volumes  and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions 
in a customer asserted various claims against the company  primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by a subsidiary  and on october   the dispute was settled in mediation 
the customer received million million after tax to settle the dispute  and ball retained all of the customer s beverage can and end supply through ball made a one time payment of million million after tax in january with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract 
excluding the business consolidation charges  segment earnings in were higher than in due to million of earnings contribution from the four acquired plants  approximately million of savings associated with the plant closures discussed below and million of margin growth in asia 
partially offsetting these favorable impacts were lower carbonated soft drink and beer can sales volumes excluding the newly acquired plants and million related to higher cost inventories in the first half of excluding the business consolidation charge in and the legal settlement in  earnings in were lower than in by percent  primarily due to raw material inventory gains of million realized in  which did not recur in earnings in were also negatively impacted by lower north american sales volumes  which were partially offset by the higher sales volumes in the prc 
page of on october   the company acquired three of anheuser busch inbev nv sa s ab inbev metal beverage can manufacturing plants and one of its beverage can end manufacturing plants  all of which are located in the us  for million in cash 
the acquired plants produce approximately billion aluminum beverage containers and billion beverage can ends annually  more than two thirds of which are produced for leading soft drink companies and the rest for ab inbev 
the plants operations were included in ball s results beginning october   which amounted to million of net sales and million of segment earnings from that date through december  the facilities acquired employ approximately people 
the acquired plants will enhance the segment s ability to better serve its customers 
on november   the company announced its agreement to acquire guangdong jianlibao group co  ltd s jianlibao percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in sanshui  prc 
ball has owned percent of the joint venture plant since ball will acquire the plant and related net assets for approximately million in cash and assumed debt and will also enter into a long term supply agreement with jianlibao 
the transaction is expected to close in  subject to customary regulatory approvals 
we are actively pursuing improved profitability through better asset utilization and cost optimization throughout the segment 
we are also committed to improving margins on this portion of our business through better commercial terms 
we continue to focus efforts on the custom beverage can business  specifically on cans of different shapes  diameters and fill volumes and by developing cans with added functional attributes such as resealability and through product line extensions 
as part of our efforts to improve profitability  we undertook various actions in and including the reduction of headcount in our metal beverage packaging business and the closures of our guayama  puerto rico  kansas city  missouri  and kent  washington  metal beverage container plants 
metal beverage packaging  europe in millions net sales segment earnings the metal beverage packaging  europe  segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in europe 
ball packaging europe  which represents an estimated percent of total european metal beverage container shipments in excluding russia  has manufacturing plants located in germany  the united kingdom  france  the netherlands  poland and serbia  and is the second largest metal beverage container business in europe 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in and percent in 
segment sales in as compared to were percent lower due to the translation impact of the euro to the us dollar  partially offset by better commercial terms 
sales volumes in were essentially flat compared to those in the prior year 
segment sales in were percent higher than in  due largely to higher sales volumes of approximately percent  consistent with overall market growth  higher sales prices and foreign currency gains of percent on the strength of the euro 
these positive impacts were offset by certain small unfavorable cost changes  including product mix changes towards smaller containers 
while sales volumes were consistent with the prior year  the adverse effects of foreign currency translation  both within europe and on the conversion of the euro to the us dollar  reduced segment earnings by million 
also contributing to lower segment earnings were higher cost inventory carried into and a change in sales mix  partially offset by better commercial terms in some of our contracts 
earnings in were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of approximately million due to the combined impact of the increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives  which exceeded the negative impact from product mix  as well as approximately million related to a stronger euro 
these improvements were partially offset by approximately million of higher other costs including a negative foreign exchange impact from the conversion of the british pound to the euro and million for business interruption recoveries in that were not repeated in for further details see below 
page of in april  a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch  germany  damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment 
in the company recorded million million for insurance proceeds  which were based on replacement cost  and million million in cost of sales for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs 
metal food and household products packaging  americas in millions net sales segment earnings business consolidation costs a total segment earnings a further details of these items are included in note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us  canada and argentina and includes the manufacture and sale of metal food cans  aerosol cans  paint cans  general line cans and decorative specialty cans 
segment sales were percent of consolidated net sales in percent in both and 
segment sales in increased percent over due to higher selling prices driven by higher raw material costs beginning in  which were partially offset by an percent decrease in sales volume caused by the effects of the economic recession and ball s decision to not pursue low margin business 
we estimate our shipments accounted for approximately percent and percent of total annual us and canadian steel food container and steel aerosol container shipments  respectively 
segment sales in increased percent compared to mostly due to higher selling prices offset by an approximate percent decrease in sales volumes primarily as a result of decisions by management to discontinue low margin business  which led to the announced closure of our commerce  california  and tallapoosa  georgia  facilities in excluding the business consolidation activities for each period  earnings in were percent higher than in due primarily to the increased sales prices mentioned above coupled with million of lower cost inventory carried into and million of improvements in manufacturing performance  partially offset by the lower sales volumes and a settlement gain of million in not recurring in the percent higher earnings in compared to were largely related to improved pricing  better manufacturing performance and the million settlement gain  partially offset by the negative impact of percent lower sales volumes in as part of our efforts to improve profitability in this segment and to better align supply with customer demand  we announced plans in october to close aerosol manufacturing plants in tallapoosa  georgia  and commerce  california 
the commerce plant was closed in  and the tallapoosa plant was closed in the first quarter of the cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries 
plastic packaging  americas in millions net sales segment earnings business consolidation costs a gain on disposition a total segment earnings a further details of these items are included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
page of the plastic packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us and canada through most of the third quarter of  which manufacture pet and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging  as well as polypropylene containers for household product applications 
on october   the company announced the sale of its plastic pail assets to bway corporation for approximately million 
the transaction involved the sale of a plastic pail manufacturing plant in newnan  georgia  which ball acquired in as part of its purchase of us can corporation  and associated contracts 
the plant produces injection molded plastic pails and drums for products such as building materials and pool chemicals 
the associated after tax loss was insignificant 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in and percent in 
segment sales in were down percent from sales in despite an increase in conversion sales prices 
an percent decline in bottle sales volumes and a percent reduction in preform sales volumes were the primary reasons for lower sales compared to other factors contributing to lower sales included resin price reductions and the previously mentioned disposition of the plastic pail assets 
segment sales in decreased percent compared to due to a decrease of approximately percent in sales volumes offset by higher raw material cost increases passed through to customers during the volume losses over the three year period included decreases in carbonated soft drink and water bottle sales due  in part  to lower convenience store sales by our customers 
the volume losses were partially offset by higher sales in specialty business markets  which include custom hot fill  alcohol  food and juice drinks 
reduced preform sales also contributed to the sales decreases over the three years due  in part  to the bankruptcy filing of a preform customer in the second quarter of excluding business consolidation charges and the pretax gain on sale of the plastic pail assets  segment earnings in were slightly higher than in  primarily due to higher selling prices and improved operating performance  including benefits from a plant closure in the third quarter of and plant closures in the third quarter of  offset by lower sales volumes 
segment earnings in were lower than in by approximately percent primarily due to the previously mentioned volume losses and a million charge due to a customer bankruptcy filing during the second quarter of in view of the low pet margins  we continue to focus our efforts on price and margin recovery initiatives  as well as pet development efforts in the custom hot fill  beer  wine  flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets 
in the polypropylene plastic container arena  development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets 
we estimate our shipments of pet plastic bottles to be approximately percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments 
in addition  the plastic packaging  americas  segment shipped approximately million polypropylene food and specialty containers during to improve cost performance and gain efficiencies  in the third quarter of we closed pet plastic packaging manufacturing plants in watertown  wisconsin  and baldwinsville  new york 
a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in brampton  ontario  was closed in the third quarter of aerospace and technologies in millions net sales segment earnings gain on disposition a total segment earnings a further details of this item are included in note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
aerospace and technologies segment sales represented percent of consolidated net sales in percent in and percent in 
segment sales in were percent lower than in  driven by the delivery of several large spacecraft 
segment sales in were percent lower as compared to as a result of a combination of large programs nearing completion  program terminations  delays in program awards and government funding constraints 
the reductions were partially offset by new program starts and increased scope on previously awarded contracts 
page of some of the segment s high profile contracts include the james webb space telescope  a successor to the hubble space telescope  the space based space surveillance system  which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris  npoess  the next generation satellite weather monitoring system  and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 
during  we shipped several large instruments spacecraft including kepler january ship  march launch  worldview august ship  october launch  wise august ship  december launch and participated in the latest hubble servicing mission in may 
this segment is also supporting the replacement of the current space shuttle program 
excluding the gain on the sale of an australian subsidiary bsg in  earnings in were down percent compared to  primarily attributable to the winding down of several large programs and overall reduced program activity 
excluding the sale of bsg  segment earnings in were up percent in comparison to earnings improved in as the sales volume decline described above was more than offset by improved margins on contracts due to improvements in program execution  risk retirement on several fixed price programs  as well as a reduction of unreimbursable pension and benefit expenses 
on february   ball completed the sale of its shares in bsg to qinetiq pty ltd for approximately million  including cash sold of million 
the subsidiary provided services to the australian department of defense and related government agencies 
after an adjustment for working capital items  the sale resulted in a pretax gain of million

additional segment information for additional information regarding the company s segments  see the summary of business segment information in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time 
if actual outcomes vary from the estimates  the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses 
additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
undistributed corporate expenses  net included in undistributed corporate expenses for was a million gain million after tax on the sale of a portion of our investment in digitalglobe  a provider of commercial high resolution earth imagery products and services  in conjunction with digitalglobe s initial public offering 
the sale generated proceeds of million in the second quarter of also included in was a charge of million million after tax for transaction costs associated with the ab inbev acquisition  which  in accordance with recent changes to the guidance related to accounting for business combinations  are required to be expensed as incurred 
the transaction costs are included in the business consolidation and other activities line of the consolidated statement of earnings 
undistributed corporate expenses in included million for mark to market losses related to aluminum derivative instruments that were largely recovered in through customer contract arrangements 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increases in sg a expenses in compared to were the result of approximately million of higher employee compensation costs  including incentive compensation costs  and higher stock based compensation costs  including mark to market adjustments for the company s deferred compensation stock plans  million of gains in not recurring in  including a million claim settlement and million of death benefit insurance proceeds  and million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts 
these were offset by net favorable decreased costs of million  including lower receivables securitization fees  legal expenses and research and development costs 
the decreases in sg a expenses in compared to were due to approximately million of lower general and administrative costs as a result of the sale in february of bsg  lower aerospace research and development costs and bid and proposal costs of million  life insurance death benefits of million  the settlement of a claim for million  the favorable net year over year change in foreign currency hedges and exchange impacts of million  and other miscellaneous net cost reductions 
page of interest and taxes consolidated interest expense was million in  million in and million in the lower expense in was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt  partially offset by additional interest associated with the issuance of million of new senior notes in august the reduced expense in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt  as us and european central banks cut interest rates amid the global financial crisis 
based on current estimates  the effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately percent 
ball s consolidated effective income tax rate for was percent compared to percent in and percent in the lower tax rate in as compared to was primarily due to a million net increase in tax benefits as a result of a foreign tax settlement  legislative changes and a release of a valuation allowance for a net operating loss carryforward  a million tax benefit from the sale of shares in a stock investment and other assets due to a higher tax basis and a favorable change of million in the provision for uncertain tax positions due to tax settlements in several foreign jurisdictions 
these benefits were offset somewhat by an increase due to the change in our earnings mix to higher taxed jurisdictions  lower research and development tax credits and a decrease in the benefit of lower tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions coupled with increased withholding taxes 
the lower tax rate in as compared to was primarily the result of earnings mix higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and net tax benefit adjustments of million recorded in additionally  the inability to fully use canadian net operating losses on plant closures in contributed to a higher effective tax rate 
the rate was partially reduced by a million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of for an enacted tax law change in the united kingdom  which was offset by the impact of nondeductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain company owned life insurance plans 
the million net reduction in the tax provision was primarily a result of enacted income tax rate reductions in germany and the united kingdom and a tax loss related to the company s canadian operations  which were offset by an increase in the tax provision for uncertain tax positions in to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded with the internal revenue service irs related to a company owned life insurance plan discussed below 
during the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the irs on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a company owned life insurance plan 
an additional accrual of million was made in the third quarter of to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of million  including interest  for the years through this settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans  which has not had a significant impact on earnings per share  cash flow or liquidity

earnings were million in  million in and million in critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements for information regarding the company s critical and significant accounting policies  as well as recent accounting pronouncements  see note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term and committed revolver borrowings  when necessary  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements  scheduled principal and interest payments on debt  dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures 
we had in excess of million of available funds under committed multi currency revolving credit facilities at december  page of cash flows provided by operations were million in compared to million in and million in lower operating cash flows in compared to were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year 
the reduction in as compared to was primarily due to the payment of approximately million in january of a legal settlement to a customer 
this reduction was partially offset by the net impact of increases in net earnings and depreciation  lower tax payments  lower pension contributions and a net increase in working capital during the year 
financial instrument collateral in our worldwide beverage can business  we use financial derivative contracts as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a of this report to manage certain future aluminum price volatility for our customers 
as these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales contracts  they have little or no economic impact on our earnings 
our agreements with our financial counterparties require us to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark to market value of the contracts exceeds specified levels 
additionally  ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers on these derivative contracts 
the cash flows of the collateral postings are shown within the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
at december   ball had million of cash posted as collateral  which was offset by cash collateral receipts from customers of million 
at december   ball had million of cash posted as collateral and had received million of cash from customers for a net amount of million 
management performance measures the following financial measurements are on a non us gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
non us gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to  or a substitute for  financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap 
a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item of this report 
free cash flow management internally uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company s operating results  to plan stock buyback levels  to evaluate strategic investments and to evaluate the company s ability to incur and service debt 
free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles  and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 
the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment capital spending 
free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company s cash flow statements  however  it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 
in we adjusted free cash flow to reflect our decision to contribute an additional million million after tax to our pension plans and to include the property insurance proceeds used to fund the replacement of the fire damaged assets in our hassloch  germany  plant 
based on the above definition  our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows in millions cash flows from operating activities capital spending proceeds for replacement of fire damaged assets incremental pension funding  net of tax free cash flow there were no reconciling items to cash flows from investing or financing activities as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows within item of this report 
based on information currently available  we estimate cash flows from operating activities for to be approximately million  capital spending to be approximately million and free cash flow to be in the million range 
these estimates do not reflect that  under new accounting guidance effective january   our accounts receivable securitization program will likely be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the related activity shown in our consolidated cash flow statement as a financing activity rather than as an operating activity 
in we intend to allocate our operating cash flow to reducing our debt and growing our cash balances while increasing our stock repurchases and covering our capital spending programs 
page of ebit and ebitda management internally uses adjusted earnings before interest and taxes adjusted ebit and adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda to evaluate the company s performance 
ebit and ebitda are typically derived directly from the company s consolidated statement of earnings  however  they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 
management also uses interest coverage and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratios as metrics to monitor our credit quality 
based on the above definitions  our calculation of adjusted ebit  adjusted ebitda  interest coverage ratio and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio are summarized below in millions  except ratios net earnings add interest expense add tax provision less equity in results of affiliates earnings before interest and taxes ebit add business consolidation and other activities less gain on dispositions add legal settlement adjusted ebit add depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda interest expense total debt at december less cash net debt adjusted ebit interest coverage x x x net debt adjusted ebitda x x x debt facilities and refinancing interest bearing debt at december   increased million to billion from billion at december  the relatively small debt increase from was achieved despite our issuance of million of new senior notes on august  at december   million was available under our multi currency revolving credit facilities 
these committed credit facilities are available until october we also had million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year  on which million was outstanding 
given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until october  our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements 
while the recent financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions  the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party 
we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers  customers  lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 
the financial and economic environment has exacerbated liquidity and credit risks with some of our customers and suppliers 
in october  we advanced interest bearing funding of million in support of one of our key suppliers  which advance is secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   the amount advanced was included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet included within item of this report 
page of we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december   and all prior years presented  and have met all debt payment obligations 
the us note agreements  bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends  investments  financial ratios  guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in notes and  respectively  accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
accounts receivable securitization we have a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing  revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball s north american packaging operations up to million 
the agreement qualifies as off balance sheet financing under accounting guidance in effect through december  net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled million at both december  and and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
under new accounting guidance that will be effective as of january   it is likely that the sold accounts receivable will remain on our consolidated balance sheet  resulting in a corresponding increase in debt 
this will create a one time reduction in cash flows from operating activities in and an offsetting one time increase in cash flows from financing activities 
other liquidity items cash payments required for long term debt maturities  rental payments under noncancellable operating leases  purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december   are summarized in the following table payments due by period a in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest payments on long term debt b operating leases purchase obligations c total payments on contractual obligations a amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at the year end exchange rates 
b for variable rate facilities  amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of hedging instruments 
c the company s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum  steel  plastic resin and other direct materials 
also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity  aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items 
in cases where variable prices and or usage are involved  management s best estimates have been used 
depending on the circumstances  early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and  therefore  actual payments could vary significantly 
contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans  not including the unfunded german plans  are expected to be in the range of million in this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance  among other factors 
benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be million  million  million  million and million for the years ending december  through  respectively  and a total of million for the years through payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be approximately million to million in each of the years through and a total of million for the years through for the us pension plans in  we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption of percent and to change our discount rate assumption to percent from percent in 
based on these assumptions  us pension expense for is anticipated to increase approximately million compared to expense of million  most of which will be included in cost of sales

page of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management in the ordinary course of business  we employ established risk management policies and procedures  which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign currencies and prices of the company s common stock in respect of common share repurchases  although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful 
although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit  market and interest risk  the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 
the company monitors counterparty credit risk  including that of its lenders  on a regular basis  but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that our risk management policies and procedures will always be effective 
we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis 
market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments  financial instruments and commodity positions 
to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure  we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices or rates 
the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 
commodity price risk we manage our north american commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases 
the terms include fixed  floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing 
this matched pricing affects most of our north american metal beverage packaging net sales 
we also  at times  use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 
most of the plastic packaging  americas  sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes 
as a result  we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin 
most metal food and household products packaging  americas  sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur  or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs 
in and in  we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of the steel cost increases 
we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur in in europe and the prc  the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials  as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year 
these contracts include fixed price  floating and or pass through pricing arrangements 
we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to minimize the company s exposure to significant price changes 
considering the effects of derivative instruments  the company s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions  the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures under its contract terms  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the company s steel  aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
additionally  if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by percent  we estimate there could be a million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity  as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost 
a hypothetical percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
a hypothetical percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
page of interest rate risk our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we use a variety of interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
interest rate instruments held by the company at december   included pay fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars 
pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 
collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate 
based on our interest rate exposure at december   assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next months and the effects of derivative instruments  a basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts 
in addition  we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies  and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company s earnings 
our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro  british pound  canadian dollar  polish zloty  chinese renminbi  hong kong dollar  brazilian real  argentine peso and serbian dinar 
we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and  where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement  the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 
we additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the company s european operations into us dollars 
considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december   and the currency exposures  a hypothetical percent reduction us dollar strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
this amount includes the million currency exposure discussed above in the commodity price risk section 
this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by million 
actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
equity price risk the company s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable accounting and  accordingly  is marked to market using the company s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period 
based on current share levels in the program  each change in the company s stock price has an effect of million on pretax earnings 
as a way to partially reduce cash flow and earnings volatility  as well as stock price changes associated with our deferred compensation stock program  from time to time the company sells equity put options on its common stock 
mark to market accounting applies to these equity put options 
approximately million of income was included in earnings to record the variance between the historical fair value and the current market value of outstanding equity put options 
all of the outstanding options expired without value during august page of
