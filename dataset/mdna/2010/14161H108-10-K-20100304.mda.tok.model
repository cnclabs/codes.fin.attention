we maintain a significant amount of cash within our company owned devices  which is subject to potential loss due to theft or other events  including natural disasters 
as of december   there was approximately billion in vault cash held in our domestic and international devices 
although legal and equitable title to such cash is held by the cash providers  any loss of such cash from our atms through theft or other means is typically our responsibility 
we typically require that our cash service providers maintain adequate insurance coverage in the event cash losses occur as a result of misconduct or negligence on the part of such providers 
however  we also maintain our own insurance policies to cover a significant portion of any losses that may occur that may ultimately not be covered by the insurance policies maintained by our service providers 
in the event we incur losses that are covered by our insurance carriers  we will be required to fund a portion of those losses through the payment of any related deductible amounts under those policies 
furthermore  any increase in the frequency and or amounts of such thefts and losses could negatively impact our operating results as a result of higher deductible payments and increased insurance premiums 
additionally  any damage sustained to our merchant customers store locations in connection with any atm related thefts  if extensive and frequent enough in nature  could negatively impact our relationships with such merchants and impair our ability to deploy additional atms in those locations or new locations with those merchants in the future 
finally  impacted merchants may request  and have requested on a limited basis  that we remove atms from store locations that have suffered damage as a result of atm related thefts  thus negatively impacting our financial results 
the atm industry is highly competitive and such competition may increase  which may adversely affect our profit margins 
the atm business is and can be expected to remain highly competitive 
our principal competition comes from independent atm companies in the united states and the united kingdom  and national and regional financial institutions in the united kingdom and mexico 
additionally  we experience competition from national and regional financial institutions in the united states that are not currently bank branding customers or members of our allpoint surcharge free atm network 
our competitors could prevent us from obtaining or maintaining desirable locations for our devices  cause us to reduce the surcharge revenue generated by transactions at our devices  or cause us to pay higher merchant fees  thereby reducing our profits 
in addition to our current competitors  additional competitors may enter the market 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these current and future competitors 
increased competition could result in transaction fee reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

table of contents the election of our merchant customers to not participate in our surcharge free network offerings could impact the networks effectiveness  which would negatively impact our financial results 
financial institutions that are members of allpoint pay a fee in exchange for allowing their cardholders to use selected cardtronics owned and or managed atms on a surcharge free basis 
the success of allpoint is dependent upon the participation by our merchant customers in such networks 
in the event a significant number of our merchants elect not to participate in such networks  the benefits and effectiveness of the networks would be diminished  thus potentially causing some of the participating financial institutions to not renew their agreements with us  and thereby negatively impacting our financial results 
we may be unable to integrate our future acquisitions in an efficient manner and inefficiencies would increase our cost of operations and reduce our profitability 
we have been an active business acquirer both in the united states and internationally  and may continue to be active in the future 
the acquisition and integration of businesses involves a number of risks 
the core risks are in the areas of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence and integration managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company s people  products  technology and other assets so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects 
in addition  acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flows 
any shortfall in anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flows could require us to write down the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with any acquired company  which would adversely affect our reported earnings 
for example  during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment charge to write down the value of the goodwill associated with our investment in bank machine 
since april  we have acquired atm networks and one surcharge free atm network 
prior to our e trade access acquisition in june  we had acquired only the assets of deployed atm networks  rather than businesses and their related infrastructure 
we currently anticipate that our future acquisitions will likely reflect a mix of asset acquisitions and acquisitions of businesses  with each acquisition having its own set of unique characteristics 
to the extent that we elect to acquire an existing company or the operations  technology  and personnel of another atm provider  we may assume some or all of the liabilities associated with the acquired company and face new and added challenges integrating such acquisition into our operations 
any inability on our part to effectively manage our past or future growth could limit our ability to successfully grow the revenue and profitability of our business 
our international operations involve special risks and may not be successful  which would result in a reduction of our gross profits 
as of december   approximately of our devices were located in the united kingdom and mexico 
those devices contributed of our gross profits exclusive of depreciation  accretion  and amortization for the year ended december  we expect to continue to expand in the united kingdom and mexico and potentially into other countries as opportunities arise 
however  our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  including the risk that our future reported operating results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in the functional currencies of our international operations relative to the united states dollar  which represents our consolidated reporting currency  difficulties in complying with the different laws and regulations in each country and jurisdiction in which we operate  including unique labor and reporting laws  
table of contents unexpected changes in laws  regulations  and policies of foreign governments or other regulatory bodies  including changes that could potentially disallow surcharging or that could result in a reduction in the amount of interchange fees received per transaction  unanticipated political and social instability that may be experienced in developing countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including hiring and retaining skilled workers in those countries in which we operate  and potential adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of foreign earnings 
any of these factors could reduce the profitability and revenues derived from our international operations and international expansion 
for example  during the latter half of and during  we incurred reduced revenues from the united states dollar strengthening relative to the british pound and mexican peso 
additionally  the recent political and social instability in mexico resulting from an increase in drug related violence could negatively impact the level of transactions incurred on our existing devices in that market  as well as our ability to successfully grow our business there 
our proposed expansion efforts into new international markets involve unique risks and may not be successful 
we plan to continue expanding our operations internationally with a focus on high growth emerging markets  such as those in central and eastern europe  central and south america  and the asia pacific region 
because the off premise atm industry is relatively undeveloped in these emerging markets  we may not be successful in these expansion efforts 
in particular  many of these markets do not currently employ or support an off premise atm surcharging model  meaning that we would have to rely on interchange fees as our primary source of revenues 
while we have had some success in deploying non surcharging atms in selected markets  such a model requires significant transaction volumes to make it economically feasible to purchase and deploy atms 
furthermore  most of the atms in these markets are owned and operated by financial institutions  thus increasing the risk that cardholders would be unwilling to utilize an off premise atm with an unfamiliar brand 
finally  the regulatory environments in many of these markets are evolving and unpredictable  thus increasing the risk that a particular deployment model chosen at inception may not be economically viable in the future 
in  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
if we experience additional impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets  we will be required to record an additional charge to earnings  which may be significant 
we have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and are required to perform periodic assessments for any possible impairment for accounting purposes 
as of december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million  or of our total assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability and the amortization period of our intangible assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
some of the factors that we consider to be important in assessing whether or not impairment exists include the performance of the related assets relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
these factors  assumptions  and any changes in them could result in an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the event we determine our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets are impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements  which would negatively impact our results of operations and that impact could be material 
for example  during the year ended december   we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
additionally  during each of the years ended december and  we recorded million in net impairment charges associated with intangibles related to our acquired merchant contracts relationships 
other impairment charges in the future may also adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business  remain in compliance with debt covenants  and make payments on our indebtedness 
as of december   we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  which represents of our total capitalization of million 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments  including financial and other restrictive covenants  could result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow in the future to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate  make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  and adverse changes in government regulation  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs  or other purposes 
any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  borrow more money or sell securities  none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 
the terms of our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 
our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes include a number of covenants that  among other items  restrict or limit our ability to sell or transfer property or assets  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock  merge into or consolidate with any third party  create  incur  assume or guarantee additional indebtedness  create certain liens  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  issue or sell preferred stock of restricted subsidiaries  and enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
in addition  we are required by our credit agreement to maintain specified financial ratios and limit the amount of capital expenditures incurred in any given month period 
while we currently have the ability to borrow the full amount available under our credit agreement  as a result of these ratios and limits  we may be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business in the future and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance our future operations or capital needs 
accordingly  these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
a failure to comply with the covenants or financial ratios could result in an event of default 
in the event of a default under our credit agreement  the lenders could exercise a number of remedies  some of which could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the senior subordinated notes 
an acceleration of indebtedness under our credit agreement would also likely result in an event of default under the terms of any other financing arrangement we have outstanding at the time 
if any or all of our debt were to be accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay our indebtedness in full 
if we are unable to repay any amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility when due  the lenders will have the right to proceed against the collateral securing our indebtedness

table of contents we incurred substantial losses in the past and may incur losses again in the future 
although we generated a net profit of million for the year ended december   we incurred net losses in the preceding four years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to achieve profitability in the future 
even if we continue to be profitable  given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate  we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we operate in a changing and unpredictable regulatory environment 
if we are subject to new legislation regarding the operation of our atms  we could be required to make substantial expenditures to comply with that legislation  which may reduce our net income and our profit margins 
with its initial roots in the banking industry  the united states atm industry is regulated by the rules and regulations of the federal electronic funds transfer act  which establishes the rights  liabilities  and responsibilities of participants in eft systems 
the vast majority of states have few  if any  licensing requirements 
however  legislation related to the united states atm industry is periodically proposed at the state and local level 
additionally  the recent increase in surcharge fees by several large financial institutions has prompted certain members of the us congress to call for a reexamination of the interchange and surcharge fees that consumers are charged at an atm 
to date  no such legislation has been enacted that materially adversely affects our business 
in the united kingdom  the atm industry is largely self regulating 
most atms in the united kingdom are part of the link network and must operate under the network rules set forth by link  including complying with rules regarding required signage and screen messages 
additionally  legislation is proposed from time to time at the national level  though nothing to date has been enacted that materially affects our business 
finally  the atm industry in mexico has been historically operated by financial institutions 
banco de mexico supervises and regulates atm operations of both financial institutions and non bank atm deployers 
although  banco de mexico s regulations permit surcharge fees to be charged in atm transactions  it has not issued specific regulations for the provision of atm services 
in addition  in order for a non bank atm deployer to provide atm services in mexico  the deployer must be affiliated with prosa red or e global  which are credit card and debit card proprietary networks that transmit information and settle atm transactions between their participants 
as only financial institutions are allowed to be participants of prosa red or e global  cardtronics mexico entered into a joint venture with bansi  who is a member of prosa red 
as a financial institution  bansi and all entities in which it participates  including cardtronics mexico  are regulated by the ministry of finance and public credit secretaria de hacienda y cr dito p blico and supervised by the banking and securities commission comisi n nacional bancaria y de valores 
additionally  cardtronics mexico is subject to the provisions of the ley del banco de mexico law of banco de mexico  the ley de instituciones de cr dito mexican banking law  and the ley para la transparencia y ordenamiento de los servicios financieros law for the transparency and organization of financial services 
we will continue to monitor all such legislation and attempt  to the extent possible  to prevent the passage of such laws that we believe are needlessly burdensome or unnecessary 
if regulatory legislation is passed in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate  we could be required to make substantial expenditures which would reduce our net income 
the passing of legislation banning or limiting surcharge fees would severely impact our revenues 
despite the nationwide acceptance of surcharge fees at atms in the united states since their introduction in  consumer activists have from time to time attempted to impose local bans or limits on surcharge fees 
even in the few instances where these efforts have passed the local governing body such as with an ordinance adopted by the city of santa monica  california  federal courts have overturned these local laws on federal preemption grounds 
however  those efforts may resurface and  should the federal courts abandon their adherence to the federal preemption doctrine  those efforts could receive more favorable consideration than in the past 
any successful legislation banning or limiting surcharge fees could result in a substantial loss of revenues and significantly curtail our ability to continue our operations as currently configured 

table of contents in the united kingdom  the treasury select committee of the house of commons published a report regarding surcharges in the atm industry in march this committee was formed to investigate public concerns regarding the atm industry  including adequacy of disclosure to atm customers regarding surcharges  whether atm providers should be required to provide free services in low income areas and whether to limit the level of surcharges 
while the committee made numerous recommendations to parliament regarding the atm industry  including that atms should be subject to the banking code a voluntary code of practice adopted by all financial institutions in the united kingdom  the united kingdom government did not accept the committee s recommendations 
despite the rejection of the committee s recommendations  the united kingdom government did sponsor an atm task force to look at social exclusion in relation to atm services 
as a result of the task force s findings  approximately additional free to use atms to be provided by multiple atm providers were required to be installed in low income areas throughout the united kingdom while this is less than a increase in free to use atms throughout the united kingdom  there is no certainty that other similar proposals will not be made and accepted in the future 
if the legislature or another body with regulatory authority in the united kingdom were to impose limits on the level of surcharges for atm transactions  our revenue from operations in the united kingdom would be negatively impacted 
in mexico  surcharging for off premise atms was legalized in late  but was not formally implemented until july as such  the charging of fees to consumers to utilize off premise atms is a relatively new event in mexico 
accordingly  it is too soon to predict whether public concerns over surcharging will surface in mexico 
however  if such concerns were to be raised  and if the applicable legislative or regulatory bodies in mexico decided to impose limits on the level of surcharges for atm transactions  our revenue from operations in mexico would be negatively impacted 
in october  banco de mexico adopted new rules regarding how atm operators disclose fees to consumers 
the objective of these rules is to provide more transparency to the consumer regarding the cost of a specific atm transaction  rather than to limit the amount of fees charged to the consumer 
the effect of these rules will require atm operators to elect between receiving interchange fees from card issuers or surcharge fees from consumers 
as these new rules only require an atm operator to disclose the total fees charge to a consumer  rather than limit the amount of fees that can be charged to a consumer  we do not anticipate that these new rules will have a material effect on cardtronics mexico s operations 
however  we cannot be sure that additional rulings that limit the amount of fees charged to the consumer or that may be earned on an individual atm transaction will be not adopted in the future 
the passing of legislation requiring modifications to be made to atms could severely impact our cash flows 
under a current decision by the us district court  it was determined that the united states currencies as currently designed violate the rehabilitation act  as the paper currencies issued by the us are identical in size and color  regardless of denomination 
under the decision  the us treasury department has been ordered to develop ways in which to differentiate paper currency such that an individual who is visually impaired would be able to distinguish between the different denominations 
while it is still uncertain at this time what the outcome of the appeals process will be  in the event the current ruling is not overturned  participants in the atm industry including us could be forced to incur costs to upgrade current machines hardware and software components depending on the nature of the modifications proposed by the us treasury department 
noncompliance with established eft network rules and regulations could expose us to fines and penalties and could negatively impact our results of operations 
additionally  new eft network rules and regulations could require us to expend significant amounts of capital to remain in compliance with such rules and regulations 
our transactions are routed over various eft networks to obtain authorization for cash disbursements and to provide account balances 
these networks include star  pulse  nyce  cirrus  and plus in the united states  link in the united kingdom  and prosa red in mexico 
eft networks set the interchange fees that they charge to the financial institutions  as well as the amounts paid to us 
additionally  eft networks  including mastercard and visa  establish rules and regulations that atm providers  including ourselves  must comply with in order for member cardholders to use those atms 
failure to comply with such rules and regulations could expose us to penalties and or fines  which could negatively impact our financial results 
for example  in the united kingdom  mastercard and visa require compliance with the emv security standard 
this standard provides for the security and processing of information contained on microchips imbedded in certain debit and credit cards  known as smart cards 
while we completed our compliance efforts in this regard in  we incurred million in charges earlier that year due to transactions conducted on our machines with counterfeit cards prior to the completion of our emv certification efforts 
in addition to the above  new rules or regulations enacted by the eft networks could require us to expend significant sums of capital to ensure that our atms and financial services kiosks remain in compliance with such rules and regulations 
for example  we expended significant sums of capital in recent years to meet the triple des mandated by mastercard and visa 
similar rules and regulations that may be enacted in the future could result in us having to make additional capital outlays in order to remain in compliance  some of which could be significant 

table of contents the passing of anti money laundering legislation could cause us to lose certain merchant accounts and reduce our revenues 
recent concerns by the us federal government regarding the use of atms to launder money could lead to the imposition of additional regulations on our sponsoring financial institutions and our merchant customers regarding the source of cash loaded into their atms 
in particular  such regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs by individual merchants who load their own cash  thereby making their atms less profitable 
accordingly  some individual merchants may decide to discontinue their atm operations  thus reducing the number of merchant owned accounts that we currently manage 
if such a reduction were to occur  we would see a corresponding decrease in our revenues 
our operating results have fluctuated historically and could continue to fluctuate in the future  which could affect our ability to maintain our current market position or expand 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the atm and financial services industries  changes in payment trends and offerings in the markets in which we operate  competition from other companies providing the same or similar services that we offer  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses  capital expenditures  and expenses related to the expansion of sales  marketing  and operations  including as a result of acquisitions  if any  the timing and magnitude of any impairment charges that may materialize over time relating to our goodwill  intangible assets or long lived assets  changes in the general level of interest rates in the markets in which we operate  changes in regulatory requirements associated with the atm and financial services industries  changes in the mix of our current services  and changes in the financial condition and credit risk of our customers 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we have experienced growth in revenues in recent quarters  this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short term  particularly with respect to personnel expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  and interest expense 
therefore  our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
as such  comparisons to prior periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance
