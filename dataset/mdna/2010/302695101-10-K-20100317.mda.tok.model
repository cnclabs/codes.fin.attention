item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil 
we operate primarily in poland and in the rocky mountains 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
overview we explore for and produce natural gas and crude oil 
our strategy is to achieve growth in production  reserves  and earnings and cash flows through the continued expansion of a high quality portfolio of exploration and development projects in poland 
our polish operations are still early in their development and growth phase  while our us operations are relatively mature 
beginning in  our results began to show substantial changes and improvement as we began oil and gas production in poland 
in  with the commencement of production at our roszkow well and our current facilities construction to place previously drilled wells into production  we now expect poland to be the primary source of company revenues for the foreseeable future 
see results of operations by business segment below 
strategy our objective is to continue our strong historic growth trend compound annual growth rate in proved reserves value from to to deliver superior value to our shareholders 
we primarily focus on organic growth from exploration and development drilling on our own prospects 
we concentrate on areas where we believe we have a strategic competitive advantage and which we believe offer superior returns 
our core operating area is the permian basin of western poland 
we believe poland is a unique international exploration opportunity 
relatively little gas has been discovered in poland s sector of the north european permian basin  compared to the discoveries in the united kingdom  dutch  and german sectors 
for most of the twentieth century  poland was closed to exploration by foreign oil and gas companies 
consequently  we think the polish permian basin is underexplored and underexploited and  therefore  has high potential for discovering significant amounts of oil and gas 
oil and gas reserves as a result of our ongoing drilling and production successes in poland  was the sixth consecutive year that we reported record year end proved reserve values 
the following table highlights year end reserve volumes and values and shows the change from to change in thousands proved reserve volumes gas reserves mcf oil reserves bbls total reserves mcfe proved reserve values reserves pv value the natural gas discovery at the kromolice well contributed the greatest portion of our year over year increase in proved reserves 
at year end  gross proved reserves for the well were estimated at approximately bcf of gas bcf net to our interest 
we also recorded new reserves of bcf at our grabowka re entry project  where we own of the concession 
in addition to these two new projects  we also recorded upward revisions of approximately  barrels of oil in the united states  primarily due to higher oil prices resulting in more economically recoverable barrels 
these additions were partially offset by negative revisions at our wilga well  which stopped producing in late we are planning to plug the well and dismantle the facilities during operating and financial results the oil and gas industry had a challenging year in due to the prolonged recession and commodity price volatility 
many companies in our industry were unable to react to these conditions and are facing significant challenges to their ability to survive 
stock prices for most companies our size continued to experience declines and depressed levels 
despite these conditions  we were able to reach record year end production levels  move forward on two important development projects  pursue additional exploration opportunities which resulted in the sixth consecutive year of growth in the value of our proved reserves  and position ourselves for continued growth in without diluting our shareholders interests or incurring additional debt in we believe we have adequate liquidity to continue our growth pattern in our operational and financial highlights included the following the discovery of commercial gas reserves at the kromolice well  the completion of production facilities and the commencement of production at our roszkow well  which is currently producing at a rate of mmcfd mmcfd net to us  a rate that we expect to be constant for at least the next three years  the sixth consecutive year of proved reserves value growth  record fourth quarter production and year end production rates  initial progress on the design of our ksk production facilities  which we expect to increase our daily production by approximately mmcfd day when production commences  scheduled for late  approvals to begin work on our winna gora production facility  scheduled for completion during  the completion of a new d seismic project in our core fences area  the identification of new drill sites in our core fences area  the design of a development plan at our zakowo project in block  a net operating loss of million  compared with a net operating loss of million for  and net cash used in operations of million  compared to million for we ended the year with total proved reserves of bcfe  compared with bcfe at the end of see proved reserves discussion below 
adapting to global economic conditions our business in was negatively impacted by the recession that began in and continues to impact world economies  as well as by the changes in the credit markets and ongoing volatile commodity prices 
during late and throughout  we took steps  particularly in areas in which we have some control  to maintain our liquidity in response to the ongoing uncertainty  without diluting our shareholders interests 
as a result of our actions  some of which are described below  we believe we have weathered much of the economic storm and are poised to achieve significant progress on several fronts in capital and operating budgets 
other than for capital projects that were committed and in process at year end  we determined  in consultation with our partner  pogc  to not initiate new capital projects in until the commencement of production at our roszkow well in poland  which began in september 
increased production and cash flow should allow us to begin new capital projects during we took steps to reduce our operating budget 
for the year  we reduced our cash overhead costs by approximately from budgeted levels  primarily by reducing compensation costs 
we further reduced cash overhead costs by from budgeted amounts  again by reducing compensation and other controllable costs 
we closely monitor lease operating costs and are working with our partner in poland to implement efficiencies where possible 
we are also continuing to seek reductions in third party drilling costs and services 
credit markets 
we have a million senior facility agreement with the royal bank of scotland  or rbs  in london  england 
we are in compliance with all of the terms of the facility and are in active discussions to extend and expand the terms and size of the facility 
we believe we have reserve volumes and values that would warrant a sizable increase in the facility and have received proposals for a larger new credit facility 
we determined to defer refinancing  rather than to press forward during for the following reasons interest rates seemed to be abnormally elevated given then current economic conditions and our reserve position  rates under our existing facility were extremely low compared to then current and present rates  and we did not have a pressing need for any new debt capacity 
we believe our patience has been rewarded 
current interest rates for a facility of our desired size appear to be significantly lower than they were a few months ago 
with the construction of our ksk facilities scheduled for this summer and a need for additional debt financing  we are now engaged in new facility discussions 
we are seeking to refinance our existing facility  increase the size of the facility  and extend the maturity dates 
in early  we signed a mandate letter with rbs  authorizing it to proceed with the expansion of our existing facility to million 
as part of the refinance process  rbs reset the date of the first rescheduled principal reduction of our existing facility to may  equity markets 
we have traditionally funded our exploration programs  both in poland and in the united states  through the issuance of equity 
while we believe that the equity markets are accessible  we have been unwilling to issue new equity at stock prices that we believe do not adequately reflect our underlying value 
commodity prices 
global oil prices continued to be volatile during gas prices in the united states decreased significantly for much of the european gas market operates quite differently than the us domestic market 
in poland  all of our gas production is sold to pogc and is tied to published tariffs set by the public utility regulator from time to time for gas sold to wholesale consumers 
during  the polish regulator reduced low methane tariffs by in response to the global recession 
since that time  gas prices have remained constant 
a major component of the tariff calculation is the cost of russian imported gas  which in turn is priced based on trailing oil prices 
with the recent volatility in oil prices  the cost of imported gas may decline  which in turn may cause the polish regulator to decrease the cost of gas sold by pogc and thereby reduce the price we receive  however  other major components of the tariff calculation include the cost of gas provided by pogc itself  as well as the necessity for pogc to cover its internal cost structure 
natural gas prices in poland are  and for years have been  below european union average prices for both households and industry  because the prices have been subsidized by the government 
european union rules require poland to abandon market subsidies and bring polish gas prices to free market levels 
in addition  poland was the only country in europe to record positive gdp growth during  and economists predict another positive year during these factors may act as cushions against possible declines in prices 
as of year end  gas prices in poland remained firm and were higher than those of an equivalent btu content in the united states 
there was no significant price impact on the value and volumes of our gas reserves in poland from to however  our gas reserves are price sensitive  and future material reductions in the prices at which we sell our gas in poland could result in the impairment of reserves 
property impairments during the third quarter of  production ceased at our wilga well in eastern poland 
accordingly  we impaired the remaining million in capital costs associated with the well at that time 
this impairment was a noncash charge and was offset by revisions to our asset retirement obligations 
foreign currency volatility we enter into various agreements in poland denominated in the polish zloty 
the exchange rate between the us dollar and the polish zloty is subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control 
during  the zloty fluctuated between a low of zlotys per us dollar to a high of zlotys per dollar 
variations in exchange rates affect the us dollar denominated amount of revenue we receive in polish zlotys 
as the us dollar strengthens  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys declines  conversely  when the us dollar weakens  our us dollar denominated revenue received in polish zlotys increases 
should exchange rates in effect during early continue throughout the year  we expect the exchange rates to have a slightly positive impact on our us dollar denominated revenues compared to at the same time  however  our us dollar denominated costs of conducting business in poland  which include drilling  geological and geophysical  and overhead costs  will also change as exchange rates fluctuate 
we are also generating revenues in poland in polish zlotys  and we keep those zlotys in poland and use them to pay zloty based invoices 
our policy is to reduce currency risk by  under ordinary circumstances and when necessary  transferring dollars to zlotys or fixing the exchange rate for future transfers of dollars to zlotys  on or about the occasion of making significant commitments payable in polish currency  taking into consideration the future timing and amounts of committed costs and the estimated timing and amounts of zloty based revenues 
effective october   we changed the functional currency of our polish subsidiary from the us dollar to the polish zloty 
accounting standards require the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of a foreign operation to be measured using the functional currency of that foreign operation 
because fx energy poland s functional currency is now the polish zloty  translation adjustments will result from the process of translating its financial statements into the us dollar reporting currency 
translation adjustments will not be included in determining net income  but shall be reported separately and accumulated in other comprehensive income 
the accounting basis of the assets and liabilities affected by the change are adjusted to reflect the difference between the exchange rate when the asset or liability arose and the exchange rate on the date of the change 
upon the change in functional currency  we recorded a cumulative translation adjustment cta of approximately million  which is shown in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity deficit 
because of the change in exchange rates between reporting periods and changes in certain account balances  the cta will change from period to period 
at december  and  the cta was approximately million and million  respectively  reflecting the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the change in functional currency will also affect the amounts we report for our polish assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses from those that would be reported had we maintained the us dollar as the functional currency for our polish operations 
the differences will depend on changes in period average and period end exchange rates 
during  we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of approximately million  in  we recorded foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million 
these gains or losses are principally attributable to changes in the amount of polish zlotys necessary to satisfy outstanding intercompany dollar denominated loans and unpaid interest to fx energy  inc future transaction gains or losses may be significant given the amount of intercompany loans and the volatility of the exchange rate 
the change in functional currency will have no impact on our actual zloty based revenues and expenditures in poland 
oil and gas revenues and pricing production from our roszkow well  which began producing at a rate of mmcfd in september  more than offset expected declines at our wilga well 
however  lower average prices for both oil and gas  coupled with a decrease in our drilling services revenues  led to reductions in both oil and gas sales and total revenues 
the following table highlights revenues  production volumes  and oil and gas pricing  showing the change from to change in thousands revenues oil gas sales total revenues production gas production mcf oil production bbls total production mcfe pricing average gas prices per mcf average oil prices per bbl we expect to see significant increases in both production and oil and gas revenues during as we record a full year s production from our roszkow well  which is projected to average approximately mmcfd mmcfd net to our interest for the entire year 
results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production  or e p  segment in poland and the united states  and the oilfield services segment in the united states 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion

see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail concerning our segment results 
exploration and production segment gas revenues 
revenues from gas sales were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
our gas revenues increased from levels by approximately million due to higher production  offset by approximately million due to lower year over year gas prices 
gas revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher gas prices  offset by approximately million related to production declines 
two new wells began production during production commenced at our roszkow well in late september at a rate of mmcfd mmcfd net to our interest 
gas is being sold to pogc at a contracted rate equal to of the published low methane tariff 
as of december   the net price for gas at the roszkow well was per mmcf 
production also began during the third quarter of at our grabowka well 
pl energia  a gas distribution company in poland  is the purchaser of the gas from the grabowka field 
under a three well re entry program  gas is sold at a fixed rate of approximately per mmcf approximately per million btus based on methane content 
this price  which is lower than the current market price  was agreed upon in order to compensate the buyer for bearing all of the cost and risk of re entering and completing the wells and paying for construction of the production facilities 
gas is being compressed and transported by truck 
the combination of the purchaser provided financing of all development costs and the lower than normal gas price effectively creates economic outcome and risk similar to a royalty interest for us 
we ceased production at our wilga well in eastern poland  despite repeated workover attempts during the third quarter of we have impaired the remaining capitalized costs at wilga and are planning to plug the well and dismantle the production facility 
although the polish low methane tariff averaged about higher during compared to  average us dollar denominated gas prices related to our poland production decreased from to the average exchange rate during was zlotys per us dollar  compared with zlotys per us dollar during  a change of 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for gas revenues  average gas prices  gas production volumes  and lifting costs per mcf for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per mcf percent change versus prior year production volumes mcf percent change versus prior year lifting costs per mcf percent change versus prior year lifting costs per mcf are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total volume of gas produced 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
significantly lower average oil prices in compared to was the primary cause for the decline in revenues 
our average oil price during was per barrel  a decrease compared to per barrel received during in addition  oil production at wilga declined  as expected  by from to production from our us properties declined by due to normal production declines 
included in oil revenues were approximately   and million related to the sale of oil at the wilga well for the years ended december    and  respectively 
all other oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
us oil revenues in decreased from levels by approximately million due to lower oil prices  in addition to approximately  related to production declines 
us oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately million due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil revenues  average oil prices  oil production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel for the years ended december    and  is set forth in the following table in thousands  except for prices and percentages for the year ended december  revenues percent change versus prior year average price per bbl percent change versus prior year production volumes bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per bbl percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
light crude oil lifting costs in poland are based on an allocation of total costs based on relative revenues between oil and gas 
lifting costs include production taxes incurred in the united states 
lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in  million in  and million in operating costs increased slightly in with the commencement of production at our roszkow well 
operating costs decreased slightly in from as we negotiated lower indirect costs at our non operated properties in poland 
exploration costs 
exploration expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs as well as the costs of exploratory dry holes 
exploration costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during all three years  most of our g g costs were spent on acquiring  processing  and interpreting new d and d seismic data in the fences area in poland 
exploratory dry hole costs were million  million  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we drilled one dry hole in nevada 
during  we drilled three shallow dry holes  two in montana and one in nevada 
during  all wells drilled during the year were determined to be commercial and were completed for future production 
impairment costs 
impairments of oil and gas properties were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as discussed previously  production at our wilga well ceased during  and we impaired its remaining capital costs and offset the impairment by million related to revisions of our asset retirement obligations 
during we impaired million and million related to our grundy and sroda wells in poland  respectively  and an additional million related to our producing properties in montana 
during we impaired million related to our wilga well due to negative reserve revisions that resulted in lower estimated future net revenues 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our and impairments 
dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease from to arose primarily because we impaired the bulk of capital costs associated with our domestic oil properties during  which reduced the depletion base for the decrease from to resulted primarily from the million impairment in for our wilga well  as those costs were removed from our depletion base 
future dd a costs are expected to generally  but not completely  follow future production trends 
however  future dd a rates can be very different depending upon future capitalized costs 
oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we drilled wells for third parties during  along with additional well service work  compared to wells during however  all but two of the wells drilled in were shallow wells that can be drilled in two to three days and generate less revenue per well 
we drilled wells for third parties during oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
we cannot accurately predict future oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  or   and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
the year to year decrease from to was primarily due to the nature of our drilling activity discussed above 
the increase in costs from to was primarily due to increased drilling activity 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are closely associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our own properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during   and respectively 
these capital additions resulted in higher dd a expenses for this segment during and bad debt expense oilfield services 
bad debt expense was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we wrote off as uncollectable  related to revenue recognized during for third party drilling services 
this was the first bad debt charged to expense in our history 
we incurred no bad debt charges in  and do not expect to incur further bad debt charges in the future 
nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our g a costs rose from levels primarily due to higher accounting and insurance costs 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in   and stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in   and stock compensation expense recorded for represents million of amortization related to restricted stock granted in   and and  of amortization of unvested stock options granted prior to interest and other income expense corporate 
interest and other income expense was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we amortized  related to fees incurred in securing our senior credit facility 
we also paid  in interest on outstanding borrowings 
these interest related costs were offset by interest income of  during  we amortized  related to fees incurred in securing our senior credit facility to interest expense and paid  in commitment fees for the facility 
we also paid  in interest on outstanding borrowings 
these interest related costs were offset by interest income of  during  amortized fees and semiannual commitment fees for the facility totaled  in interest related charges 
these charges offset interest income of  foreign exchange 
as discussed previously  we incurred foreign exchange gains of million and foreign exchange losses of million and gains of  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
included in the gain and loss were million and million  respectively  related to mark to market and settlement adjustments to polish zloty forward contracts 
income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accounting standards require that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
proved reserves we have historically added reserves through our exploration and development activities see items and  business and properties 
changes in proved reserves were as follows mmcfe proved reserves beginning of year extensions  discoveries  and other additions revisions of previous estimates production proved reserves end of year extensions  discoveries  and other additions 
these are additions to proved reserves that result from the discovery of new fields with proved reserves 
revisions 
revisions represent changes in previous reserves estimates  either upward or downward  resulting from new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in economic factors  such as commodity prices  operating costs  or development costs 
revisions at year end included positive oil revisions due to higher crude oil prices  offset by negative gas revisions due to the cessation of production at our wilga well 
at year end  positive gas revisions in poland were attributable to our sroda and zaniemysl wells due to additional technical data acquired during  while negative oil revisions were due to lower year end oil prices in the united states 
at year end  negative oil and gas revisions in poland were attributable to our wilga well due to water encroachment  while positive oil revisions due to higher year end oil prices in the united states 
production 
see gas revenues and oil revenues above 
liquidity and capital resources throughout our history  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
in addition  cash flow from our production operations has been providing a portion of our capital expenditures for the past three years 
we have a history of operating losses 
from our inception in january through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we expect that our exploration and production activities may continue to result in net losses through and possibly beyond  depending on the success of our drilling activities in poland and the united states and whether we generate sufficient revenues to cover related operating expenses 
while revenues from our operations exceed our fixed operating and overhead costs  we have reported negative cash flow from operating activities in each of the past three years 
with the establishment of proved reserves in poland  in november  we established a million senior credit facility with the royal bank of scotland to fund infrastructure and development costs in poland 
as of december   we had drawn down the full million available under this facility 
at december   we had working capital of approximately million 
in early  we signed a mandate letter with rbs  authorizing it to proceed with the expansion of our existing facility to million 
as part of the refinance process  rbs reset the date of the first rescheduled principal reduction of our existing facility to may  while we did not experience significant impacts from the economic crisis during  the global economy continues to be unsteady 
however  the strengthening of the polish zloty against the us dollar over the past few months will  if it continues  have a positive impact on our us dollar denominated future revenues and net operating profit  conversely  any us dollar denominated capital  exploration  and operating costs in poland will increase at the same rate 
based on current conditions  we presently expect our exploration and development programs will continue in spite of the economic downturn  however  in recognition of the downturn  we plan to continue  as we did throughout  matching capital spending with our discretionary cash flow  plus increased debt capacity when it becomes available 
as of december   we had no firm commitments for future capital and exploration costs 
we have the ability to control the timing and amount of all of our future capital and exploration costs 
despite the fact that we have no firm commitments  we are moving ahead with production facilities for our ksk wells 
we expect the facilities to be complete and ready for production to begin in late absent additional debt capacity  which we expect to finalize during the second quarter of  we will pay for the facilities from our projected cash flow in poland 
we cannot assure that our efforts to increase borrowings will be successful  however  should we be unable to finalize the credit expansion  our existing cash balances  coupled with expected cash flow in poland  will provide adequate funding to make the repayment and still fund the ksk production facilities 
we may seek to obtain additional funds for future capital investments from the sale of additional securities  project financing to help finance the completion of successful wells  sale of partial property interests  or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we will allocate our existing capital as well as funds we may obtain in the future among our various projects at our discretion 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition  and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   a decrease of million from december  operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million  and million in our operating activities during   and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses  excluding noncash charges  incurred in those years 
lower exploration costs in  which were reduced intentionally as we matched our spending with our cash flow  helped reduce the cash used during our current assets at year end included approximately million in accrued oil and gas sales from both the united states and poland and million in receivables related to our oilfield services segment 
our current liabilities at year end included approximately million in costs related to our exploration activities in poland that were paid in early  as well as million in vat value added tax payables that were also satisfied in early investing activities 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in  we received million from the maturities of marketable securities and invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and million adding to our oilfield services equipment 
in  we received million from the maturities of marketable securities and invested  in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and million adding to our oilfield services equipment 
in  we received million from the maturities of marketable securities and invested million in marketable securities 
we spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and  adding to our oilfield services equipment 
financing activities 
we used net cash in financing activities of million during we received net cash from financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
during  we paid million towards a loan related to auction rate securities 
in addition   options and warrants were exercised during the year  resulting in proceeds to us of  during  we borrowed million under our senior credit facility with rbs and million as a loan related to auction rate securities  of which  was repaid by december  in addition   options and warrants were exercised  resulting in proceeds to us of million 
during  we sold million shares of stock in a registered direct offering  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
in addition   options and warrants were exercised during the year  resulting in proceeds to us of an additional million 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments contractual obligations 
at december   the aggregate amounts of our contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows total in thousands senior credit facility interest payments on long term debt we had no other significant contractual obligations or commitments as of december  we are subject to certain work commitments respecting our owned exploration concessions that must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
these work commitments are optional on our part  however  they must be satisfied in order to maintain our interest in those concessions 
our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage  suspension of operations  personal injury  and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states and poland operations and also rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration partners in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling  and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
asset retirement obligation 
we have liabilities of million related to asset retirement obligations on our consolidated balance sheet at december   excluded from the table above 
due to the nature of these obligations  we cannot determine precisely when the payments will be made to settle these obligations 
new accounting pronouncements recent securities and exchange commission rule making activity in december  the securities and exchange commission announced that it had approved revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements 
the most significant amendments to the requirements included the following commodity prices economic producibility of reserves and discounted cash flows are now based on a month average commodity price unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used  rather than a year end price 
disclosure of unproved reserves probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis 
proved undeveloped reserves guidelines reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
third party reserves preparation if a company represents that its estimates of reserves are prepared or audited by a third party  the company must file a report of the third party as an exhibit to the relevant registration statement or report 
use of probabilistic methods reserves may be estimated using probabilistic methods in which there is at least a probability of recovery of proved reserves  at least a probability of recovery of probable reserves  and at least a probability of recovery of possible reserves 
disclosure by geographic area reserves in foreign countries or continents must be presented separately if they represent more than of total oil and gas proved reserves 
we adopted the rules effective december  see supplemental oil and gas information unaudited for impact of adoption on oil and gas reserves 
in addition  in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new standards to provide consistency with the new securities and exchange commission rules 
the new standards align the reserves calculation and disclosure requirements under us generally accepted accounting principles with the requirements in the securities and exchange commission rules 
we adopted the new standards effective december  the new standards are applied prospectively as a change in estimate 
see  also  supplemental oil and gas information unaudited 
on january   we adopted a new accounting standard regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new standard requires enhanced disclosure about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued three amendments to the accounting and disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities 
these amendments provide guidelines for making fair value measurements more consistent with the principles presented in prior pronouncements  enhance consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures  and provide additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
we adopted these for the period ended june  in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification codification 
the codification will become the single source for all authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after september  the adoption of the codification does not change gaap 
in may  the fasb issued new standards that establish the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date  but before financial statements are issued 
in particular  the new standards set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements through the date that the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
we adopted the new standards as of june  we have evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of december   through the time of filing with the securities and exchange commission 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements regarding the determination of the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
this amendment was effective october  in all cases referenced above  the adoption of the new rules or standards did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that net capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not considered to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
gains and losses are recognized on sales of entire interests in proved and unproved properties 
sales of partial interests are generally treated as a recovery of costs and any resulting gain or loss is recorded as other income 
revenues associated with oil and gas sales are recorded when title passes  which is upon delivery to the pipeline or purchaser  and are net of royalties 
oilfield service revenues are recognized when the related service is performed 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
oil and gas reserves all of the reserves data in this form k are estimates 
estimates of our crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by our engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission  including the recent rule revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements  which we adopted effective december  reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserves estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  economic producibility of reserves is dependent on the oil and gas prices used in the reserves estimate 
we based our december   reserves estimates on a month average commodity price  unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used  in accordance with securities and exchange commission rules 
however  oil and gas prices are volatile and  as a result  our reserves estimates will change in the future 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect our dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also cause us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge  which would reduce earnings
