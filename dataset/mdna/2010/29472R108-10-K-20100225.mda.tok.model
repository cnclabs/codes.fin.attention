raised annual dividend to per share in  up from per share in paid off maturing mortgages totaling approximately million  funded with approximately million of new and refinanced debt on six properties 
overview and outlook occupancy in our properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates directly affects revenues 
our revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting our sites on a long term basis 
we have approximately  annual sites  approximately  seasonal sites  which are leased to customers generally for three to six months  and approximately  transient sites  occupied by customers who lease sites on a short term basis 
the revenue from seasonal and transient sites is generally higher during the first and third quarters 
we expect to service over  customers at our transient sites and we consider this revenue stream to be our most volatile 
it is subject to weather conditions  gas prices  and other factors affecting the marginal rv customer s vacation and travel preferences 
finally  we have approximately  sites designated as right to use sites which are primarily utilized to service the approximately  customers who own right to use contracts 
we also have interests in properties containing approximately  sites for which revenue is classified as equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations 
total sites as of dec 
 rounded to s community sites resort sites annual seasonal transient right to use joint ventures includes sites from discontinued operations 
includes approximately  sites rented on an annual basis 
joint venture income is included in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 
a significant portion of our rental agreements on community sites are directly or indirectly tied to published cpi statistics that are issued during june through september each year 
we currently expect our 
table of contents community base rental income to increase approximately as compared to we have already notified approximately of our community site customers with rent increases reflecting this revenue growth 
our home sales volumes and gross profits have been declining since we believe that the disruption in the site built housing market may be contributing to the decline in our home sales operations as potential customers are not able to sell their existing site built homes as well as increased price sensitivity for seasonal and second homebuyers 
we believe that our potential customers are also having difficulty obtaining financing on resort homes  resort cottages and rv purchases 
there are few options for potential customers who seek to obtain manufactured home financing 
the options that are available currently require at least a down payment and interest rates ranging from approximately to 
this is in contrast to purchasers of site built homes  who own the underlying land and that may benefit from various government stimulus packages designed to keep interest rates and down payments low 
the continued decline in homes sales activity resulted in our decision to significantly reduce our new homes sales operation during the last couple of months of and until such time as new home sales markets improve 
we believe that renting our vacant new homes may represent an attractive source of occupancy and potentially convert to a new homebuyer in the future 
we are also focusing on smaller  more energy efficient and more affordable homes in our manufactured home properties 
we also believe that some customers that are capable of purchasing are opting instead to rent due to the current economic environment 
our rental operations have been increasing since for the year ended december   occupied manufactured home rentals increased to  or  from for the year ended december  net operating income increased to approximately million in from approximately million in we believe that unlike the home sales business  at this time we compete effectively with other types of rentals ie apartments 
we are currently evaluating whether we want to continue to invest in additional rental units 
in our resort properties  we continue to work on extending customer stays 
we have had success converting transient customers to seasonal customers and seasonal customers to annual customers 
we also have and continue to introduce low cost products that focus on the installed base of almost eight million rv owners 
such products may include right to use contracts that entitle the purchasers to use certain properties the agreements 
several different agreements are currently offered to new customers 
these front line agreements are generally distinguishable from each other by the number of properties a customer can access 
the agreements generally grant the customer the contractual right to use designated space within the properties on a continuous basis for up to days 
the agreements generally require nonrefundable upfront payments as well as annual payments 
existing customers may be offered an upgrade agreement from time to time 
the upgrade agreement is currently distinguishable from a new agreement that a customer would enter into by increased length of consecutive stay by ie up to days  ability to make earlier advance reservations  discounts on rental units and access to additional properties  which may include discounts at non membership rv properties 
each upgrade requires an additional nonrefundable upfront payment 
the company may finance the upfront nonrefundable payment under any agreement 
government stimulus in response to recent market disruptions  legislators and financial regulators implemented a number of mechanisms designed to add stability to the financial markets  including the provision of direct and indirect assistance to distressed financial institutions  assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker dealers  implementation of programs by the federal reserve to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets and temporary prohibitions on short sales of certain financial institution securities 
numerous actions have been taken by the federal reserve  congress  us treasury  the sec and others to address the current liquidity and credit crisis that has followed the sub prime crisis that commenced in these measures include  but are not limited to various legislative and regulatory efforts  homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity 
table of contents and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  including two basis point decreases in october of  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
it is not clear at this time what impact these liquidity and funding initiatives of the federal reserve and other agencies that have been previously announced  and any additional programs that may be initiated in the future will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced  or on the us banking and financial industries and the broader us and global economies 
the company believes that programs intended to provide relief to current or potential site built single family homeowners negatively impacts its business 
further  the overall effects of the legislative and regulatory efforts on the financial markets is uncertain  and they may not have the intended stabilization effects 
should these legislative or regulatory initiatives fail to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
even if legislative or regulatory initiatives or other efforts successfully stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  we may need to modify our strategies  businesses or operations  and we may incur increased capital requirements and constraints or additional costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment 
it is uncertain what effects recently enacted or future legislation or regulatory initiatives will have on us 
given the volatile nature of the current market disruption and the uncertainties underlying efforts to mitigate or reverse the disruption  we may not timely anticipate or manage existing  new or additional risks  contingencies or developments  including regulatory developments and trends in new products and services  in the current or future environment 
our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects

long lived assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 we allocated the purchase price of properties we acquired on or prior to december  to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired

that the acquisition method of accounting also known as the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
fasb asc replaces  with limited exceptions as specified in the statement  the cost allocation process in sfas no 
with a fair value based allocation process 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  including our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we generally use a year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements including site development  a ten year estimated life for building upgrades and a five year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
new rental units are generally depreciated using a year estimated life from each model year down to a salvage value of of the original costs 
used rental units are generally depreciated based on the estimated life of the unit with no estimated salvage value 
the values of above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease 
the value associated with in place leases is amortized over the expected term  which includes an estimated probability of lease renewal 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life 
revenue recognition the company accounts for leases with its customers as operating leases

a right to use contract gives the customer the right to a set schedule of usage at a specified group of properties 
customers may choose to upgrade their contracts to increase their usage and the number of properties they may access 
a contract 
table of contents requires the customer to make an upfront nonrefundable payment and annual payments during the term of the contract 
the stated term of a right to use contract is generally three years and the customer may renew his contract by continuing to make the annual payments 
the company will recognize the upfront non refundable payments over the estimated customer life which  based on historical attrition rates  the company has estimated to be from one to years 
for example  we have currently estimated that of customers who purchase a new right to use contract will terminate their contract after five years 
therefore  the upfront nonrefundable payments from of the contracts sold in any particular period are amortized on a straight line basis over a period of five years as the estimated customer life for of our customers who purchase a contract is five years 
the historical attrition rates for upgrade contracts are lower than for new contacts  and therefore  the nonrefundable upfront payments for upgrade contracts are amortized at a different rate than for new contracts 
the decision to recognize this revenue in accordance with fasb asc was made after corresponding with the office of the chief accountant at the sec during september and october of right to use annual payments paid by customers under the terms of the right to use contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the one year period in which the services are provided

our provision for uncollectible rents receivable was approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
we may also finance the sale of homes to our customers through loans referred to as chattel loans 
the valuation of an allowance for doubtful accounts for the chattel loans is calculated based on delinquency trends and a comparison of the outstanding principal balance of each note compared to the nada national automobile dealers association value and the current market value of the underlying manufactured home collateral 
a bad debt expense is recorded in home selling expense in our consolidated statements of operations

the statement requires  among other provisions  the disclosure  clear labeling and presentation of non controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
per fasb asc  a non controlling interest is the portion of equity net assets in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
the ownership interests in the subsidiary that are held by owners other than the parent are non controlling interests 
under fasb asc  such non controlling interests are reported on the consolidated balance sheets within equity  separately from the company s equity 
however  securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets at the option of the holder  not solely within the control of the issuer  must be classified outside of permanent equity

inflation substantially all of the leases at the properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases  where justified by the market  as each lease matures 
such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the company 
in addition  our resort properties are not generally subject to leases and rents are established for these sites on an annual basis 
our right to use contracts generally provide for an annual dues increase  but dues may be frozen under the terms of certain contracts if the customer is over years old 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is generally an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
we define ffo as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or actual or estimated losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we receive up front non refundable payments from the sale of right to use contracts 
in accordance with gaap  the upfront non refundable payments and related commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer life 
although the nareit definition of ffo does not address the treatment of nonrefundable right to use payments  we believe that it is appropriate to adjust for the impact of the deferral activity in our calculation of ffo 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or actual or estimated losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
we believe that the adjustment to ffo for the net revenue deferral of upfront non refundable payments and expense deferral of right to use contract commissions also facilitates the comparison to other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and 
table of contents should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates 
the primary market risk we face is long term indebtedness  which bears interest at fixed and variable rates 
the fair value of our long term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately or approximately billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures 
for each increase in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
for each decrease in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
at december   none of our outstanding debt was short term and at variable rates
