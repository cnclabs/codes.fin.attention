overview sales for the year ended september  were million compared with million for fiscal the company reported net earnings for fiscal of million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of  or per diluted share  for fiscal net earnings increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a increase in sales volume  reflecting the increase in orders for fiscal  as well as lower operating expenses of million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal  due to cost reduction measures 
these favorable changes were partially offset by a decline in gross margins from in fiscal to in fiscal due to competitive pricing pressures and a lower margin product mix

orders for automated inspection systems increased  process system orders increased  and parts and service orders increased over the prior fiscal year 
the primary market forces driving demand for our products are the increased global concerns about food safety and security  the inability of food and pharmaceutical processors to obtain cost effective labor  and the company s continued expansion into international markets 
export and international sales for the fiscal years ended september   and accounted for  and of net sales in each year  respectively 
while the worldwide economy and tight credit markets continued to challenge the company s fiscal results  order volumes for fiscal were up across most of the company s significant geographic markets and major product lines  particularly in the potato industry and other less significant applications including tobacco and nuts 
the continued economic uncertainty during the fiscal year resulted in some increased  yet conservative  capital spending throughout our markets as customers evaluated the potential economic effects on their business 
customers seeking to retain cash  price sensitivity  longer or delayed purchasing cycle processes  and more purchasing decisions being made at corporate levels  as compared to local operating locations  continued in fiscal customers who had relied on credit facilities to finance capital purchases were still often constrained by the lack of readily available credit 
in addition  in response to the resulting excess capacity  the market saw very aggressive pricing efforts to stimulate demand  which increased the competitive pricing pressure on the company

application of critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies  the application of which may materially affect the financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require management judgment to make estimates and assumptions in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories long lived assets allowances for warranties accounting for income taxes management has discussed the development  selection and related disclosures of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all criteria are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by the company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
sales of system upgrades are recognized as revenue upon completion of the conversion of the customer s existing system when this conversion occurs at the customer site 
revenue earned from services maintenance  installation support  and repairs is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
if any contract provides for both equipment and services multiple deliverables  the sales price is allocated to the various elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
each element is then evaluated for revenue recognition based on the previously described criteria 
the company s sales arrangements provide for no other significant post shipment obligations 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
in the event of revenue deferral  the sale value is not recorded as revenue to the company  accounts receivable are reduced by any related amounts owed by the customer  and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary 
historically  the company has experienced few sales returns 
the company accounts for cash consideration such as sales incentives that are given to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless an identified benefit is received for which fair value can be reasonably estimate d 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale vary significantly  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to recognize or defer revenue based on those terms 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
at september   the company had invoiced million compared to million at september  for which the company has not recognized revenue 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and customers historical payment patterns 
factors that affect collectability of receivables include general economic or political factors in certain countries that affect the ability of customers to meet current obligations 
the company actively manages its credit risk by utilizing an independent credit rating and reporting service  by requiring certain percentages of down payments  and by requiring secured forms of payment for customers with uncertain credit profiles or located in c ertain countries 
forms of secured payment could include irrevocable letters of credit  bank guarantees  third party leasing arrangements or ex im bank guarantees  each utilizing uniform commercial code filings  or the like  with governmental entities where possible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management judgment in making assumptions relative to customer or general economic factors that are outside the company s control 
as of september   the balance sheet included allowances for doubtful accounts of  amounts charged to bad debt expense for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
actual charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
if the company experiences actual bad debt expense in excess of estim ates  or if estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  the carrying value of accounts receivable would decrease and charges for bad debts would increase  resulting in decreased net earnings 
in addition  in fiscal  the company established a  allowance against the full amount of the company s notes receivable from the fiscal sale of its interest in the inspx joint venture 
during fiscal  the company collected the full amount 
of the amounts collected   was recorded as income upon the reversal of the related allowance in fiscal  and  in fiscal valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s inventory includes purchased raw materials  manufactured components  purchased components  service and repair parts  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment 
write downs for excess and obsolete inventories are made after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
 the company actively manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining low safety stocks and minimum purchase lots  utilizing just in time purchasing practices  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing to sales to production to after sale support 
at september   cumulative inventory adjustments to lower of cost or market totaled million compared to million as of september  amounts charged to expense to record inventory at lower of cost or market for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
actual charges to the cumulative inventory adjustments upon disposition or sale of inventory were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs  and a decrease to gross margins 
long lived assets 
the company regularly reviews all of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets is recorded 
in addition  goodwill is reviewed based on its fair value at least annually 
as of september   the company held million of long lived assets  net of depreciation and amortization 
there were no changes in the company s long liv ed assets that would result in an adjustment of the carrying value for these assets 
estimates of future cash flows arising from the utilization of these long lived assets and estimated useful lives associated with the assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generated throughout the lives of several product lines over extended periods of time  and the potential effect that recognizing an impairment could have on the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the potential material adverse effect on reported earnings or loss 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reductio n to the carrying value and a reduction to net earnings in the affected period 
allowances for warranties 
the company s products are covered by standard warranty plans included in the price of the products ranging from days to five years  depending upon the product and contractual terms of sale 
the company establishes allowances for warranties for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  warranty claims based on contractual terms  product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line 
company products include both manufactured and purchased components and  therefore  warranty plans include third party sourced parts which may not be covered by the third party manufacturer s warranty 
ultimately  the warranty experience of the company is directly attributable to the quality of it s products 
the company actively manages its quality program by using a structured product introduction plan  process monitoring techniques utilizing statistical process controls  vendor quality metrics  and feedback loops to communicate warranty claims to designers and engineers for remediation in future production 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to significant fluctuation period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future warranty claims relative to potential unknown issues arising in both existing and new products  which assumptions are derived from historical trends of known or resolved issues  and risks associated with third party supplied components being manufactured using processes that the company does not control 
as of september   the balance sheet included warranty reserve s of million  while million of warranty charges were incurred during the fiscal year then ended  compared to warranty reserves of million as of september  and warranty charges of million for the fiscal year then ended 
if the company s actual warranty costs are higher than estimates  future warranty plan coverages are different  or estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  reserves for warranty expense would need to increase  warranty expense would increase and gross margins would decrease 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based partially upon estimates of pre tax financial accounting income for the full year and is affected by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in management s judgment  when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
at september   the company had valuation reserves of approximately  for deferred tax assets for capital loss carryforwards and the valuation impairment and other charges in carrying value of its investment in proditec  and offsetting amounts for us and chinese deferred tax assets and liabilities  primarily related to net operating loss carry forwards in the foreign jurisdictions that the company believes will not be utilized during the carryforward periods 
during fiscal  the company recorded  of valuation reserves related to changes in the carrying value its investment in proditec  reversed  of valuation reserves upon reversal of its doubtful account allowance on its note receivable from the sale of its interest in the inspx joint venture  and reversed  of valuation reserves for capital loss carryforwards that were utilized to offset capital gains on its corporate income tax return 
during fiscal  the company recorded  of valuation reserves related to impairment charges on its investment in proditec and reversed  of valuation reserves upon partial reversal of its doubtful accounts allowance on its note receivable from the sale of its interest in the ins px joint venture 
during fiscal   of net valuation reserves for combined us and australian deferred taxes were eliminated due to the final dissolution of the related australian entity 
there were no other valuation allowances at september  due to anticipated utilization of all the deferred tax assets as the company believes it will have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
potential income tax exposures include potential challenges of various tax credits and deductions  and issues specific to state and local tax jurisdictions 
exposures are typically settled primarily through audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the compa ny to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
at september   the company had reserves of  for estimated tax exposures 
during fiscal and  there were no significant changes in these estimates 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because it relies on significant management judgment in making assumptions relative to temporary and permanent timing differences of tax effects  estimates of future earnings  prospective application of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  and the resulting ability to utilize tax assets at those future dates 
if the company s operating results were to fall short of expectations  thereby affecting the likelihood of realizing the deferr ed tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required to be included in the financial statements in any given period 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  increase tax expense and reduce net earnings 
in fiscal  the emergency economic stabilization act of was enacted 
as part of the legislation  the existing r d credit was retroactively renewed and extended to december  due to this change in tax law  the company recorded approximately  of additional r d tax credits in fiscal related to r d expenditures incurred during fiscal the r d tax credit was effective for the company for only the first fiscal quarter of prior to its enacted expiration date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has assessed its exposure to market risks for its financial instruments and has determined that its exposures to such risks are generally limited to those affected by the value of the us dollar compared to the euro and to a lesser extent the australian dollar  mexican peso  chinese renminbi and singapore dollar 
the terms of sales to european customers are typically denominated in euros 
the company expects that its standard terms of sale to international customers  other than those in europe  will continue to be denominated in us dollars  although as the company expands its operations in australia  latin america and china  transactions denominated in the local currencies of these countries may increase 
for sales transactions between international customers and the company s domestic operations  which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company assesses its currency exchange risk and may enter into forward contracts to minimize such risk 
at september   the company held a day forward contract for million million 
as of september   management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would affect net earnings before taxes by approximately  on an annual basis as a result of the conversion to us dollars of cash  accounts receivable  loans to foreign subsidiaries  and sales or other contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
these changes would positively affect net earnings if the us dollar weakens on world markets and negatively affect earnings if the us dollar strengthens on world markets 
as of september   the euro lost approximately in value against the us dollar compared to its value at september  during the twelve month period ended september   changes in the value of the euro against the us dollar ranged between a gain and a loss as compared to the value at september  most other foreign currencies showed similar changes in value against the us dollar during fiscal the effect of these fluctuations on the operations and financial results of the company were translation adjustments of  net of income tax  were recognized as a component of comprehensive income as a result of converting the euro denominated balance sheets of key technology bv and suplusco holding bv into bv dollars  and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar balance sheets of key technology australia pty ltd  the rmb balance sheet of key technology shanghai trading co  ltd  the singapore dollar balance sheet of key technology asia pacific pte

foreign exchange losses of  net of the effects of forward contracts settled during the year  were recognized in the other income and expense section of the consolidated statement of operations as a result of conversion of euro and other foreign currency denominated receivables  intercompany loans  and cash carried on the balance sheet of the us operations  as well as the result of the conversion of other non functional currency receivables  payables and cash carried on the balance sheets of the european  australian  chinese  singapore and mexican operations 
when the dollar strengthens on the world markets  the company s market and economic outlook for international sales could be negatively affected as export sales to international customers become relatively more expensive 
conversely  a relatively weaker us dollar makes the company s us manufactured goods less expensive to international customers when denominated in us dollars or potentially more profitable to the company when denominated in a foreign currency 
on the other hand  materials or components imported into the us may be more expensive 
a relatively weaker us dollar on the world markets  especially as measured against the euro  may favorably affect the company s market and economic outlook for international sales

s  but does import a significant portion of its products from its us based parent company

during the year ended september   interest rates applicable to these variable rate credit facilities ranged from to 
at september   the rate was on its domestic credit facility and on its european credit facility based on the lowest of the available alternative rates 
the company s mortgage bears interest at the bba libor plus basis points  but the company simultaneously entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the lender to fix the interest rate a 
as of september   management estimates that a basis point change in these interest rates would not affect net income before taxes because the company had no borrowings outstanding under its variable interest rate credit facilities and the interest rate swap effectively converts its variable rate mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage
