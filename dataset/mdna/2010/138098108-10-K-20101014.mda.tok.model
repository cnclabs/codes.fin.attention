overview cantel is a leading provider of infection prevention and control products and services in the healthcare market  specializing in the following operating segments water purification and filtration water purification equipment and services  filtration and separation products  and disinfectants for the medical  pharmaceutical  biotech  beverage and commercial industrial markets 
healthcare disposables single use  infection prevention and control products used principally in the dental market including face masks  sterilization pouches  towels and bibs  tray covers  saliva ejectors  germicidal wipes  plastic cups and disinfectants 
endoscope reprocessing medical device reprocessing systems  disinfectants  enzymatic detergents and other supplies used to high level disinfect flexible endoscopes 
dialysis medical device reprocessing systems  sterilants disinfectants  dialysate concentrates and other supplies for renal dialysis 
therapeutic filtration hollow fiber membrane filtration and separation technologies for medical applications 
included in all other reporting segment 
specialty packaging specialty packaging and thermal control products  as well as related compliance training  for the transport of infectious and biological specimens and thermally sensitive pharmaceutical  medical and other products 
included in all other reporting segment 
chemistries sterilants  disinfectants  detergents and decontamination services used in various applications for infection prevention and control 
included in all other reporting segment 
most of our equipment  consumables and supplies are used to help prevent the occurrence or spread of infections 
significant activity i net income increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal we continue to benefit from having a broad portfolio of infection prevention and control products sold into diverse business segments and we have proactively developed our overall business to where approximately of our net sales are attributable to consumable products and service 
the primary factors that contributed to this financial performance  as further described elsewhere in this md a  were as follows an increase in net income of approximately  due to an increase in demand during the first four months of fiscal  partially offset by a high level of demand during our fourth quarter of fiscal  for healthcare disposables products in both periods as a result of the outbreak of the novel hn swine flu in april  improved gross margins as a result of numerous profit improvement and sales and marketing initiatives and the continued shift in sales mix to higher margin disposables  higher selling prices including those attributable to converting the sale of high level disinfectants in our endoscope reprocessing segment from our former equipment distributor to our direct sales and service force at higher selling prices  reductions in manufacturing  raw material and distribution costs  general company wide efforts to control operating expenses while still investing in sales  marketing and research and development activities  and favorable interest costs due to both reduced average interest rates as well as lower outstanding borrowings 
the above favorable factors were partially offset by i decreases in net sales and profitability in our dialysis segment  ii increased selling costs in our endoscope reprocessing segment and iii decreases in net sales of capital equipment in our water purification and filtration segment  as further explained elsewhere in this md a 
additionally  although the outbreak of the novel hn flu resulted in strong sales volume of high margin face masks and other healthcare disposables products during the first four months of fiscal  such sales volume has returned to a sales level that is similar to that which existed prior to the outbreak of the novel hn flu given that the elevated level of reported cases of influenza viruses has subsided 
ii we sell our dialysis products to a concentrated number of customers 
sales in our dialysis segment were adversely impacted by the continued loss of some lower margin dialysate concentrate business from both domestic and international customers as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for such product  as well as the decrease in demand for our renatron reprocessing equipment  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
this reduction in dialysis sales has reduced overall profitability in this segment 
our market for dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers  which market has been decreasing in the united states despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single use dialyzers 
a further decrease in the market for dialysis reprocessing products is likely to result in continued loss of net sales and a lower level of operating income in this segment in the future 
see risk factors elsewhere in this form k 
iii while overall sales and operating income have increased in our water purification and filtration segment in fiscal compared with fiscal  our net sales of capital equipment used for dialysis as well as commercial and industrial applications have decreased primarily due to the slow growth of the overall economy and the deterioration in the credit markets in recent years  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
iv fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an overall adverse impact on our net income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
v we declared our first cash semiannual dividends of per share of outstanding common stock  which were paid on january  and july   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
vi we amended our credit facilities on may  primarily to extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from its august  expiration date to august   as well as to expand our acquisition financing capabilities  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
vii post fiscal acquisition we acquired the united states water purification business of gambro renal products inc gambro water or the gambro acquisition on october   as more fully described in business recent acquisition subsequent to july  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
viii fiscal acquisition we acquired the business of purity water company of san antonio  inc purity on june   as more fully described in business fiscal acquisition and note to the consolidated financial statements 
ix fiscal acquisition we acquired the business of gem water systems int l  llc gem on july   as more fully described in business fiscal acquisition and note to the consolidated financial statements 
x fiscal acquisitions we acquired the businesses of dialysis services  inc dsi on august   verimetrix  llc verimetrix on september   and strong dental products  inc strong dental on september   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
xi we created a new operating segment named chemistries  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
xii in july  we extended the life of certain out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers 
as a result  approximately  of additional stock based compensation expense was recorded in fiscal  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
xiii in june  we announced and began executing our plan to restructure our netherlands manufacturing operations as part of our continuing effort to reduce operating costs and leverage our existing united states infrastructure 
as a result of this restructuring  approximately  and  of restructuring costs were recorded in fiscals and  respectively  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share by in each of fiscals and  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
results of operations the results of operations described below reflect the operating results of cantel and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
since the dsi  verimetrix and strong dental acquisitions were completed on august   september  and september   respectively  their results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscals and and the portion of fiscal subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental had an overall insignificant effect on our results of operations for fiscals and and the portion of fiscal subsequent to their respective acquisition dates due to the small size of these businesses 
since the gem acquisition was completed on the last day of fiscal  its results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscal  but are not reflected in our results of operations for fiscals and the june  purity acquisition had an insignificant effect on our results of operations for fiscal due to both the small size of this business as well as its inclusion for only two months in fiscal  and its results of operations are excluded for all prior periods 
since the gambro acquisition was consummated after the end of fiscal  its results of operations are not included in our results of operations for any of the periods presented 
during fiscal  we changed our internal reporting processes to include a new operating segment called chemistries to reflect the way the company  through its executive management  manages  allocates resources and measures the performance of its businesses 
this new operating segment is the combination of a small portion of our existing sterilant business  comprised of products sold on an oem basis and previously recorded in our water purification and filtration segment  and a new business operation that was created to capitalize on our chemistry expertise and expand our product offerings in existing and new markets within the infection prevention and control arena 
this new chemistries operating segment has been combined for reporting purposes with our therapeutic filtration and specialty packaging operating segments into the all other reporting segment 
all periods presented have been restated to reflect this change 
the following table gives information as to the net sales from operations and the percentage to the total net sales from operations for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands water purification and filtration healthcare disposables endoscope reprocessing dialysis all other fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services  water purification and filtration products and services and healthcare disposables products  partially offset by a decrease in dialysis products 
net sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to increases in both domestic and international demand for i our endoscope reprocessing equipment as a result of a more aggressive sales commission plan designed to gain market share and expand into new markets and ii our disinfectants  equipment accessories and service due to the increased field population of equipment 
additionally  the increase was due to higher selling prices of our disinfectants in the united states as a result of converting such prior period sales from our former equipment distributor to our direct sales and service force 
net sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i approximately  of net sales due to the acquisition of gem on july  and purity on june   ii an increase in demand for our sterilants and filters within our installed equipment base of business  and iii the translation of canadian dollar net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar  which favorably impacted net sales by approximately  partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in demand for our water purification equipment used for dialysis including a decrease in demand for capital equipment by our largest customer as well as commercial and industrial applications primarily due to the slow growth of the overall economy and the deterioration in the credit markets in recent years  which may continue to adversely affect capital equipment sales 
increases in selling prices of our water purification and filtration products and services did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal despite nominal growth in the overall dental market primarily due to i increased sales volume of high margin face masks  disinfectants and other healthcare disposables products during the first four months of fiscal  partially offset by a high level of demand during the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to the outbreak of the novel hn flu swine flu in april  ii increased demand for our sterilization pouch and barrier cover products as a result of favorable sales and marketing initiatives and iii approximately  in higher net sales as a result of increases in selling prices that were implemented to offset corresponding supplier cost increases 
although the outbreak of the novel hn flu resulted in strong sales volume of high margin face masks and other healthcare disposables products during the first four months of fiscal  such sales volume has returned to a sales level that is similar to that which existed prior to the outbreak of the novel hn flu given that the elevated level of reported cases of influenza viruses has subsided 
atypical demand for face masks is highly dependent upon the severity and timing of any pandemic flu outbreak such as the recent novel hn flu  the ability of our company to educate existing customers and potential new customers on the benefits of our face masks  disinfectants and other products and the level of urgency our customers and the general public develop and maintain with respect to epidemic and pandemic preparedness 
net sales of dialysis products and services decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the continuing adverse impact of losing some dialysate concentrate business a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment from domestic and international customers as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for this lower margin commodity product  as well as various global economic factors with respect to international demand  and ii a decrease in demand in the united states including a decrease from our largest dialysis customer and internationally for our renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment 
due to sales price decreases by some of our competitors  we expect a continued decrease in net sales of our lower margin dialysate concentrate product in the future as we elect not to pursue unprofitable concentrate sales 
furthermore  fresenius medical care fresenius  the largest dialysis provider chain in the united states  manufactures dialysate concentrate themselves and has been decreasing their purchases of that product from us and may continue to do so in the future 
our market for dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers  which market has been decreasing in the united states despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single use dialyzers 
a further decrease in the market for dialysis reprocessing products is likely to result in continued loss of net sales and a lower level of operating income in this segment in the future 
increases in selling prices of our dialysis products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales in the all other reporting segment increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a  or  increase in net sales in our chemistries operating segment primarily as a result of increased domestic and international demand of our sterilants sold on an oem basis 
increases in selling prices of our therapeutic filtration  specialty packaging and chemistries products did not have a significant effect on net sales in the all other segment in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal increased compared with fiscal primarily due to i favorable sales mix due to the increased sales volume of certain higher margin products such as sterilants and filters in our water purification and filtration segment  sterilization pouches  barrier covers  face masks and disinfectants in our healthcare disposables segment and disinfectants and equipment accessories in our endoscope reprocessing segment  as well as decreased sales of our lower margin dialysate concentrate product in our dialysis segment  ii higher selling prices including those attributable to converting the sale of high level disinfectants in our endoscope reprocessing segment from our former equipment distributor to our direct sales and service force at higher selling prices  iii a decrease in raw material costs due to the lower price of oil and iv improved efficiencies in our manufacturing  distribution and service functions 
however  we cannot provide assurances that our gross profit percentage will not be adversely affected in the future i by price competition in certain of our segments such as dialysis and healthcare disposables  ii by uncertainties associated with our product mix and iii if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement price increases 
additionally  despite expensive shipping costs  some of our competitors manufacture certain healthcare disposable products in china and southeast asia due to lower overall costs in certain parts of that region of the world 
although we believe the quality of our healthcare disposable products  which are generally produced in the united states  are superior to similar products produced in china and southeast asia  we expect to experience significant pricing pressure that will adversely affect our gross profit in fiscal in our healthcare disposables segment as a result of low cost competition in china and southeast asia 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to i additional sales personnel and higher compensation expense principally in our endoscope reprocessing segment relating to incentive compensation  including commissions expense from a more aggressive commission plan designed to gain market share and expand into new markets  ii an increase in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to our healthcare disposables segment and iii increased sales support services principally in our water purification and filtration and endoscope reprocessing segments during the first six months of fiscal selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscals and  respectively 
the increase in our selling expense as a percentage of net sales was due to our strategic decision to invest in selling initiatives designed to gain or maintain market share as well as to expand into new markets 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to i higher compensation expense of approximately  relating to annual salary increases and incentive compensation in all our locations and additional personnel principally in our water purification and filtration segment and ii an increase of approximately  relating to foreign currency primarily as a result of the inclusion of foreign exchange gains during the prior year associated with translating certain foreign denominated assets into functional currencies as well as the translation of general and administrative expenses of our international subsidiaries using a significantly stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
these increases were substantially offset by i approximately  in lower bad debt expense primarily in our water purification and filtration segment  ii a  decrease in stock based compensation expense due to a  charge in july to extend the life of certain out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers and iii a decrease in overhead and restructuring costs at our netherlands operation due to the completion of restructuring activities  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to development work on certain new products in our newly created chemistries operating segment 
in fiscal  we intend to further invest in research and development to leverage our new chemistry group across various infection prevention and control opportunities 
interest interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to decreases in average outstanding borrowings and average interest rates as well as a  charge in the prior year relating to the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of an interest rate cap agreement  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in average interest rates 
income from operations before taxes income before income taxes increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the improved gross profit percentage on increased sales as well as lower interest expense  partially offset by higher selling expenses  as further explained above 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and in fiscals and  respectively 
the decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate was principally due to a lower level of cash repatriations from our foreign subsidiaries and the geographic mix of pre tax income  as described below 
the majority of our income before income taxes was generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
the decrease in our united states effective tax rate in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to less income taxes related to foreign repatriations 
in fiscal  we provided for income taxes on the repatriation of  in earnings from one of our canadian subsidiaries as compared with fiscal in which approximately  in earnings was repatriated from our subsidiaries in canada and the netherlands 
due to the uncertainty of our netherlands subsidiary utilizing tax benefits in the future  a tax benefit was not recorded on the losses from operations at our netherlands subsidiary in fiscal  thereby adversely affecting our overall consolidated effective tax rate in the prior year period 
in fiscal  our netherlands operation became slightly profitable as a result of the prior year restructuring of its operations  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
our canadian operations had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
approximately and of our income before income taxes was generated from our canadian operations in fiscals and  respectively 
overall statutory tax rates in canada are significantly below comparable rates in the united states 
additionally  the low overall effective tax rate in fiscal was attributable to the impact of a lower overall effective rate in our specialty packaging segment due to enacted rate deductions as applied to existing deferred income tax liabilities 
in fiscals and  approximately of our income before income taxes was generated from our operations in singapore  a country with a low corporate tax structure 
the overall effective tax rate for our singapore operation was and in fiscals and  respectively 
the results of operations for our subsidiary in japan did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate in fiscals and due to the size of income before income taxes generated from this operation 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authorities 
the majority of our unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions 
previously  any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions were recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
on august   we adopted accounting standards codification asc  business combinations asc  which requires the resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions to be recognized in our results of operations beginning with fiscal however  if our unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our overall effective tax rate due to the size of the unrecognized tax benefits in relation to our income before income taxes 
except for decreases due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation  we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on july  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july  our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax decrease in earnings per common share due to stock based compensation basic diluted the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the related income tax benefits which pertain only to stock awards and options that do not qualify as incentive stock options were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and a reduction to income tax expense 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications of existing awards and assumptions used in determining fair value  expected lives and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which historically was and is now approximately as we began paying dividends in fiscal  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
all of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  before income taxes  related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards which are expected to vest was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised or restricted stock becomes vested  the company is allowed a deduction on its income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as additional paid in capital or a reduction of deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
in fiscals and  such income tax deductions reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense including tax benefits on stock compensation expense that has only been reflected in past pro forma disclosures relating to fiscal years prior to august  which was determined based upon the award s fair value 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales were adversely impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales  primarily of our water purification and filtration operating segment  using a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
the increase in net sales in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of healthcare disposables products  endoscope reprocessing products and services  water purification and filtration products and services and therapeutic filtration products included in all other  partially offset by a decrease in dialysis products 
net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal despite negative growth in the overall dental market  primarily due to i increased sales volume of high margin face masks  disinfectants and other healthcare disposables products due to the outbreak of the novel hn flu swine flu in april  ii approximately  in higher net sales due to an increase in selling prices  which were implemented to offset corresponding supplier cost increases  iii the adverse impact on the first quarter of fiscal due to the consolidation of certain distributors of our dental products during resulting in the rationalization of duplicate inventories of the consolidated companies and iv approximately  in incremental net sales in the first quarter of fiscal due to the acquisition of strong dental during the first quarter of fiscal although the outbreak of the novel hn flu has resulted in strong sales volume during our fourth quarter of high margin face masks and other healthcare disposables products  we cannot provide assurances that such increased sales levels can be sustained throughout fiscal since such demand is highly dependent upon the severity and timing of the novel hn flu  the ability of our company to educate existing customers and potential new customers on the benefits of our face masks  disinfectants and other products and the level of urgency our customers and the general public develop and maintain with respect to epidemic and pandemic preparedness 
net sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the increase in demand in the united states for our disinfectants and product service due to the increased field population of equipment as well as our ability to gradually convert the sale of such items from our former equipment distributor who continued to purchase high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables from us and provide product service to our customers to our direct sales and service force at higher selling prices  ii higher selling prices  most of which relates to the direct sale of disinfectants  consumables and product service  which resulted in approximately  in incremental net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal  and iii approximately  in incremental net sales in the first quarter of our fiscal due to the acquisition of verimetrix during the first quarter of fiscal partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment in fiscal as a result of delayed spending on such investments due to the recent deterioration in the general economy and credit markets  which may continue to adversely affect future equipment sales 
net sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to i an increase in demand during fiscal for our sterilants and filters by pharmaceutical companies and within our installed equipment base of business  including one of our largest customers who standardized on our consumable products in their ordering system utilized by their dialysis clinics and ii higher selling prices  which offset increased manufacturing costs and favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  partially offsetting these increases were delayed investments during fiscal by customers of our water purification equipment used for dialysis as well as for commercial and industrial large capital applications as a result of the deterioration in the general economy and credit markets  which may continue to adversely affect capital equipment sales  and an  decrease in sales due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales using a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  an increase of  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to increases in both international and domestic demand for our hemoconcentrator products filtration devices used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery and hemofilter products filtration devices that perform a slow  continuous blood filtration therapy used to control fluid overload and acute renal failure in unstable  critically ill patients who cannot tolerate the rapid filtration rates of conventional hemodialysis 
increases in selling prices of our therapeutic filtration products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales of dialysis products and services decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to i the continuing adverse impact of previously losing some dialysate concentrate business a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment from domestic customers as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for this low margin commodity product  and ii a decrease in net sales of low margin dialysis reuse supplies 
due to sales price decreases by some of our competitors  we expect a continued decrease in net sales of our low margin dialysate concentrate product in fiscal as we elect not to pursue unprofitable concentrate sales 
furthermore  fresenius medical care fresenius  the largest dialysis provider chain in the united states  manufactures dialysate concentrate themselves and has been gradually decreasing their purchases of that product from us and may continue to do so in fiscal additionally  we cannot provide assurances that the level of concentrate sales to international customers will be sustained 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher selling prices  which favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  to partially offset higher manufacturing and shipping costs  including freight invoiced to customers related costs of a similar amount are included within cost of sales 
net sales contributed by the specialty packaging operating segment were  in fiscal  a decrease of compared with fiscal this decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased customer demand in the united states for our specialty packaging products due to changes in regulatory requirements  increased competition and a decrease in clinical trials by our customers primarily due to the deterioration in the general economy 
increases in selling prices of our specialty packaging products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal increased compared with fiscal primarily due to i favorable sales mix due to the increased sales volume of certain high margin products such as disinfectants and consumables in our endoscope reprocessing segment  face masks and sterilization accessories in our healthcare disposables segment  and sterilants and filters in our water purification and filtration segment  as well as decreased sales of our low margin dialysate concentrate product in our dialysis segment  ii higher selling prices including those attributable to our ability to gradually convert the sale of high level disinfectants  cleaners  and consumables in our endoscope reprocessing segment from our former equipment distributor to our direct sales and service force at higher selling prices  iii a decrease in raw material and distribution costs in all our segments due to the lower price of fuel and oil  iv improved efficiencies in our manufacturing  distribution and service functions and v inefficiencies in our water purification and filtration segment during the three months ended october  as a result of the integration of the acquired ge water process technologies water dialysis business into our facilities 
however  we cannot provide assurances that this gross profit percentage can be sustained  especially if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement price increases or we experience a significant change in sales mix away from higher margin products 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily due to i higher compensation expense relating to annual salary increases and incentive compensation in all of our reporting segments and additional sales personnel primarily in our water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables segments and ii an increase of approximately  in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to our healthcare disposables segment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  as a result of translating selling expenses of our international subsidiaries using a weaker canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal general and administrative expenses were  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased principally due to i the prior year inclusion of approximately  in separation benefits and other costs related to the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer on april   ii a decrease in overhead at our netherlands operation due to the completion of restructuring activities  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  iii a decrease of approximately  as a result of foreign exchange gains associated with translating certain foreign denominated assets into functional currencies and the translation of general and administrative expenses of our international subsidiaries using a significantly weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar  and iv a decrease of  in amortization expense of intangible assets 
these decreases were offset by an increase in compensation expense primarily related to annual salary increases and incentive compensation in all of our locations and an increase of approximately  in stock based compensation expense including a  charge in july to extend the life of certain out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs were  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal  is primarily due to increased development work on certain new products as well as continuing engineering on existing products primarily in our water purification and filtration  endoscope reprocessing and therapeutic filtration segments 
interest interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to decreases in average outstanding borrowings and average interest rates  partially offset by a  charge relating to the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of an interest rate cap agreement  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in average interest rates 
income before taxes income before income taxes increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the improved gross profit percentage on increased sales as well as lower interest expense  as further explained above 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and in fiscals and  respectively 
the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was affected principally by the geographic mix of pre tax income  repatriation of cash from our foreign subsidiaries and the impact of various tax rate changes  as described below 
the majority of our income before income taxes was generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
the increase in our united states effective tax rate in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was due to an increase in our federal tax rate to and additional taxes relating to the repatriation of approximately  in earnings from our subsidiaries in canada and the netherlands  partially offset by recently enacted federal tax legislation that enabled us to claim the research and experimentation tax credit as well as new york state tax rate reductions enacted in  which primarily relate to our healthcare disposables segment 
such new york state tax rate reductions had a significant favorable effect on our fiscal effective tax rate in the year of enactment 
approximately of our fiscal income before income taxes was generated from our canadian operations  which had an overall effective tax rate in fiscals and of and  respectively 
overall statutory tax rates in canada are significantly below comparable rates in the united states 
additionally  the low overall effective tax rate in fiscal was attributable to the impact of a lower overall effective rate in our specialty packaging segment due to recently enacted rate reductions as applied to existing deferred income tax liabilities 
due to the uncertainty of our netherlands subsidiary utilizing tax benefits in the future  a tax benefit was not recorded on the losses from operations at our netherlands subsidiary in fiscals and  thereby adversely affecting our overall consolidated effective tax rate 
the overall loss from our netherlands operation in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal as a result of the restructuring of its operations  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations for our subsidiaries in japan and singapore did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate in fiscals and due to the size of these operations relative to our united states  canada and netherlands operations 
however  during fiscal  we decided to place a full valuation allowance against the nols of our japanese subsidiary  which resulted in the recording of tax expense on the past losses of our subsidiary in japan 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the majority of our unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions 
accordingly  any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions have been recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
on august   we adopted asc  which requires the resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions to be recognized in our results of operations beginning with fiscal however  if our unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our effective tax rate due to the size of the unrecognized tax benefits in relation to our income before income taxes 
we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on august  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july  our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share by  and in fiscals  and  respectively and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the related income tax benefits which pertain only to stock awards and options that do not qualify as incentive stock options were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities or a reduction to income taxes payable  depending on the timing of the deduction  and a reduction to income tax expense 
on july   we extended the life of  fully vested out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers seven individuals in total under our employee stock option plan 
such options were scheduled to expire within six months after july  and had exercise prices ranging from to  which were greater than the closing price of on july   the date the compensation committee of our board of directors authorized the modification 
the sole modification was to extend the options expiration dates to january  all other terms and conditions of the stock options remain the same 
as a result of this modification  approximately  in additional stock based compensation expense was recorded in our consolidated financial statements on july   which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share by 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  assumptions used in determining fair value  expected lives and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under asc may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
all of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of tax  related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards which are expected to vest was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised or restricted stock becomes vested  the company is allowed a deduction on its income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as additional paid in capital and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
in fiscals and  options exercised and the vesting of restricted stock resulted in income tax deductions that reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense including tax benefits on stock compensation expense that has only been reflected in past pro forma disclosures relating to fiscal years prior to august  which was determined based upon the award s fair value 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at july   our working capital was  compared with  at july  cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes and increases in accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrued expenses due to an increase in customer deposits relating to capital equipment sales in our water purification and filtration segment and income taxes payable due to timing of payments  partially offset by increases in inventories due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our healthcare disposables and endoscope reprocessing segments and accounts receivable due to strong july sales in our endoscope reprocessing segment 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes and a decrease in inventories due to strong july sales in our healthcare disposables and endoscope reprocessing segments as well as a decrease in the cost of certain raw materials  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to an increase in prepaid commissions relating to service contracts in our endoscope reprocessing segment  as well as the timing of certain insurance premium payments 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes  a decrease in accounts receivable due to improved collections and an increase in income taxes payable due to timing associated with payments  partially offset by increases in inventories due to planned increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our endoscope reprocessing and healthcare disposables segments and prepaid expenses due to the prepayment of certain operating expenses primarily relating to commissions 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for capital expenditures and the acquisition of purity 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisition of gem  a payment for an acquisition earnout to the former owners of crosstex and capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of our building in the netherlands 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental  a payment for an acquisition earnout to the former owners of crosstex and capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  and  in fiscals and  respectively  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to repayments under our credit facilities and the payment of dividends to our shareholders  partially offset by proceeds from the exercises of stock options 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to repayments under our credit facilities  partially offset by a borrowing under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercises of stock options 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility primarily related to the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental and proceeds from the exercises of stock options  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities 
dividends in december  we announced that we intend to pay  for the first time  semiannual cash dividends of per outstanding share  or per share annually  of the company s common stock 
the first cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which totaled  was paid on january  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  the second cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which totaled  was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on july  future declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of the company s board of directors 
restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our management approved and initiated plans to restructure our netherlands subsidiary by relocating all of our manufacturing operations from the netherlands to the united states 
this action is part of our continuing effort to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies by leveraging the existing infrastructure of our minntech operations in minnesota 
the elimination of manufacturing operations in the netherlands has led to the end of onsite material management  quality assurance  finance and accounting  human resources and some customer service functions 
however  we continue to maintain a strong marketing  sales  service and technical support presence based in the netherlands to serve customers throughout europe  the middle east and africa 
in fiscals and  we recorded  and  respectively  in restructuring costs  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately in both years 
in fiscal   was recorded in cost of sales and  was recorded in general and administrative expenses 
in fiscal   was recorded in cost of sales and  was recorded in general and administrative expenses 
the restructuring plan was completed by july  and we have not incurred any additional restructuring costs since that date 
the majority of the restructuring costs were included in our endoscope reprocessing segment 
since the above costs were recorded in our netherlands subsidiary  which had been experiencing losses from its operations  tax benefits on the above costs were not recorded 
as part of the restructuring plan  we sold our netherlands building and land on may  and entered into a lease for years with the new owner so we can continue to use the facility as our european sales and service headquarters as well as for warehouse and distribution activity 
the sale of the building and land resulted in a gain of  which is being amortized over the life of the lease and is recorded in deferred revenue and other long term liabilities 
the rent for the full year lease of  was paid from the sale proceeds and recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets 
long term contractual obligations as of july   aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long term components are as follows year ended july  amounts in thousands thereafter total maturities of the credit facilities expected interest payments under the credit facilities minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases minimum commitments under noncancelable capital leases deferred compensation and other employment agreements total contractual obligations as of july   annual required payments during the year ending july  represent the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility since the may  amendment to our revolving credit facility extended the expiration date from august  to august  in september  we repaid  under the revolving credit facility and  under our term loan facility reducing our total outstanding borrowings to  at the end of september 
in october  we borrowed  under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the purchase price of the gambro acquisition thereby increasing total outstanding borrowings to  the remaining purchase price of  is payable in six equal quarterly payments ending april the expected interest payments under the term and revolving credit facilities reflect interest rates of and  respectively  which were our interest rates on outstanding borrowings at july  credit facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of crosstex  we entered into amended and restated credit facilities dated as of august  the us credit facilities with a consortium of lenders to fund the cash consideration paid in the acquisition and costs associated with the acquisition  as well as to modify our existing united states credit facilities 
the us credit facilities  as amended  include i a six year million senior secured amortizing term loan facility expiring august  and ii a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on august  amounts we repay under the term loan facility may not be re borrowed 
on may   we amended the us credit facilities  which amendment included the extension of the termination date for the revolving credit facility to august  debt issuance costs relating to the us credit facilities were recorded in other assets and are being amortized over the life of the credit facilities 
such unamortized debt issuance costs amounted to approximately  at july  at september   borrowings under the us credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from to above the lender s base rate  or at rates ranging from to above the london interbank offered rate libor  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and as further adjusted under the terms of the us credit facilities ebitda 
at september   the lender s base rate was and the libor rates applicable to our outstanding borrowings ranged from to 
the margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings at september  were above the lender s base rate and above libor 
the majority of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at september  the us credit facilities also provide for fees on the unused portion of our facilities at rates ranging from to  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to ebitda  such rate was at september  the us credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants and are secured by i substantially all of our us based assets including assets of cantel  minntech  mar cor  crosstex and strong dental and ii our pledge of all of the outstanding shares of minntech  mar cor  crosstex and strong dental and of the outstanding shares of our foreign based subsidiaries 
additionally  we are not permitted to pay cash dividends on our common stock in excess of  without the consent of our united states lenders 
as of july   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the us credit facilities 
on july   we had  of outstanding borrowings under the us credit facilities  which consisted of  and  under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  respectively 
in september  we repaid  under the revolving credit facility and  under our term loan facility reducing our total outstanding borrowings to  at the end of september 
in october  we borrowed  under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the purchase price of the gambro acquisition 
the us credit facilities have a termination date of august  although we may repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings throughout fiscal  we do not presently anticipate paying off the revolving credit facility in full by its termination date 
we are in discussions with our bank syndicate regarding modifications to such facility and expect to formally modify the facility before the expiration date 
however  since any modification will not be completed until later in fiscal  we will be required to reclassify the entire outstanding balance of the revolver from long term to current in periods subsequent to july  operating leases minimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities  warehouses  office space and equipment 
rent expense related to operating leases for fiscal was recorded on a straight line basis and aggregated  compared with  and  for fiscals and  respectively 
deferred compensation included in other long term liabilities are deferred compensation arrangements for certain former minntech directors and officers 
employment agreements we have previously entered into various employment agreements with executives of the company  including our corporate executive officers and our subsidiary chief executive officers 
the majority of such contracts expired and were replaced effective january  with severance contracts that defined certain compensation arrangements relating to various employment termination scenarios 
convertible note receivable in february  we invested an initial  in a senior subordinated convertible promissory note issued by biosafe  inc biosafe  in connection with biosafe s grant to us of certain exclusive and non exclusive license rights to biosafe s antimicrobial additive 
biosafe is the owner of a patented and proprietary antimicrobial agent that is built into the manufacturing of end products to achieve long lasting microbial protection on such end products surface 
as a result of biosafe s successful raising of a minimum incremental amount of cash following our investment  we invested an additional  in notes of biosafe in january bringing the aggregate investment in biosafe notes to  as obligated under our agreement with biosafe 
we are not obligated to invest any additional funds 
the notes are convertible into a newly created series of preferred stock of biosafe 
interest is payable in shares of biosafe stock or in cash 
the notes accrue interest at a per annum rate of until the maturity date of june  or earlier exercise 
if not paid by the maturity date  interest will accrue thereafter at a rate of per annum 
in connection with our investment  we entered into a license agreement with biosafe under which we will pay biosafe a fixed royalty percentage of sales of our products containing biosafe s antimicrobial formulation 
this investment  together with the accrued interest  is included within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets at july  and the carrying value of this investment approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the notes and the relative consistent underlying value of biosafe 
financing needs although most of our operating segments generate significant cash from operations  our healthcare disposables  dialysis  water purification and filtration and endoscope reprocessing segments are the largest generators of cash 
at july   we had a cash balance of  of which  was held by foreign subsidiaries 
on september   we repatriated  in earnings from one of the foreign subsidiaries thereby reducing their cash balance 
we believe that our current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations and the funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations  particularly given that we historically have not needed to borrow for working capital purposes 
at october    was available under our united states revolving credit facility  which expires on august  under the terms of our credit facilities we are limited to the amount of aggregate purchase price we pay for acquisitions during the duration of the credit agreement without obtaining prior bank approval 
as a result of the may  amendment to our us credit facilities  the aggregate purchase price permitted for future acquisitions without obtaining prior bank approval was reset to  of which  and  was used for the acquisitions of purity and gambro water  respectively 
foreign currency in fiscal  compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
additionally  at july  compared with july   the value of the canadian dollar relative to the value of the united states dollar increased by approximately 
the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
additionally  changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affected our results of operations because a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
in fiscal  compared with fiscal the average value of the euro increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
additionally  at july  compared with july   the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar decreased by approximately 
the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the united states dollar 
additionally  changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
furthermore  as part of the restructuring of our netherlands subsidiary  as described in note to the consolidated financials and elsewhere in this md a  certain cash bank accounts  accounts receivable and liabilities of our united states subsidiaries  minntech and mar cor  are now denominated and ultimately settled in euros or british pounds but must be converted into our functional united states currency 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of i the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  ii the euro relative to the united states dollar and iii the british pound relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies  we enter into short term contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros and british pounds forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there were three foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of  at september   which cover certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
such contracts expired on september  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our subsidiaries that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than their functional currencies 
under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros and british pounds may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging asc  such foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy canadian dollars  euros and british pounds forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
in fiscal  such forward contracts partially offset the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar in fiscal  compared with fiscal  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of our balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our net income of approximately  primarily due to the increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet at july  compared with july   the total of the foreign currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of  in fiscal  but was reduced to an overall loss of  due to a tax adjustment relating to foreign repatriations  thereby decreasing stockholders equity 
inflation in fiscal  inflation did not have a significant impact on our operations 
however  our businesses can be adversely impacted by rising fuel and oil prices and are heavily reliant on certain raw materials  such as chemicals  paper pulp  resin  stainless steel and plastic components 
from time to time  we experience price increases for raw materials 
if we are unable to implement price increases to our customers  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we continually evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to dialysis  therapeutic  specialty packaging  chemistries and endoscope reprocessing products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when our distribution fleet is utilized except for one large customer in dialysis whereby all products are shipped fob destination 
with respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  primarily with respect to some of our water purification and filtration equipment  endoscope reprocessing equipment and an insignificant amount of our sales of dialysis equipment  post delivery obligations such as installation  in servicing or training are contractually specified  in such instances  revenue recognition is deferred until all of such conditions have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
with respect to a portion of water purification and filtration product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered 
a portion of our water purification and filtration and endoscope reprocessing sales are recognized as multiple element arrangements  whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment  installation and service components based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and installation sold as stand alone components 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
with respect to certain service contracts in our endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration operating segments  service revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of our sales contain right of return provisions 
customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our sales of dialysis  healthcare disposable and water purification and filtration products and certain prepaid packaging products 
we do not offer price protection  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products 
with respect to certain of our dialysis  dental  water purification and filtration and endoscope reprocessing customers  volume rebates are provided  such volume rebates are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
the increase in volume rebates in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to increased sales volume primarily in our healthcare disposables and endoscope reprocessing segments 
the increase in volume rebates in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to new terms in a renewed rebate arrangement with a major dental distributor in our healthcare disposables segment 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate periods 
if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the volume rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of therapeutic filtration products and healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors  water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly and through third party distributors to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other end users  our endoscope reprocessing products and services are sold primarily to distributors internationally and directly to hospitals and other end users in the united states  specialty packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users  and chemistries products and services are sold to medical products and service companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables  reductions in allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  we use historical experience as well as current market information 
with few exceptions  the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of our identifiable intangible assets  including customer relationships  technology  brand names  non compete agreements and patents  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
our management is primarily responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
in performing a review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments by using average fair value results of the market multiple and discounted cash flow methodologies  as well as the comparable transaction methodology when applicable 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
in performing our annual review for indefinite lived intangibles  management compares the current fair value of such assets to their carrying values 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether expected future non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results and cash flows which management believes to be reasonable  discount rates based on the company s weighted average cost of capital and appropriate benchmark peer companies 
assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales forecasts 
subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment 
although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
at july   the average fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded book value by substantial amounts  except our specialty packaging segment  which had an average fair value that exceeded book value by approximately 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected non discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
with few exceptions  our historical assessments of our long lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized 
however  the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimates 
warranties we provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of our products have a one year warranty  although a majority of our endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states carries a warranty period of up to fifteen months 
we record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
stock based compensation for fiscal and earlier periods  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under which stock compensation expense was not recognized because we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
beginning august   we accounted for stock options under asc using the modified prospective method for the transition 
under the modified prospective method  stock compensation expense is recognized for any option grant or stock award granted on or after august   as well as the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to august   based upon the award s fair value 
most of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted stock are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications to existing awards and assumptions used in determining fair value  expected lives and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which historically has been and is now approximately as we began paying dividends in january  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to pending and threatened legal actions 
it is our policy to accrue for amounts related to these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount of anticipated exposure can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that any of these pending claims or legal actions will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets  as adjusted for valuation allowances  will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
a review of our deferred tax items considers known future changes in various effective tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the effective tax rate were to change in the future  particularly in the united states and to a lesser extent canada  our items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the majority of such unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions and are based primarily upon management s assessment of exposure associated with acquired companies 
previously  any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions were recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
on august   we adopted asc  which requires the resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions to be recognized in our results of operations beginning with fiscal unrecognized tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the related liability 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature 
we reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries  as well as reserves for accounts receivable  inventories and warranties 
the ultimate settlement of such liabilities may be for amounts which are different from the amounts recorded 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities we recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as costs to terminate a contract  the exit or disposal of a business  or the early termination of a leased property  by recognizing the liability at fair value when incurred  except for certain one time termination benefits  such as severance costs  for which the period of recognition begins when a severance plan is communicated to employees 
inherent in the calculation of liabilities relating to exit and disposal activities are significant management judgments and estimates  including estimates of termination costs  employee attrition and the interest rate used to discount certain expected net cash payments 
such judgments and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis 
the cumulative effect of a change to a liability resulting from a revision to either timing or the amount of estimated cash flows is recognized by us as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
although we have historically recorded minimal charges associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded charges associated with exit or disposal activities in fiscals and relating to our restructuring plan for our netherlands manufacturing operations  as further described in our md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other matters we do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements  other than future commitments under operating leases and employment and license agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and market risk a portion of our products in all of our business segments are exported to and imported from a variety of geographic locations  and our business could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting all of such geographies including but not limited to the united states  canada  the european union  the united kingdom and the far east 
a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
the businesses of our canadian subsidiaries could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar also affect our results of operations because certain net assets of our canadian subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into their functional currency 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar had an overall adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our net income and stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis and endoscope reprocessing segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
furthermore  as part of the restructuring of our netherlands subsidiary  as described in note to the consolidated financials and elsewhere in this md a  certain cash bank accounts  accounts receivable and liabilities of our united states subsidiaries  minntech and mar cor  are now denominated and ultimately settled in euros or british pounds but must be converted into our functional united states currency 
additionally  the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and the euro or british pound did not have a significant overall impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our net income and stockholders equity 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of i the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  ii the euro relative to the united states dollar and iii the british pound relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such net assets into functional currencies  we enter into short term contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros and british pounds forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there were three foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of  at july   which covered certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
such contracts expired on august  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our subsidiaries that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than their functional currencies 
under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase canadian dollars  euros and british pounds may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
in fiscal  such forward contracts partially offset the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
the functional currency of minntech s japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar in fiscal  compared with fiscal  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an adverse impact on our net income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to the increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  and a favorable impact upon stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
interest rate market risk we have a united states credit facility for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings are under libor contracts 
therefore  interest expense is affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states as well as libor interest rates 
additionally  we amended our us credit facilities on may  due to current market conditions  the modification of our credit facilities resulted in an increase of our margins above the lender s base rate and libor  which would adversely affect our results of operations in the future if levels of outstanding borrowings increase significantly 
market risk sensitive transactions we are exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  our outstanding debt is under our united states credit facilities  described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such credit facilities consist of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally under libor contracts ranging from one to twelve months 
therefore  our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
such outstanding debt under our united states credit facilities was  and  at july  and  respectively  and the average outstanding balance during fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively 
during fiscals and  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was and  respectively 
a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  and  during fiscals and  respectively 
however  substantially all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at july  that have expiration dates ranging from to months  therefore  we are substantially protected throughout most of fiscal from any exposure associated with increasing libor rates  assuming debt levels remain constant 
our other long term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates 
we also maintained a cash balance of  at july  which is either maintained in cash or invested in low risk and low return cash equivalents such as short term guaranteed investment certificates issued by various canadian banks and united states money market funds with leading banking institutions 
an increase in interest rates would generate additional interest income for us from these low risk cash equivalents  which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  we are principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar  euro and british pound as these currencies relate to the united states dollar 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary have net assets in currencies principally united states dollars other than their functional canadian and euro currency  which must be converted into its functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
similarly  our united states subsidiaries have net assets in currencies principally euros and british pounds other than their functional united states currency  which must be converted into its functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
therefore  our canadian subsidiaries  netherlands subsidiary and united states subsidiaries are exposed to risk if the value of the canadian dollar  euro and british pound appreciates relative to the united states dollar 
for fiscals and  a uniform increase in the canadian dollar  euro and british pound relative to the united states dollar would have resulted in aggregate realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively 
however  since certain of our subsidiaries use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the impact of fluctuations of the canadian dollar  euro and british pound relative to the united states dollar  realized losses relating to the fluctuation of those currencies would be partially offset by gains on the foreign currency forward contracts 
in addition to the above  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our financial statements 
for fiscals and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  due to the translation of the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries adverse changes would be caused by appreciation of either the canadian dollar or the euro relative to the united states dollar 
however  such a change in foreign currency rates would have resulted in an unrealized gain on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries of  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
such an unrealized gain would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our stockholders equity 
conversely  if the canadian dollar and the euro depreciated by relative to the united states dollar  we would have recognized realized gains after tax of approximately  and  in fiscals and  respectively  and unrealized losses of  and  in fiscals and  respectively  on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since we view these investments as long term  we would not expect such unrealized losses to be realized in the near term 
the aggregate adverse impact  net of tax  to our results of operations of a uniform increase in foreign currency exchange rates  as described above  due to both financial statement translation and functional currency conversion would have been  and  for fiscals and  respectively  partially offset by the affect of our foreign currency forward contracts
