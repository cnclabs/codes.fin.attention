bank holding companies are required to comply with the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ have adopted risk based capital ratio guidelines to which depository institutions under their respective supervision are subject 
the guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
old national s banking affiliate  old national bank  met all risk based capital requirements of the fdic and occ as of december  for old national s regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of december   see note to the consolidated financial statements

bank holding companies may now acquire banks anywhere in the united states subject to certain state restrictions 
the gramm leach bliley act glba permits bank holding companies which have elected to become financial holding companies to engage in a substantially broader range of non banking activities  including securities  investment advice and insurance activities  than is permissible for bank holding companies that have not elected to become financial holding companies 
old national has elected to be a financial holding company 
as a result  old national may underwrite and sell securities and insurance 
it may acquire  or be acquired by  brokerage firms and insurance underwriters 
glba established new requirements for financial institutions to provide enhanced privacy protections to customers 
in june of  the federal banking agencies jointly adopted a final regulation providing for the implementation of these protections 
financial institutions are required to provide notice to consumers which details its privacy policies and practices  describes under what conditions a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties and provides an opt out method which enables consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing customer information to nonaffiliated third parties 
financial institutions were required to be in compliance with the final regulation by july   and old national was in compliance at such date and continues to be in compliance 
in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted 
the eesa authorizes the treasury department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program tarp 
the purpose of tarp is to restore confidence and stability to the us banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
the treasury department has allocated billion towards the tarp capital purchase program cpp

on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients  including old national  until the institution has repaid the treasury  which is now permitted under arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
old national has been a tarp recipient  but has exercised its right to repay treasury and is no longer subject to the compensation and corporate expenditure limits imposed by arra on tarp recipients 
for details regarding old national s participation in tarp  refer to the financial condition capital section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the matters discussed above  old national bank is subject to additional regulation of its activities  including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting its lending  deposit and collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities 
the earnings of financial institutions are also affected by general economic conditions and prevailing interest rates  both domestic and foreign and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its various agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
additional legislative and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered by congress  state legislatures and various regulatory agencies  including those referred to above 
it cannot be predicted with certainty whether such legislative or administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry in general or old national and old national bank in particular would be affected

table of contents item a 
risk factors old national s business could be harmed by any of the risks noted below 
in analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in old national  investors should consider  among other factors  the following risks related to old national s business the current banking crisis  including the enactment of eesa and arra  may significantly affect our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or stock price 
the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers seemingly without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
eesa  which established tarp  was signed into law in october as part of tarp  the treasury established the cpp to provide up to billion of funding to eligible financial institutions through the purchase of capital stock and other financial instruments for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
then  on february   president obama signed arra  as a sweeping economic recovery package intended to stimulate the economy and provide for broad infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
there can be no assurance as to the actual impact that eesa or its programs  including the cpp  and arra or its programs  will have on the national economy or financial markets 
the failure of these significant legislative measures to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common shares 
there have been numerous actions undertaken in connection with or following eesa and arra by the federal reserve board  congress  the treasury  the fdic  the sec and others in efforts to address the current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry that followed the sub prime mortgage market meltdown which began in these measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
the purpose of these legislative and regulatory actions is to help stabilize the us banking system 
eesa  arra and the other regulatory initiatives described above may not have their desired effects 
if the volatility in the markets continues and economic conditions fail to improve or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if old national s actual loan losses exceed old national s allowance for loan losses  old national s net income will decrease 
old national makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of old national s loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of old national s borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of old national s loans 
despite old national s underwriting and monitoring practices  the effect of the declining economy could negatively impact the ability of old national s borrowers to repay loans in a timely manner and could also negatively impact collateral values 
as a result  old national may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on old national s operating results 
since old national must use assumptions regarding individual loans and the economy  old national s current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses 
old national s assumptions may not anticipate the severity or duration of the current credit cycle and old national may need to significantly increase old national s provision for losses on loans if one or more of old national s larger loans or credit relationships becomes delinquent or if old national expands its commercial real estate and commercial lending 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review old national s allowance for loan losses and may require old national to increase the provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge offs 
material additions to old national s allowance would materially decrease old national s net income 
there can be no assurance that old national s monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that old national s allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses 
old national s loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
old national bank originates commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  agricultural real estate loans  agricultural loans  consumer loans  and residential real estate loans primarily within old national s market areas 

table of contents commercial real estate  commercial  consumer  and agricultural loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
these loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons commercial real estate loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
commercial loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
agricultural loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either old national bank or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates 
credit quality issues may continue to broaden in these sectors during depending on the severity and duration of the declining economy and current credit cycle 
if old national forecloses on collateral property  old national may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property  resulting in reduced revenues 
old national may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect old national s investment and may thereafter own and operate such property  in which case old national will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate 
the amount that old national  as a mortgagee  may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of old national s control  including  but not limited to i general or local economic conditions  ii neighborhood values  iii interest rates  iv real estate tax rates  v operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  vi environmental remediation liabilities  vii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  viii zoning laws  ix governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  and x acts of god 
certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate  principally real estate taxes  insurance  and maintenance costs  may adversely affect the income from the real estate 
therefore  the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property  and old national may have to advance funds in order to protect old national s investment  or old national may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss 
the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect old national s ability to generate revenues  resulting in reduced levels of profitability 
we face risks with respect to future expansion 
we may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future  and we may engage in de novo branch expansion 
we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
acquisitions and mergers involve a number of expenses and risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying potential new markets  as well as acquisition and merger targets  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  
table of contents the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses  entry into new markets where we lack experience  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek 
there can be no assurance integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders 
there is no assurance that  following any future mergers or acquisitions  our integration efforts will be successful or that  after giving effect to the acquisition  we will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 
economic conditions have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits 
in response to economic and market conditions  from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate 
these initiatives  as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions  may not be sufficient to meet current and future changes in economic and market conditions and allow us to achieve profitability 
in addition  costs actually incurred in connection with our restructuring actions may be higher than our estimates of such costs and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 
unless and until the economy  loan demand  credit quality and consumer confidence improve  it is unlikely that revenues will increase significantly  and may be reduced further 
old national operates in an extremely competitive market  and old national s business will suffer if old national is unable to compete effectively 
in old national s market area  the company encounters significant competition from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries 
the company s competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than old national does and may offer services that old national does not or cannot provide 
old national s profitability depends upon old national s continued ability to compete successfully in old national s market area 
the loss of key members of old national s senior management team could adversely affect old national s business 
old national believes that old national s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of old national s senior management 
their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit old national 
the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense  and the loss of any of old national s key personnel or an inability to continue to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect old national s business 
a breach of information security or compliance breach by one of our agents or vendors could negatively affect old national s reputation and business 
old national relies upon a variety of computing platforms and networks over the internet for the purposes of data processing  communication and information exchange 
despite the safeguards instituted by old national  such systems are susceptible to a breach of security 
in addition  old national relies on the services of a variety of third party vendors to meet old national s data processing and communication needs 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of old national s information systems or our vendors information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial loss 
such costs and or losses could materially affect old national s earnings 

table of contents fiduciary activity risk factor old national is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to old national s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities 
if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to old national they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of old national and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the old national s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the old national s financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the banking industry changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect old national s earnings  as old national s borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing old national s loans decline 
old national s success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic or political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as the on going recession  unemployment  changes in interest rates  inflation  money supply and other factors beyond old national s control may adversely affect its asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  the old national s earnings 
because old national has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of old national s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
in addition  substantially all of old national s loans are to individuals and businesses in old national s market area 
consequently  any economic decline in old national s primary market areas which include indiana  kentucky and illinois could have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
markets are currently volatile the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers seemingly without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
the current market volatility could contribute to a further decline in the market value of certain security investments and other assets of old national and if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on results of operations  capital or financial position 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect old national s results of operations and financial condition 
old national s earnings depend substantially on old national s interest rate spread  which is the difference between i the rates old national earns on loans  securities and other earning assets and ii the interest rates old national pays on deposits and other borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond old national s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
if market interest rates rise  old national will have competitive pressures to increase the rates old national pays on deposits  which could result in a decrease of old national s net interest income 
if market interest rates decline  old national could experience fixed rate loan prepayments and higher investment portfolio cash flows  resulting in a lower yield on earnings assets 

table of contents old national operates in a highly regulated environment  and changes in laws and regulations to which old national is subject may adversely affect old national s results of operations 
old national operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of comptroller of the currency occ  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve and the state of indiana 
in addition  the treasury has certain supervisory and oversight duties and responsibilities under eesa and the cpp 
see business supervision and regulation herein 
applicable laws and regulations may change  and such changes may adversely affect old national s business 
such regulation and supervision of the activities in which an institution may engage is primarily intended for the protection of the depositors and federal deposit insurance funds 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of restrictions on activities  regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  including but not limited to changes in the regulations governing institutions  could have a material impact on old national and its operations 
our internal operations are subject to a number of risks 
old national s internal operations are subject to certain risks  including but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
the banking industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace 
to keep up with its competition  old national needs to stay abreast of innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable it to compete on a cost effective basis 
the cost of such technology  including personnel  can be high in both absolute and relative terms 
there can be no assurance  given the fast pace of change and innovation  that old national s technology  either purchased or developed internally  will meet or continue to meet the needs of old national 
our earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failures that are not within our direct control 
financial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk 
a fraud can be perpetrated by a customer of the bank  an employee  a vendor  or members of the general public 
we are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans  ach transactions  atm transactions and checking transactions 
our largest fraud risk  associated with the origination of loans  includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties 
compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our standards 
there can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by the third parties that we deal with 
repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact the performance of our loan portfolio 
risks related to old national s stock we may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice 
old national has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common stockholders 
the payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions 
any payment of dividends in the future will depend  in large part  on old national s earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and other factors considered relevant by old national s board of directors 

table of contents the price of old national s common stock may be volatile  which may result in losses for investors 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of old national s common stock 
in addition  the following factors may cause the market price for shares of old national s common stock to fluctuate announcements of developments related to old national s business  fluctuations in old national s results of operations  sales or purchases of substantial amounts of old national s securities in the marketplace  general conditions in old national s banking niche or the worldwide economy  a shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  and old national s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects 
old national s charter documents and federal regulations may inhibit a takeover  prevent a transaction that may favor or otherwise limit old national s growth opportunities  which could cause the market price of old national s common stock to decline 
certain provisions of old national s charter documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of old national 
in addition  old national must obtain approval from regulatory authorities before acquiring control of any other company

this building  which houses old national s general corporate functions  is leased from an unaffiliated third party 
the lease term expires december   and provides for the tenant s option to extend the term of the lease for four five year periods 
in addition  during  and  eighty six financial centers were sold in a series of sale leaseback transactions to unaffiliated third parties 
these properties are leased back from the landlord with lease terms ranging from ten to twenty four years

as of december   old national and its affiliates operated a total of banking centers  loan production or other financial services offices  primarily in the states of indiana  illinois and kentucky 
of these facilities  were owned and were leased from unaffiliated third parties 
item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  old national and its subsidiaries have been named  from time to time  as defendants in various legal actions 
certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
old national contests liability and or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter 
in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters  particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages  old national cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss  if any  related to such matters  how or if such matters will be resolved  when they will ultimately be resolved  or what the eventual settlement  or other relief  if any  might be 
subject to the foregoing  old national believes  based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel  that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of old national  although the outcome of such matters could be material to old national s operating results and cash flows for a particular future period  depending on  among other things  the level of old national s revenues or income for such period 

table of contents in november  several beneficiaries of certain trusts filed a complaint against old national and old national trust company in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky relating to the administration of the trusts in the complaint  as amended  alleged that old national through a predecessor  as trustee  mismanaged termination of a lease between the trusts and a tenant mining company 
the complaint seeks  among other relief  unspecified damages  costs and expenses  including attorneys fees  and such other relief as the court might find just and proper 
on march   the court granted summary judgment to old national concluding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue old national in this matter

net interest income and net interest margin in the following discussion are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which adjusts tax exempt interest income to an amount that would be comparable to interest subject to income taxes 
net income is unaffected by these taxable equivalent adjustments as an offsetting increase of the same amount is made in the income tax section 
net interest income included taxable equivalent adjustments of million for and million for net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors  primarily the volume and mix of earning assets  funding sources and interest rate fluctuations 
other factors include prepayment risk on mortgage and investment related assets and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities 
in the current market  wholesale funding sources cost less than certain client deposits  however  ordinarily funding from client deposits costs less than wholesale funding sources 
factors  such as general economic activity  federal reserve board monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments  can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding and the net interest income and margin 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million in  a decrease from the million reported in the net interest margin was for  a basis point decrease compared to the reported in the decrease in both net interest income and net interest margin is primarily due to the decrease in earning asset yield being greater than the decrease in the cost of funding  combined with a change in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points  the decrease was more than offset by the basis decrease in the yield on average assets

risk management overview management  with the oversight of the board of directors  has in place company wide structures  processes  and controls for managing and mitigating risk 
the following discussion addresses the three major risks we face credit  market  and liquidity 
credit risk credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligor s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms 
our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities 
investment activities within our securities portfolio  the non agency collateralized mortgage obligations represent the greatest exposure to the current instability in the residential real estate and credit markets 
at december   we had non agency collateralized mortgage obligations with a market value of million  or approximately of the available for sale securities portfolio 
the unrealized loss on these securities at december   was approximately million 
we expect conditions in the overall residential real estate and credit markets to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future 
deterioration in the performance of the underlying loan collateral could result in deterioration in the performance of our asset backed securities 
ten of these securities were rated below investment grade as of december  and during we experienced million of other than temporary impairment  of which million was recorded as a credit loss in earnings and million is included in other comprehensive income 
we also carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities  which are collateralized debt obligations  due to illiquidity in that market and performance of underlying collateral 
at december   we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of approximately million  or of the available for sale securities portfolio 
during  we experienced million of other than temporary impairment  of which million was recorded as a credit loss in earnings for six of these securities and million is included in other comprehensive income 
these securities remained classified as available for sale and at december   the unrealized loss on our pooled trust preferred securities was approximately million 
the majority of the remaining mortgage backed securities are backed by us government sponsored or federal agencies 
municipal bonds  corporate bonds and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the credit worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
we do not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that we will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery 

table of contents counterparty exposure counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation in a financial transaction 
we define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased  repurchase agreements  correspondent bank relationships  and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry 
old national s net counterparty exposure was an asset of million at december  lending activities community based lending personnel  along with region based independent underwriting and analytic support staff  extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our risk and credit policy committee 
this committee  which meets quarterly  is made up of outside directors 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  credit exposures  peer comparisons  problem loans and charge offs 
in addition  the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment 
we lend primarily to small and medium sized commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing  agribusiness  transportation  mining  wholesaling and retailing 
at december   we had no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of our portfolio and had no exposure to foreign borrowers or lesser developed countries 
our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve  primarily indiana  illinois and kentucky 
we continue to be affected by weakness in the economy of our principal markets 
management expects that trends in under performing  criticized and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens or weakens

under performing assets totaled million at december  and million at december  as a percent of total loans and foreclosed properties  under performing assets at december were for and for the nonaccrual category of under performing loans was million at december   compared to million at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses to under performing assets ratio stood at compared to at december  from time to time  old national may agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower s loan 
in cases where such modifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty  the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are placed on nonaccrual status until the company determines the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms of six months 
at december   loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring  which are included in nonaccrual loans  totaled million 
there were no loans modified in troubled debt restructurings at december  management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of under performing loans and will consider the possibility of sales of troubled and non performing loans  which could result in additional charge offs to the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents classified loans  including nonaccrual  renegotiated  past due days and other problem loans  were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  of this total  other problem loans  which are loans reviewed for the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  other classified assets include million of investment securities that fell below investment grade rating at december  criticized loans  or special mention loans  were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  management believes it has taken a prudent approach to the evaluation of under performing  criticized and classified loans  and the loan portfolio in general both in acknowledging the portfolio s general condition and in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
loan officers and credit underwriters jointly grade the larger commercial and commercial real estate loans in the portfolio periodically as determined by loan policy requirements or determined by specific guidelines based on loan characteristics as set by management and banking regulation 
periodically  these loan grades are reviewed independently by the loan review department 
for impaired loans  an assessment is conducted as to whether there is likely loss in the event of default 
if such a loss is determined to be likely  the loss is quantified and a specific reserve is assigned to the loan 
for the balance of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio  loan grade migration analysis coupled with historic loss experience within the respective grades is used to develop reserve requirement ranges 
these reserve requirement ranges are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of reserves for consumer and residential real estate loans

interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the re pricing of assets and liabilities  changes in the slope of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
we manage interest rate risk within an overall asset and liability management framework that includes attention to credit risk  liquidity risk and capitalization 
a principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
asset and liability management activity is governed by a policy reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors has delegated the administration of this policy to the funds management committee  a committee of the board of directors  and the executive balance sheet management committee  a committee comprised of senior executive management 
the funds management committee meets quarterly and oversees adherence to policy and recommends policy changes to the board 
the executive balance sheet management committee meets at least quarterly 
this committee determines balance sheet management strategies and initiatives for the company 
a group comprised of corporate and line management meets monthly to implement strategies and initiatives determined by the executive balance sheet management committee 
we use two modeling techniques to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the company  net interest income at risk and economic value of equity 
net interest income at risk is used by management and the board of directors to evaluate the impact of changing rates over a two year horizon 
economic value of equity is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk 
these models simulate the likely behavior of our net interest income and the likely change in our economic value due to changes in interest rates under various possible interest rate scenarios 
because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income and value  we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results 
for this reason  we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes 

table of contents old national s board of directors  through its funds management committee  monitors our interest rate risk 
policy guidelines  in addition to december  and results are as follows net interest income month policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone to to to to to to red zone na na na na na na net interest income month cumulative policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone to to to to to to red zone na na na na na na economic value of equity policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down down up up up green zone yellow zone to to to to to to red zone na na na na na na red zone policy limits represent our normal absolute interest rate risk exposure compliance limit 
policy limits defined as green zone represent the range of potential interest rate risk exposures that the funds management committee believes to be normal and acceptable operating behavior 
yellow zone policy limits represent a range of interest rate risk exposures falling below the bank s maximum allowable exposure red zone but above its normally acceptable interest rate risk levels green zone 
policy limits are applicable to negative changes in net interest income at risk and economic value of equity 
modeling for the down basis points  down basis points  and down basis points scenarios for both the net interest income at risk and economic value of equity are not applicable in the current rate environment because the scenarios floor at zero before absorbing the full   and basis point drop  respectively 
at december   modeling indicated old national s net interest income at risk values were positive for up  up and up scenarios for both the month and month net interest income at risk 
positive results indicate that net interest income increases relative to net interest income modeled using interest rates as of december  
table of contents at december   modeling indicated that old national was with in the green zone policy limit for the up  up  and up economic value of equity scenarios  which is considered normal and acceptable for economic value of equity scenarios 
old national s economic value of equity eve scenarios indicated negative changes to economic value in rising interest rate scenarios at december  compared to positive changes to economic value in rising interest rate scenarios at december  these changes in eve modeling results were primarily driven by old national s increase in investments as a percent of interest earning assets and were partially offset by an increase in old national s deposit base from december  to december  also impacting eve at december  was the issuance of  shares of old national s fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series t to the treasury as part of the cpp program 
all of the series t preferred stock sold to the treasury was repurchased by old national on march  in addition to policy defined scenarios  old national models other scenarios to measure interest rate risk 
for example  the company models a yield curve based on a month forward curve 
the forward curve represents the market s expectations of future interest rates 
as of december   old national s month cumulative net interest income at risk for the scenario resulted in a increase in net interest income over an unchanged interest rate curve 
in addition  old national models a ramp scenario where current interest rates are increased basis points each quarter over a month timeframe 
as of december   old national s month cumulative net interest income at risk for this scenario resulted in a increase in net interest income over an unchanged interest rate curve 
we use derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  as one method to manage interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
our derivatives had an estimated fair value gain of million at december   compared to an estimated fair value loss of million at december  in addition  the notional amount of derivatives increased by million from see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 
liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and  along with the balance sheet management committee  monitors liquidity risk 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost effective manner 
management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities  funding sources  and loan and deposit forecasts 
we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth  properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements 
loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds 
however  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  the housing market  general and local economic conditions  and competition in the marketplace 
we continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments 
our ability to acquire funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies views of our credit quality  liquidity  capital and earnings 
all of the rating agencies place us in an investment grade that indicates a low risk of default 
for both old national and old national bank standard and poor s has issued unsolicited ratings with stable outlook as of november  dominion bond rating services has issued a stable outlook as of june  fitch rating services changed their long term outlook rating from negative to stable as of december  moody s investor service changed outlook to negative as of october

federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval 
prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years

we are party to various derivative contracts as a means to manage the balance sheet and our related exposure to changes in interest rates  to manage our residential real estate loan origination and sale activity  and to provide derivative contracts to our clients 
since the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet change frequently and do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  various legal actions and proceedings are pending against us and our affiliates which are incidental to the business in which they are engaged

further discussion of income taxes and liabilities recorded under fasb asc is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are contained in the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 
certain accounting policies require management to use significant judgments and estimates  which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions  actual results could differ from estimates  which could have a material affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board 

table of contents goodwill and intangibles description 
for acquisitions  we are required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under fasb asc sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset 
judgments and uncertainties 
the determination of fair values is based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
changes in these factors  as well as downturns in economic or business conditions  could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangible assets and could result in impairment losses affecting the financials of the company as a whole and the individual lines of business in which the goodwill or intangibles reside 
allowance for loan losses description 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses in the consolidated loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans  pools of homogeneous loans  assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
the allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense 
uncollectible loans are charged off through the allowance 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement 
our policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
we monitor the quality of our loan portfolio on an on going basis and use a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining the allowance for loan losses 
we record provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding  grade changes  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for our highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect our borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
we have a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews and regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
judgments and uncertainties 
we use migration analysis as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for non retail loans that are not impaired 
migration analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to estimate probable losses for existing pools of loans by matching actual losses incurred on loans back to their origination 

table of contents we calculate migration analysis using several different scenarios based on varying assumptions to evaluate the widest range of possible outcomes 
the migration derived historical commercial loan loss rates are applied to the current commercial loan pools to arrive at an estimate of probable losses for the loans existing at the time of analysis 
the amounts determined by migration analysis are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of allowance for consumer and residential real estate loans 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
management s analysis of probable losses in the portfolio at december   resulted in a range for allowance for loan losses of million with the potential effect to net income ranging from a decrease of million to an increase of million 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and are not intended to represent actual results 
derivative financial instruments description 
as part of our overall interest rate risk management  we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments

management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements 
all of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained 
we are not using the short cut method of accounting for any fair value derivatives

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective  as determined by fasb asc sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment  all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income  resulting in greater volatility in our earnings 
income taxes description 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and the municipalities in which we operate 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
we review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly  and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted as appropriate 
on january   we adopted fasb asc fin to account for uncertain tax positions 
fasb asc prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents judgments and uncertainties 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
valuation of securities description 
the fair value of our securities is determined with reference to price estimates 
in the absence of observable market inputs related to items such as cash flow assumptions or adjustments to market rates  management judgment is used 
different judgments and assumptions used in pricing could result in different estimates of value 
when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost for an extended period  we consider whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
if  in management s judgment  an other than temporary impairment exists  the portion of the loss in value attributable to credit quality is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings and the cost basis of the security is written down by this amount 
we consider the following factors when determining an other than temporary impairment for a security or investment the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the underlying fundamentals of the relevant market and the outlook for such market for the near future  our intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  and when applicable for purchased beneficial interests  the estimated cash flows of the securities are assessed for adverse changes 
quarterly  securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb asc sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and fasb asc emerging issues task force no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets and fasb asc fsp no 
fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
an impairment that is an other than temporary impairment is a decline in the fair value of an investment below its amortized cost attributable to factors that indicate the decline will not be recovered over the anticipated holding period of the investment 
other than temporary impairments result in reducing the security s carrying value by the amount of credit loss 
the credit component of the other than temporary impairment loss is realized through the statement of income and the remainder of the loss remains in other comprehensive income 
judgments and uncertainties 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing and amount of loss realization 
in addition  significant judgments are required in determining valuation and impairment  which include making assumptions regarding the estimated prepayments  loss assumptions and interest cash flows 

table of contents effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
actual credit deterioration could be more or less severe than estimated 
upon subsequent review  if cash flows have significantly improved  the discount would be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the debt security in a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of future cash flows 
additional credit deterioration resulting in an adverse change in cash flows would result in additional other than temporary impairment loss recorded in the income statement
