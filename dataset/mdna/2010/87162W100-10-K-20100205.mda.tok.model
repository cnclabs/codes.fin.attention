our business model is flexible and modular to accommodate the specific needs of our customers 
to further enhance our business process services solutions  we provide value added support services such as demand generation  pre sales support  product marketing  print and fulfillment  back office outsourcing and post sales technical support 

table of contents we combine our core strengths in distribution  demand generation  supply chain management  and contract assembly in an effort to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market  cost minimization  real time linkages in the supply chain and aftermarket product support 
we distribute to more than  technology products as measured by active skus from more than it oem suppliers to more than  resellers  system integrators  and retailers throughout the united states  canada and mexico 
we employ over  full time and temporary employees worldwide 
from a geographic perspective  approximately of our total revenue was from north america for the fiscal years ended november  and and for the fiscal year ended november  we purchase it systems  peripherals  system components  software and networking equipment from oem suppliers such as hewlett packard company  or hp  acer  panasonic  seagate and lenovo and sell them to our reseller and retail customers 
we perform a similar function for our purchases of licensed software products 
our reseller customers include vars  corporate resellers  government resellers  system integrators  direct marketers and retailers 
products purchased from our largest oem supplier  hp  accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended november    and  respectively 
revenue and cost of revenue we derive our revenue primarily through the distribution of it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  assembly services and bpo 
for products  we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
we review and adjust these provisions periodically 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we provide our bpo services in our gbs segment to customers under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service we offer 
our agreements are usually short term in nature  subject to early termination by our customers or us for any reason  typically with to days notice 
revenue is recognized as services are performed and if collection is reasonably assured 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal years  or approximately   and of our total revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively  was derived from the sale of hp products 
the distribution and contract assembly services industries in which we operate are characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
the market for it products and services is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
our overall business is also highly competitive on the basis of price 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide 
from time to time  we also participate in the incentive and rebate programs of our oem suppliers 
these programs are important determinants of the final sales price we charge to our reseller customers 
to mitigate the risk of declining prices and obsolescence of our distribution inventory  our oem suppliers generally offer us limited price protection and return rights for products that are marked down or discontinued by them 
we carefully manage our inventory to maximize the benefit to us of these supplier provided protections 
in our distribution segment  we are highly dependent on the end market demand for it products and services 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products  overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it industry and increased price based competition 

table of contents a significant portion of our cost of revenue is the purchase price we pay our oem suppliers for the products we sell  net of any rebates and purchase discounts received from our oem suppliers 
cost of product distribution revenue also consists of provisions for inventory losses and write downs  freight expenses associated with the receipt in and shipment out of our inventory  and royalties due to oem vendors 
in addition  cost of revenue includes the cost of materials  labor and overhead for our contract assembly and gbs services 
margins the it product industry in which we operate is characterized by low gross margin  and operating margin 
our gross margin has fluctuated between and annually over the past three years due to changes in the mix of products and services we offer  customers we sell to  incentives and rebates received from our oem suppliers  competition  seasonality and replacement of less profitable business with investments in higher margin and more profitable lines and lower costs associated with increased efficiencies 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin 
generally  when our revenue becomes more concentrated on limited products or customers  our gross margin tends to decrease due to increased pricing pressure from oem suppliers or reseller customers 
our operating margin from continuing operations has also fluctuated between and annually over the past three years  based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale  the management of our operating expenses  changes in the relative mix of our distribution  contract assembly and bpo revenue  and the timing of our acquisitions and investments 
recent acquisitions and divestitures we seek to augment our services offering growth with strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement and expand our global business services capabilities 
we also divest businesses that we deem not strategic to our ongoing operations 
our historical acquisitions have brought us new reseller customers  retail customers and oem suppliers  new product lines  extended the geographic reach of our operations  particularly targeted in international markets  and expanded the services we provide to our oem suppliers and customers 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and include acquired entities within our consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the acquisition 
acquisitions and divestitures during the year ended november  during the fiscal year ended november   we completed two acquisitions in our gbs segment 
through these acquisitions  we acquired web development services and complementary products for a total consideration of approximately million 
one of the acquisitions is reported under discontinued operations 
these acquisitions  individually and in the aggregate  did not meet the conditions of material business combinations 
on december   we completed the sale of our controlling interest in china civilink cayman  which operates in china as hichina web solutions  providing domain name registration  web site hosting and design  to alibaba 
com limited 
under the terms of the agreement  we received approximately million for our approximately controlling ownership in hichina web solutions  subject to a holdback for a period of six months 
we have agreed to guarantee the obligations of the holding company that sold hichina web solutions 
hichina web solutions was a part of our gbs segment 
acquisitions during the year ended november  during the fiscal year ended november   we completed the following acquisitions on april   we purchased substantially all of the assets of new age electronics inc  or new age  a privately held distributor of it and consumer electronics products to the us retail sector 
this acquisition expanded our consumer electronics distribution business 
we paid a purchase price of million in cash and 
table of contents an additional million was accrued  to be paid subject to compliance with certain post closing conditions 
as of november   we paid million of the accrual in full settlement of the additional payment 
the acquisition agreement provided for additional earn out payments to be paid subject to achieving certain milestones during the first twelve months after the date of acquisition 
during fiscal year  we paid million toward the final earn out payment 
in connection with the net assets acquired  we refinanced approximately million in working capital debt 
the new age business has been fully integrated into our distribution segment 
the purchase price allocation based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows fair value in thousands purchase consideration cash paid transaction cost allocation cash accounts receivable inventories program receivable fixed assets prepaid expenses and other assets goodwill intangible assets accounts payable accrued liabilities lease obligations loan payable intangible assets will be amortized over a period of ten years 
the following unaudited pro forma financial information combines the consolidated results of operations as if the acquisition of new age had occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented

table of contents building acquisition on july   we completed the purchase of a previously leased administrative and warehouse facility in fremont  california 
the facility is approximately one hundred twenty eight thousand square feet 
the total purchase price for this facility was approximately million 
restructuring charges in fiscal year  in connection with the acquisition of redmond group of companies  or rgc  we announced a restructuring program in canada 
the measures  which included workforce reductions  facilities consolidation and other related expenses  were intended to align our capacity and infrastructure  and utilize synergies within the business to provide more cost effective services to our customers 
during fiscal year  we accrued million in restructuring costs against goodwill related to the rgc acquisition in canada as required for business combinations accounted by utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
these charges were primarily associated with facilities consolidation of million  workforce reductions of million and contract termination costs of million 
during fiscal year  we recorded an additional restructuring accrual of million for the remaining lease obligations on the rgc facility 
the balance outstanding for facility and exit costs as of november  and was million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  in conjunction with the above  we recorded million for the restructuring  impairment and consolidation of our canadian operations as a result of the acquisition of rgc and the purchase of our logistics facility in guelph  canada in march these charges were primarily associated with million for facilities consolidation  million for workforce reductions  and million for other costs 
all charges were recorded in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  exit or disposal cost obligations 
the majority of all non continuing employees terminations were completed by november  this restructuring program was completed in fiscal year in conjunction with this restructuring program  we recorded an impairment loss of million for a property located in ontario  canada which is held for sale based on the fair value less costs to sell in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant and equipment  section  subsequent measurement 
the net book value of the property was million at november  in fiscal year  this property was sold for million at a loss of 
million 
in fiscal year  in connection with the acquisition of new age  we recorded liabilities of million  as required for business combinations accounted by utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
the measures  which included workforce reductions and facilities consolidation  that were intended to align our capacity and infrastructure  and utilize synergies within the business to provide more cost effective services to our customers 
these charges were primarily associated with workforce reductions of million and facilities consolidation of million 
this restructuring program was completed in fiscal year economic and industry trends our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for it products 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products and overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it distribution industry and increased price based competition 
the gbs industry is also extremely competitive 
the customers performance measures are based on competitive pricing terms and quality of services 
accordingly  we could be subject to pricing pressure and may experience a decline in our average selling prices for our services 
seasonality our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the it and consumer electronics products industries 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  
table of contents federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end users 
in addition  with the addition of new age in  which has a higher concentration of consumer electronics sales  we expect our fourth quarter seasonal spike may be larger 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan for a limited number of our directors and employees 
we maintain a liability on our balance sheet for salary and bonus amounts deferred by participants and we accrue interest expense on uninvested amounts 
interest expense on the deferred amounts is classified in interest expense and finance charges  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
the plan allows for the participants to essentially direct investments of deferred amounts in equity securities and other investments 
the equity securities are either classified as trading securities or cost securities 
generally  the gains losses on the deferred compensation securities are recorded in other income expense  net and an equal amount is charged or credited if losses to selling  general and administrative expenses relating to compensation amounts which are payable to the plan participants 
for the deferred compensation investments  we recorded a gain of million  a loss of million and a gain of million in the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussions and analyses of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to accounts receivable  vendor programs  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and a variety of other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
these provisions are reviewed and adjusted periodically by us 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we purchase licensed software products from oem vendors and distribute them to customers 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of software products when a purchase order exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
subsequent to the sale of software products  we generally have no obligation to provide any modification  customization  upgrades  enhancements  or any other post sales customer support 
our mexico operation primarily focuses on projects with the mexican government and other local agencies that are long term in nature 
under the agreements  the payments are due on a monthly basis and are contingent upon performing certain services and meeting certain conditions 
we recognize product revenue and cost of revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 

table of contents we provide our gbs services to our customers under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service we offer 
these agreements are usually short term in nature and subject to early termination by the customers or the company for any reason  typically with to days notice 
typically the contracts are time based or transactions based 
revenue is generally recognized over the term of the contract if the service has already been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for outstanding balances 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the accounts receivable  credit evaluations of customers financial condition and existence of credit insurance 
we also evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience with collections and value and adequacy of collateral received from customers 
oem supplier programs 
we receive funds from oem suppliers for inventory price protection  product rebates  marketing and infrastructure reimbursement  and promotion programs 
product rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue 
marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs are recorded  net of direct costs  in selling  general and administrative expense 
any excess funds associated with these programs are recorded in cost of revenue 
we accrue rebates based on the terms of the program and sales of qualifying products 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
amounts received or receivable from oem suppliers that are not yet earned are deferred on our balance sheet 
actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
in addition  oem suppliers may seek to change the terms of some or all of these programs or cease them altogether 
any such change could lower our gross margins on products we sell or revenue earned 
we also provide reserves for receivables on oem supplier programs for estimated losses resulting from oem suppliers inability to pay  or rejections of such claims by oem suppliers 
inventories 
our inventory levels are based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in our cost of revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  our ability to return to oem suppliers a certain percentage of our purchases  and protection from loss in value of inventory under our oem supplier agreements 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis during our fourth quarter  regardless if there is evidence or suspicion of impairment 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future undiscounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
factors we consider important  which may cause impairment  include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results 
no impairment loss was recorded for the periods presented 
in accordance with asc  intangible goodwill and other  a two step impairment test is required to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets 
table of contents assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
for the purpose of goodwill analysis  we have two reporting units  as defined by asc  intangible goodwill and other 
our distribution services business segment is comprised of one distribution services reporting unit and the gbs business segment is comprised of one contact center reporting unit 
we conducted our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge for the fiscal years ended  or determining the fair value of a reporting unit  intangible asset or a long lived asset is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions 
long lived assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
no impairment of long lived assets was recorded for the periods presented 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimating foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately considered more likely than not realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
actual results could differ from our estimates

as is customary in trade accounts receivable securitization arrangements  a credit rating agency s downgrade of the third party issuer of commercial paper or of a back up liquidity provider which provides a source of funding if the commercial paper market cannot be accessed could result in an increase in our cost of borrowing or loss of our financing capacity under these programs if the commercial paper issuer or liquidity back up provider is not replaced 
loss of such financing capacity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have a senior secured revolving line of credit arrangement  or the revolver  with a group of financial institutions

the vendor guarantees are typically less than one year arrangements  with day cancellation clauses and the lender guarantees are typically for the term of the loan agreement 
as of november  we had a liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits under certain tax positions 
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities  the table above excludes such liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements our canadian subsidiary  synnex canada limited  or synnex canada  replaced the accounts receivable securitization program in canada  with a secured revolving credit arrangement  or the canadian revolving arrangement  in may in connection with the canadian revolving arrangement  we pledged our stock in synnex canada 
prior to its replacement  the canadian arrangement was accounted for as an off balance sheet transaction because we funded the advances by selling rights  title and interest in us and canadian trade receivables  or canadian receivables  to the financial institution on a fully serviced basis 
the amount of our canadian receivables sold to the financial institution and not yet collected from customers as of november  was million 
under the terms and conditions of the canadian revolving arrangement the accounts receivable portion is accounted for as an on balance sheet financing arrangement 
covenants compliance in relation to our us amended and restated arrangement  the amended and restated revolver and the canadian revolving arrangement  we have a number of covenants and restrictions that  among other things  require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants and restrict our ability to incur additional debt 
these covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  including minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratio 
they also limit our ability to make or forgive intercompany loans  pay dividends and make distributions  make certain acquisitions  repurchase our stock  create liens  cancel debt owed to us  enter into agreements with affiliates  modify the nature of our business  enter into sale leaseback transactions  make certain investments  enter into new real estate leases  transfer and sell assets  cancel or terminate any material contracts and merge or consolidate 
the covenants also limit our ability to pay cash upon conversion  redemption or repurchase of the convertible senior notes subject to certain liquidity tests 
as of november   we were in compliance with all material covenants for the above arrangements 

table of contents convertible debt in may  we issued million of aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due  or the notes  in a private placement 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest on the notes is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning november  in addition  we will pay contingent interest in respect of any six month period from may to november or from november to may  with the initial six month period commencing may   if the trading price of the notes for each of the ten trading days immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals or more of the principal amount of the notes 
during any interest period when contingent interest is payable  the contingent interest payable per note is equal to of the average trading price of the notes during the ten trading days immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period 
the notes mature on may   subject to earlier redemption  repurchase or conversion 
holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for such notes under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter after the fiscal quarter ended august  and only during such fiscal quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is equal to or more than of the conversion price of the notes on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period  or the measurement period  in which the trading price per  principal amount of the notes for each day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate of the notes on each such day  if we have called the particular notes for redemption  until the close of business on the business day prior to the redemption date  or upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions 
in addition  holders may also convert their notes at their option at any time beginning on november   and ending at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the notes  without regard to the foregoing circumstances 
upon conversion  we will pay or deliver  as the case may be  cash  shares of the common stock or a combination thereof at our election 
the initial conversion rate for the notes will be shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest  including any additional interest and any contingent interest 
we may not redeem the notes prior to may  we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash on or after may   at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to including any additional interest and any contingent interest  but excluding  the redemption date 
holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on may  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to including any additional interest and any contingent interest  but excluding  the repurchase date 
if we undergo a fundamental change  holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to including any additional interest and any contingent interest  but excluding  the fundamental change repurchase date 
the notes are senior  unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally in right of payment with other senior unsecured debt and rank senior to subordinated notes  if any 
the notes effectively rank junior to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the notes are also structurally subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments including trade payables of our subsidiaries 
the net proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes and to reduce outstanding balances under the us arrangement and the revolver 

table of contents the notes are governed by an indenture  dated as of may   between us and us bank national association  as trustee  which contains customary events of default 
the notes as hybrid instruments are accounted as convertible debt and are recorded at carrying value with no separate accounting for the conversion features 
the right of the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change and the contingent interest feature would require separate measurement from the notes  however  the amount is insignificant 
the additional shares issuable following certain corporate transactions do not require bifurcation and separate measurement from the notes 
related party transactions we have a business relationship with mitac international  a publicly traded company in taiwan  that began in when it became our primary investor through its affiliates 
as of november   mitac international and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
in addition  matthew miau  the chairman emeritus of our board of directors  is also the chairman of mitac international and a director or officer of mitac international s affiliates 
as a result  mitac international generally has significant influence over us and over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for consideration  including any merger or acquisition of ours 
among other things  this could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control over us with the loss of any premium that stockholders otherwise might receive in connection with such a transaction 
we work closely with mitac international to collaborate on oem outsourcing opportunities and jointly market mitac international s design and electronic manufacturing services and our contract assembly capabilities 
this relationship has enabled us to build relationships with mitac international s customers and we continue to work with and depend on mitac international to jointly serve our shared customers 
we purchased inventories  including notebook computers  motherboards and other peripherals  from mitac international and its affiliates totaling approximately million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
our sales to mitac international and its affiliates during fiscal years  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
most of these purchases and sales were pursuant to our master supply agreement with mitac international and sun microsystems  one of our contract assembly customers 
our business relationship to date with mitac international has been informal and is not governed by long term commitments or arrangements with respect to pricing terms  revenue or capacity commitments 
accordingly  we negotiate manufacturing  pricing and other material terms on a case by case basis with mitac international and our contract assembly customers for a given project 
while mitac international is a related party and a controlling stockholder  we believe that the significant terms under these agreements  including pricing  would not materially differ from the terms we could have negotiated with unaffiliated third parties  and we have adopted a policy requiring that material transactions with mitac international or its related parties be approved by our audit committee  which is composed solely of independent directors 
in addition  mr 
miau s compensation is approved by the nominating and corporate governance committee  which is also composed solely of independent directors 
as mitac international s ownership interest in us decreases as a result of sales of our stock and additional dilution  its interest in the success of our business and operations may decrease as well 
we remain dependent on mitac international as a contract assembly partner 
any change in the pricing or other material terms demanded by mitac international could have a material adverse effect on our business  particularly our contract assembly business with sun microsystems 

table of contents beneficial ownership of our common stock by mitac international 
as noted above  mitac international and its affiliates in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately of our common stock as of november  these shares are owned by the following entities mitac international synnex technology international corp 
total shares are held via silver star developments ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of mitac international

synnex technology international corp  or synnex technology international  is a separate entity from us and is a publicly traded corporation in taiwan 
shares held via peer development ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of synnex technology international 
mitac international owns a minority interest in mitac incorporated  a privately held taiwanese company  which in turn holds a minority interest in synnex technology international 
while the ownership structure of mitac international and its affiliates is complex  it has not had a material adverse effect on our business in the past  and we do not expect it to do so in the future 
during fiscal year  we purchased shares of mitac international and one of its affiliates related to the deferred compensation plan of robert huang  our then president and chief executive officer 
during fiscal year  we purchased additional shares of mitac international related to mr 
huang s deferred compensation plan and in had no such purchases 
as of november   the value of the investment was million 
except as described herein  none of our officers or directors has an interest in mitac international or its affiliates 
synnex technology international is a publicly traded corporation in taiwan that currently provides distribution and fulfillment services to various markets in asia and australia  and is also a potential competitor of ours 
neither mitac international nor synnex technology international is restricted from competing with us 
in the future  we may increasingly compete with synnex technology international  particularly if our business in asia expands or synnex technology international expands its business into geographies or customers we serve 
although synnex technology international is a separate entity from us  it is possible that there will be confusion as a result of the similarity of our names 
moreover  we cannot limit or control the use of the synnex name by synnex technology international in certain geographies and our use of the synnex name may be restricted as a result of registration of the name by synnex technology international or the prior use in jurisdictions where it currently operates
