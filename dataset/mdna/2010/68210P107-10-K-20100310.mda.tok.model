the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company appearing under item of this report 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings or stockholders equity 
company overview business 
omega is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
the company s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers  and its refined fish oil products are used in food production  feed production and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as protein additives for animal feed and as fertilizers 
fishing 
the company s harvesting season generally extends from early may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from mid april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season or in some cases  by re selling meal and oil purchased from other suppliers 
the fish catch is processed into three general types of products  fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles at the company s four meal and oil processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia 
on september   the company s abbeville and cameron  louisiana fish processing facilities were damaged by hurricane ike 
both of these facilities were non operational immediately after the hurricane 
operations at the abbeville fish processing facility were restored to full capacity on september  the cameron fish processing facility was fully functional prior to the beginning of the fishing season 
these hurricane damages adversely affected the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the direct impact of the hurricane upon the company was a loss of physical inventories and physical damage to the plants 
the interruption of processing capabilities caused the company to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities  which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs 
the amounts of these losses are more fully described in notes   and to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the company experienced higher costs of production and below average fish catch 
the higher costs of production were primarily attributed to increased energy  labor and repair costs 
the reduced fish catch was primarily attributable to adverse weather conditions mainly associated with hurricane activity 
as a result of the higher costs of production and below average fish catch  the company experienced significantly higher per unit product costs approximately increase as compared to the fishing season which adversely affected the company s earnings for the impacts of higher cost inventories were carried forward and adversely affected the company s earnings through the second quarter of in addition  the lost fishing days resulted in lower product volumes available for sale in the first half of these higher cost product inventories carried forward from the fishing season were largely sold as of june  during  the company reduced overall costs of production by approximately million as compared to by lowering and  in some cases  eliminating certain expenses  renegotiating more favorable vendor contracts  and fixing energy prices via energy swaps more fully explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  due to lower than average fish catch  the company continued to experience higher per unit product costs which contributed to lower than anticipated company earnings for the second half of the impacts of these higher cost inventories will be carried forward and may adversely affect the company s earnings for the first and second quarters of 
table of contents harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the company s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch tons production tons fish meal regular grade special select sea lac oil crude refined solubles total production fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 
the company s harvesting and processing business is seasonal and fluctuates from year to year and month to month due to natural conditions over which the company has no control 
for illustrative purposes  the company s oil yields for the fishing season were the poorest in recent history and lower by compared to those in the fishing season and were lower by compared to the company s year oil yield average 
the causes of lower fish oil yields are believed to relate to fish diet  weather and water temperature but are not generally well understood 
oil yields for the year ended december  have been consistent with those experienced over the last several years 
markets 
pricing for the company s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  the company has implemented a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
during  the company s production percentage of specialty meal products was approximately of total meal production 
during and  the company s specialty meal production percentage accounted for and  respectively  of total meal production 
future volumetric growth in specialty meal sales will be dependent upon increased harvesting efforts and market demand 
additionally  the company is attempting to introduce its refined fish oil into the food market 
the company has made sales  which to date have not been material  of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic or international markets for omega pure or how long it may take to develop these markets 
during  the company expanded its purchase and resale of other manufacturers fish meal and fish oil products which focused initially on the purchase and resale of mexican fish meal and fish oil 
in  revenues generated from these types of transactions represented less than of total company revenues 
during  and  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions  and the company further expanded its purchase and resale of other fish meals and oils primarily panamanian  peruvian and mexican fish meal and us menhaden oil 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from the company s base domestic production  these operations provide the company with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets  
table of contents some of which  the company has not historically had a presence 
the company purchased products totaling approximately  tons  or approximately of total volume sales for the fiscal year ended december  the company did not purchase any fish meal or fish oil during during the year ended december   the company purchased approximately  tons of menhaden fish meal  or approximately of fish meal sales volumes for the same period 
the company sells a portion of its products on a two to twelve month forward contract basis with the balance sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
during  and approximately  and  respectively  of the company s fish meals and crude fish oil had been sold on a forward contract basis prior to those years respective fishing season 
the percentage of fish meal and crude fish oil sold on a forward contract basis will fluctuate from year to year based upon perceived market availability and forward price expectations 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on pricing  annual fish catch  production yields and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to the next year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on existing contracts  prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  the company attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and  therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth the company s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent regular grade special select sealac crude oil refined oil fish solubles other total critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments used in applying the company s most critical accounting policies has a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results  and requires the company to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include valuation of inventory notes and  valuation of losses related to jones act and worker s compensation insurance claims note  valuation of income and deferred taxes notes and and the valuation of pension plan obligations notes and 
the company also has other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to the allowance of doubtful accounts note  valuation of shares based compensation note and interest rate and energy swap 
table of contents valuations notes and 
the company believes that these other key accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies
