item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management s discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of intervest bancshares corporation and subsidiaries that follows should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this report on form k 
intervest bancshares corporation has two wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries  intervest national bank and intervest mortgage corporation 
intervest bancshares corporation  intervest national bank and intervest mortgage corporation may be referred to individually as ibc  inb and imc  respectively  in this report 
ibc also has four wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiaries  intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v  all of which were formed at various times in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities 
references in this report to we  us and our refer to intervest bancshares corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries  unless otherwise specified 
for a detailed discussion of our business  see item business in this report critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis herein is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained in our financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are reasonable and made in good faith 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that relate to the determination of our allowance for loan losses  valuation allowance for real estate losses  and other than temporary impairment charges on our security investments 
these three items are considered critical accounting estimates because each is highly susceptible to change from period to period and require us to make numerous assumptions about a variety of information that directly affect the calculation of the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
for example  the impact of a large unexpected chargeoff could deplete the allowance for loan losses and potentially require us to record increased loan loss provisions to replenish the allowance  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
for a summary of our other significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses reflects our judgment as to the estimated credit losses that may result from defaults in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a loan loss provision charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal amount of the loans is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of previous chargeoffs are added back to the allowance 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses at least monthly or more frequently when necessary with consideration given to the following factors i size of the loans in the portfolio 
the loan portfolio has many individual loans with large principal balances  which increases the portfolio s risk profile 
at december   the average real estate loan was million  with the largest loan being million 
in addition  loans with principal balances of million or more represented approximately of the portfolio  
table of contents ii nature concentration of the loans in the portfolio 
the loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate  including some vacant properties and vacant land  all of which are generally considered to have more credit risk than traditional family residential lending because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to single borrowers and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate for income producing properties 
loans on vacant properties and vacant land typically do not have adequate or any income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment 
the number of vacant land loans in the portfolio however has decreased substantially over the last several years 
the properties collateralizing the loans in our portfolio are also concentrated by location  and this concentration also increases the risk associated with the portfolio 
the properties are concentrated in two states  new york and florida  and many are located in geographical areas that are being revitalized or redeveloped  which are negatively impacted to a greater degree in an economic downturn 
both of these states are experiencing weak economic conditions  high rates of unemployment  increased office and retail vacancy rates and lower commercial real estate values 
additionally  many of the multifamily properties located in new york city and surrounding boroughs are also subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents  which may in turn limit the borrower s ability to repay those mortgage loans 
all of the above factors increase the risk profile of our loan portfolio  iii specific problem loans  including loans on nonaccrual status  and estimates of fair value of the underlying properties 
whenever a loan experiences payment problems  an internal review of that loan is performed by one or both of our two senior lending officers the chairman and the president of inb to re evaluate the internal credit rating that is assigned to the loan 
this credit rating directly affects the computation of the allowance for loan losses 
the estimated loss factors that we apply to our loans to calculate the allowance for loan losses increase as a loan s credit rating decreases 
nonaccrual and other problem loans are normally downgraded based on known facts and circumstances at the time of review  which in turn impacts the level of the allowance for loan losses 
the review includes the physical inspection of such properties and the monitoring of impositions and insurance premiums to preserve our security interest in the properties 
additionally  we engage independent third parties to perform quarterly loan portfolio reviews  which include all loans on nonaccrual status 
we also take into consideration the nature and extent of the collateralization of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days and still accruing and any other problem loans  including loans that have been restructured and categorized as troubled debt restructurings  in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
estimates of fair value of the collateral properties is determined based on a variety of information  including available appraisals  broker opinions of value and the knowledge and experience of our two senior lending officers as it relates to values of properties in our lending markets 
the determination of the need for updated appraisals is made on a loan by loan basis 
in addition to appraisals  consideration is also given to the type  location and occupancy of the property and current economic conditions in the area the property is located in assessing estimates of fair value  iv historical chargeoffs and recoveries 
we have experienced a limited number of loan charge offs and recoveries to date 
in computing the allowance for loan losses  we currently do not place much reliance on our historical losses as an indicator of future losses 
in determining potential losses that may exist in the loan portfolio  we place a greater weight on the current level and type of nonaccrual and problem loans and the specific facts and circumstances associated with each loan  v adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay 
all nonaccrual and problem loans are reviewed individually based on the facts and circumstances known to us at the time of the review 
based on these reviews  our two senior lending officers make an assessment as to whether there are specific issues unique to each problem loan or whether such issues identified are generic to the portfolio  which may in turn necessitate a change to the overall estimated loss factors that are used to calculate the allowance  vi the perception of our two senior lending officers of current and anticipated economic conditions in our primary lending areas  which are concentrated in new york and florida  and national economic conditions 
our loan portfolio has and continues to been negatively impacted by the weak economies in florida and new york  including the impact of high rates of unemployment  increased office and retail vacancy rates and lower real estate values 

table of contents we have also experienced the effects of misconduct committed by certain of our borrowers  which required us to place certain loans that are collateralized by income producing properties on nonaccrual status  and in some instances due to involuntary bankruptcy filings filed against the borrowers by third party creditors 
such filings resulted in the cessation of monthly loan payments despite cash flows being generated by the underlying property 
we also continue to experience delays in our ability to move forward with foreclosure or other proceedings to acquire and sell collateral properties  which could also negatively affect our ability to recover our principal  particularly in a period where real estate values are decreasing 
these factors have increased the level of risk in our loan portfolio and will likely continue to negatively impact the portfolio for some period of time  vii trends in loan volume and loan terms  changes in risk selection  underwriting standards and lending policies and procedures 
we have not relaxed our underwriting standards or our lending policies and procedures 
we believe we have become more risk averse by being more selective in originating loans in the current economic environment 
loan to value ratios the ratio that the original principal amount of the loan bears to the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the property securing the loan at the time of origination on new loans typically do not exceed 
debt service coverage ratios the ratio of the net operating income generated by the property securing the loan to the required debt service on new real estate loans typically are not less than times  and viii experience  ability and depth of our lending officers and other underwriting staff 
all potential new loans are referred to one of our two senior lending officers  both of whom have substantial experience in commercial and multifamily real estate lending 
all loans originated by us must be first reviewed and approved by our loan committee  which is comprised of three members of our board of directors 
we believe that there is substantial lending experience and depth on both our lending staff and loan committee 
based on our assessment of all the factors discussed above  we maintain an allowance for loan losses that is comprised of an unallocated portion which is derived from estimated loss factors currently ranging from to multiplied by the principal amount of loans rated acceptable  and higher percentages for loans that are assigned a lower credit grade such as special mention and substandard and an allocated or specific portion on loans that have been identified as being impaired 
gaap specifies how the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is computed 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment for larger balance loans such as our portfolio of commercial real estate and multifamily loans are measured based on one of the following methods the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the observable market price of the loan  or the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral  if payment of the principal and interest is dependent upon the collateral 
when the fair value of the property is less than the recorded investment in the loan  this deficiency is recognized as a specific valuation allowance recorded as part of the overall allowance for loan losses with a charge to expense through the provision for loan losses 
we consider a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimal delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by us that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
in evaluating loans for impairment  we generally consider delinquencies of days or less to be minimal delays  and accordingly do not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
our impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings 
generally  all of our loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan by loan basis using the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral 
we believe  based on information known to us at december   that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to cover estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio at such date 
although we believe we use the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if facts and circumstances differ from those previously assumed in the determination of the allowance 

table of contents for example  a prolonged downturn in real estate values and economic conditions could have an adverse impact on our asset quality and may result in an increase in future loan charge offs and loan loss provisions  and may also result in the decrease in the estimated value of real estate we acquired through foreclosure 
additionally  our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and the estimated values of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
accordingly  we may be required to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses  or record write downs on the carrying values of foreclosed real estate based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination 
we also maintain a valuation allowance for real estate we acquire through foreclosure or similar proceedings 
we estimate the fair value of our real estate in the same manner as impaired loans 
as the properties are actively marketed for sale  we may periodically adjust the carrying values of the real estate to reflect changes in fair values resulting from changing market conditions through an increase to the valuation allowance for real estate losses and a charge to the provision for real estate losses for a discussion of the factors and estimates used in computing other than temporary impairment charges on our security investments  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements

cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  the level of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates based on various factors  including liquidity needs  loan demand  deposit flows  calls of securities  repayments of borrowed funds and alternative investment opportunities 
security investments security investments consist of securities held to maturity and federal reserve bank frb and federal home loan bank of new york fhlb stock 
securities are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost when we have the intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
such investments  all of which are held by inb  increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase reflected million of new purchases exceeding a total of million of calls and maturities of securities during the period 
at december   securities held to maturity consisted of investment grade rated debt obligations of the federal home loan bank  federal farm credit bank  federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation totaling million and noninvestment grade rated corporate securities consisting of variable rate pooled trust preferred securities backed by obligations of companies in the banking industry totaling million 
as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  inb recorded impairment charges totaling million in on six trust preferred security investments 
at december   the securities held to maturity portfolio had a weighted average yield of and a weighted average remaining maturity of years  compared to and years  respectively  at december  nearly all of the securities have fixed interest rates or have predetermined rate increases  and have call features that allow the issuer to call the security before its stated maturity without penalty

the total required investment  which amounted to million at december   compared to million at december   fluctuates based on inb s capital level for the frb stock and inb s loans and outstanding fhlb borrowings for the fhlb stock 
loans receivable  net of deferred fees loans receivable  net of deferred fees  decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  the decrease was due to the aggregate of million of principal repayments  million of loans transferred to foreclosed real estate and million of loan chargeoffs exceeding million of new loan originations  nearly all of which are secured by commercial real estate 
the new loans are nearly all fixed rate with a weighted average yield and term of and years  respectively 
the terms of the loans have largely been a function of the demand by borrowers for longer term  fixed rate product that has been driven by the historically low interest rate environment 
new loan originations for amounted to million 
the lower level of originations in reflects the effects of a decrease in suitable lending opportunities for inb as well as inb s efforts to maintain its loan portfolio at a prudent level relative to its increased capital requirements 

table of contents we expect this demand for longer term  fixed rate product to continue and expect that most of our new loan originations in will have similar terms

nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans increased to million loans at december   from million loans at december  at december  and  there were million loans and million loan of loans  respectively  that were classified as ninety days past due and still accruing interest 
these loans were past their maturity date but the borrower continues to make monthly loan payments 
at december   there also were million of accruing loans with a weighted average interest rate of on which inb has granted certain concessions to the borrowers to provide payment relief to the borrower generally consisting of the deferral of principal and or interest payments for a period of time  or a partial reduction in interest payments 
these loans are considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
nonaccrual loans and tdrs are considered impaired under gaap 
at december   nonaccrual loans had a specific valuation allowance included as part of the overall allowance for loan losses in the aggregate amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   there was an additional specific valuation allowance of million maintained for tdrs 
at december   there were also million of loans for which there were concerns regarding the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  the allowance represented of total loans net of deferred fees outstanding at december  compared to at december  the increase in the allowance was due to million of loan loss provisions and a million partial recovery of a prior chargeoff  partially offset by million of new chargeoffs 
the loan loss provision of million was attributable to downgrades of internal risk ratings on both accrual and nonaccrual loans and lower estimates of real estate values on certain collateral properties

table of contents accrued interest receivable fluctuates based on the level of interest earning assets and the timing of interest payments received 
loan fees receivable are fees due to us in accordance with the terms of our mortgage loans 
such amounts are generally due upon the full repayment of the loan 
this fee is recorded as deferred income at the time a loan is originated and is then amortized to interest income over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment 
the decrease was due to payments exceeding new fees that were charged on new loan originations as well as a lower level of new originations 
premises and equipment decreased as purchases were more than offset by normal depreciation and amortization 
the deferred tax asset relates to the unrealized benefit for net temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that will result in future income tax deductions 
the increase in the deferred tax asset is primarily a function of the net increase in the allowance for loan losses  valuation allowance for real estate losses and capitalized real estate expenses which will become tax deductible when actual chargeoffs or are incurred 
deferred debenture offering costs consist primarily of underwriters commissions and are amortized over the terms of the debentures 
the net decrease was due to normal amortization as well as the accelerated expensing of costs associated with early repayments of debentures prior to their contractual maturity dates

net interest and dividend income net interest and dividend income is our primary source of earnings and is influenced by the amount  distribution and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as by the relative levels and movements of interest rates 
net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
as detailed in the following table  net interest and dividend income increased by million to million in  from million in  primarily due to an improved net interest margin and an increase in our average balance sheet 
total average interest earning assets increased by million in from  due to growth of million in loans and million in security and other short term investments in the aggregate

consists of the recognition of any unamortized premium or discount at time of call 
consists of other than temporary impairment charges on trust preferred security investments which are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
the decrease in customer s service fees was due to a lower level of income from early withdrawal penalties  while the decrease in income from mortgage lending activities was due to less inspection charges resulting from a lower level of new originations 
we believe that the volume of loan prepayments and prepayment income derived therefrom has decreased over the last several years due to longer term  fixed rate loans that we have originated since the beginning of  as well as the effects of the crisis in the credit markets in general which severely reduced funds available in the general marketplace for real estate lending as well as declining commercial real estate values

we had employees at both december  and occupancy and equipment expense increased primarily due to higher real estate taxes and a decrease in sublease rental income 
data processing expense increased due to the growth in inb s assets 
inb uses a third party service provider to run its core computer system 
such cost is based on total assets 
professional fees and services increased primarily due to a higher level of legal costs incurred in our collection efforts with nonaccrual loans as well as increased internal and external audit fees  consulting fees and regulatory examination fees 
fdic insurance expense increased due to a higher rate structure for insurance premiums and a one time assessment imposed by the fdic on all insured financial institutions as well as growth in our deposits 
for a further discussion  see the section deposit insurance assessments under the caption supervision and regulation in item business of his report 
general insurance expense also increased due to higher premiums 
real estate activities expense is comprised of expenditures consisting of real estate taxes  insurance  utilities and other charges required to protect our interest in real estate acquired through foreclosure and or various properties collateralizing our nonaccrual loans

provisions for real estate losses represent writedowns of foreclosed properties 
after foreclosure  we periodically perform market valuations of properties we own and hold for sale 
decreases in the estimated fair value of the properties are recorded as an increase to the valuation allowance and a charge to the provision for real estate losses 
the loss on the early extinguishment of debentures represents unamortized issuance costs that were expensed in connection with the repayment of debentures prior to their stated maturity as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
our efficiency ratio  which is a measure of its ability to control our expenses as a percentage of our revenues  was for  compared to for this ratio has been negatively affected primarily by the impact of nonperforming assets and related loss of net interest income  and higher fdic insurance expense

net interest and dividend income net interest and dividend income is our primary source of earnings and is influenced by the amount  distribution and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as by the relative levels and movements of interest rates 
net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest and dividend income decreased by million to million in  from million in nearly all of the decrease was due to the impact of nonaccrual loans

intervest national bank 
inb s lending business is dependent on its ability to generate a positive interest rate spread between the yields earned on its loans and the rates offered on its deposits 
inb needs to pay competitive interest rates to attract and retain deposits to fund its loan originations 
inb relies heavily on certificates of deposit time deposits as its main source of funds 
consolidated deposits amounted to billion at december  and time deposits represented or billion of those deposits  down from at december   which is the result of a increase in money market deposit accounts to million at december  such increase is attributable the low interest rate environment and depositors preference to maintain liquid deposit accounts 
time deposits of  or more at december  totaled million  compared to million at december   and included million and million of brokered deposits at each date  respectively 
brokered deposits had a weighted average remaining term and stated interest rate of years and  respectively  at december  and million of those deposits mature by december  inb s brokered deposits are sold by investment firms  which are paid a fee by inb for placing the deposit 
inb must maintain its status as a well capitalized insured depository institution in order to solicit and accept  renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction 
additionally  inb has agreed with the occ not to have its total brokered deposits exceed of inb s total deposits without obtaining prior approval of the occ 
time deposits are the only deposit accounts offered by inb that have stated maturity dates

at december   the securities held to maturity portfolio had a weighted average remaining stated maturity of years and million  or  matures by december   excluding potential calls 
inb s current goal is to target its loan to deposit ratio in a range from to 
this ratio was at december  compared to at december  in  a decrease in suitable lending opportunities for inb as well as inb s efforts to maintain its loan portfolio at a prudent level relative to its increased capital requirements negatively impacted this ratio

intervest bancshares corporation 
ibc s current sources of funds are derived from the following interest income from short term investments  monthly dividends from inb  and monthly management fees from imc and inb for providing these subsidiaries with certain administrative services 
ibc s historical sources of working capital have been derived from the issuance of its common stock through public offerings  exercise of common stock warrants and conversion of debentures  the issuance of trust preferred securities through its wholly owned business trusts  the issuance of its preferred stock to the u

we are not aware of any trends  known demand  commitments or uncertainties other than those discussed above or elsewhere in this report that are expected to have a material impact on future operating results  liquidity or capital resources of each entity 
however  there can be no assurances that adverse conditions may not arise in the credit and capital markets that would adversely impact our liquidity and ability to raise funds either through attracting deposits  from borrowings or sales of assets to meet our operations and satisfy our outstanding lending commitments and maturing liabilities  or raise new working capital if needed 
in light of the higher capital requirements for which inb is currently subject to as well as our current level of nonperforming assets  ibc intends to explore in capital raising alternatives

since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
regulatory capital inb is subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
as discussed in item business of this report  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and other bank regulatory agencies use five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized to determine various matters  including prompt corrective action and each institution s fdic deposit insurance premiums 
these categories involve quantitative measures of a bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on inb s and our financial statements 
regulations require banks to maintain regulatory defined minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based capital ratio levels of at least  and  respectively 
at december   inb maintained its regulatory capital at levels to be classified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  which requires minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based capital ratios of  and  respectively 
in april  inb agreed with the occ  its primary regulator  to maintain minimum capital ratios at specified levels higher than those otherwise required by applicable regulations as follows tier capital to total average assets leverage ratio  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets 
inb believes that it has met its capital adequacy requirements as of december  and as of the date of filing of this report on form k  we are not aware of any conditions or events that would have changed inb s or ibc s compliance with each of its regulatory capital requirements 
there can be no assurances that inb will not be required to maintain is regulatory capital at even higher levels in the future 

table of contents information regarding inb s regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized as follows at december  in thousands tier capital tier capital total risk based capital net risk weighted assets average assets for regulatory purposes tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets ibc on a consolidated basis is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements administered by the frb 
these guidelines require a ratio of tier or core capital  as defined in the guidelines  to total risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
the guidelines also require a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total average assets of not less than 
at december  and  ibc believes that it met its capital adequacy requirements 
information regarding consolidated regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized as follows at december  in thousands tier capital tier capital total risk based capital net risk weighted assets average assets for regulatory purposes tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital includes million of qualifying trust preferred securities  which represent outstanding debentures issued to intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v by ibc  net of the ibc s investments in those trusts 
the inclusion of these securities in tier capital is currently limited to of core capital elements  as defined in the fdic regulations 
tier capital also includes million of cumulative perpetual preferred stock sold to the us treasury for which there is no limit 
in march  the federal reserve board announced the adoption of a final rule that delays until march   the effective date of new limits on the inclusion of trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements in tier capital of all bank holding companies bhcs 
these new limits were scheduled to take effect on march  until the new effective date in  all bhcs may include cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities in tier capital up to percent of total core capital elements excluding senior preferred stock issued to the us treasury  all of which qualifies as tier capital without restriction 
through march   bank holding companies bhcs generally must calculate their tier capital on a basis that limits the aggregate amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities to percent of the sum of qualifying common stockholder s equity  qualifying noncumulative and cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus  qualifying minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and qualifying trust preferred securities 
amounts of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities in excess of this limit may be included in tier capital 
beginning march   qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock excluding senior preferred stock issued to the us treasury  all of which qualifies as tier capital without restriction and qualifying trust preferred securities  as well as certain types of minority interest  are limited to percent of the sum of core capital elements net of goodwill 
we do not have any goodwill or minority interests 
additionally  the excess amounts of restricted core capital elements in the form of qualifying trust preferred securities included in tier capital are limited to percent of tier capital net of goodwill 

table of contents however  amounts in excess of this limit will still be taken into account in the overall assessment of an organization s funding and financial condition 
in the last five years before the underlying subordinated note matures  the associated trust preferred securities must be treated as limited life preferred stock 
thus  in the last five years of the life of the note  the outstanding amount of trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital and included in tier capital  subject  together with subordinated debt and other limited life preferred stock  to a limit of percent of tier capital 
during this period  the trust preferred securities will be amortized out of tier capital by one fifth of the original amount less redemptions each year and excluded totally from tier capital during the last year of life of the underlying note 
as of december   assuming ibc s eligible trust preferred securities were excluded from its tier capital and instead included in its tier capital  ibc would still have exceeded the well capitalized threshold under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
consolidated proforma capital ratios at december  would have been  and  respectively

asset and liability management our interest rate risk arises from differences in the repricing of our assets and liabilities within a given time period 
the primary objective of our asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital 
we have never engaged in trading or hedging activities  nor invested in interest rate derivatives or entered into interest rate swaps 
we use gap analysis  which measures the difference between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period  to monitor our interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on our net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
callable features of certain assets and liabilities  in addition to the foregoing  may also cause actual experience to vary from the analysis 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  may have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different from those assumed in the gap analysis 

table of contents we have a limited number of floating rate loans that have a floor or minimum rate that was determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
this feature reduces the unfavorable effect on interest income of a falling rate environment because the interest rates on such loans do not reset downward 
we may nonetheless experience loan prepayments  the amount of which cannot be predicted  and reinvestment risk associated with the investment of the resulting proceeds 
the number of floating rate loans in our loan portfolio has decreased significantly over the last several years 
to illustrate  fixed rate loans constituted approximately of our loan portfolio at december   compared to approximately at december  there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may not adversely impact our earnings and capital  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the table below summarizes interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   that are scheduled to mature or reprice within the periods shown 
in thousands months months over years over years total loans securities held to maturity short term investments frb and fhlb stock total rate sensitive assets deposit accounts interest checking deposits savings deposits money market deposits certificates of deposit total deposits fhlb advances debentures and mortgage note payable accrued interest on all borrowed funds total borrowed funds total rate sensitive liabilities gap repricing differences cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets significant assumptions used in preparing the gap table above follow adjustable rate loans and debentures payable are included in the period in which their interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they mature 
fixed rate loans  debentures payable and fhlb advances are scheduled  including repayments  according to their contractual maturities 
deferred loan fees and the effect of possible loan prepayments are excluded from the analysis 
nonaccrual loans of million and foreclosed real estate of million are also excluded from the table although some portion is expected to return to an interest earning status in the near term 
securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their contractual maturity or the date in which the interest rate is scheduled to increase 
the effects of possible prepayments that may result from the issuer s right to call a security before its contractual maturity date are not considered in the analysis 
the net carrying value million of corporate securities that are on a cash basis of accounting are excluded from the table 
interest checking  savings and money market deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts and certificates of deposit are scheduled according to their contractual maturity dates 

table of contents at december   our interest bearing liabilities that are scheduled to mature or reprice within one year exceeded our interest earning assets that are scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
this one year interest rate sensitivity gap amounted to a negative million  or of total assets  at december   compared to a negative million  or of total assets at december  as a result of the negative one year gap  we are liability sensitive  indicating that our interest bearing liabilities would generally reprice with changes in interest rates more rapidly than our interest earning assets 
the change in the one year gap from december  was primarily due to the following the continued runoff of accruing loans with a repricing or remaining maturity of less than one year being replaced with new fixed rate loans with maturities averaging years  an increase in nonaccrual loans  and purchases of security investments with maturities averaging years 
the new loans and securities have been funded largely through an increase in money market accounts 
inb s deposit flows and deposit rates offered are monitored daily and adjusted as needed 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  inb has emphasized the attraction of longer term deposits by offering competitive rates on these products and being less competitive on the rates offered for shorter term deposits 
notwithstanding this strategy  inb has still experienced a significant inflow of money market deposit accounts 
there can be no assurance that the behavior of depositors will match our expectations 
inb s objective is to maintain its deposit rates at levels that will promote a stable deposit base and at the same time adjust to its cash flow needs 
inb  whose assets represent of consolidated assets  performs internal analyses by preparing interest rate shock scenarios representing the effects of specific interest rate changes on its net interest income and capital to its basic one year gap model as a quantitative tool to measure the amount of inb s interest rate risk associated with changing market interest rates 
based on the december  negative one year static gap adjusted for various assumptions  if market rates were assumed to immediately increase by either  or basis points  inb s annualized net interest income would be reduced in each scenario from current levels by an estimated  and  respectively 
it should be noted that for purposes of computing the one year static interest rate sensitivity gap  all of inb s deposits with no stated maturities are treated as readily accessible accounts as noted in footnote to the gap table  which contributes significantly to the liability sensitive position reported per the one year gap 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change 
depositors may not necessarily immediately withdraw funds in the event deposit rates offered by inb did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
for example  if only of deposits with no stated maturity were assumed to be readily accessible  the one year interest rate sensitivity gap would have been a negative at december   compared to a negative at december   which would have resulted in a significantly lower level of perceived interest rate sensitivity when using gap analysis for such measure 
regulatory developments the following are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this report 
in  inb and its primary regulator  the occ  entered into a memorandum of understanding 
inb also agreed to maintain minimum capital ratios at specified levels higher than those otherwise required by applicable regulations 
fdic insurance premium rates have increased substantially in for all insured institutions and they will continue to negatively affect inb s operating results and those of the banking industry 
in february  the frb  ibc s primary regulator  informed ibc that it may not  without the prior approval of the frb  pay dividends on or redeem its capital stock  pay interest on or redeem its trust preferred securities  or incur new debt 
inb has also been informed by it primary regulator  the occ  that it will not be permitted to pay any cash dividends to ibc 
recent accounting standards see note the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this topic 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices our financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
because virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  security investing  deposit taking and borrowing activities 
we do not engage in and accordingly have no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments as of december  and  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital 
to this regard  inb  whose assets represent of total consolidated assets  performs internal analyses by preparing interest rate shock scenarios representing the effects of specific interest rate changes on its net interest income and capital to its basic one year static gap model as a quantitative tool to measure the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market interest rates 
inb also engages an outside consultant to prepare quarterly reports using an earnings simulation model to quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on its projected net interest income and net income over projected periods 
these computations rely on various assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and composition  and the pricing and repricing and maturity characteristics of the balance sheet
