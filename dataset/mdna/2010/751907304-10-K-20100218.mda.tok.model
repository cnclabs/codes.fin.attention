certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  and  as such  are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements for reasons including those risks discussed under part i item a risk factors  elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as will  may  believe  expect  intend  anticipate  could  should  plan  estimate  and potential  or other similar words 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates significant estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to bad debts and sales returns and allowances  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets including goodwill  income taxes  accrued expenses  stock compensation accruals  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  market trends  financial forecasts and projections and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and apply them on a consistent basis 
any factual errors or errors in these estimates and judgments may have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
recognition of revenue 
revenue from product sales to direct customers and distributors is recognized upon shipment as we generally do not have any post shipment obligations or allow for any acceptance provisions 
in the event a situation occurs to create a post shipment obligation  we would defer revenue recognition until the specific obligation was satisfied 
we defer recognition of sales to distributors when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of product returns due to insufficient historical product return information 
the revenue recorded is dependent upon estimates of expected customer returns and sales discounts based upon both historical data and management estimates 
revenue from licensing programs is recognized over the period we are required to provide services under the terms of the agreement 
revenue from research and development activities that are funded by customers is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from royalties is recognized upon the notification to us of shipment of product from our technology license partners to direct customers 
inventory valuation scrap 
we write down our inventory  with a resulting increase in our scrap expense  for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we seek to maintain a stringent credit approval process although our management must make significant judgments in assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
we continue to monitor customers credit worthiness  and use judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which will ultimately not be collected 
in addition  our distributors have a right to return products under certain conditions 
we recognize revenue on shipments to distributors at the time of shipment  along with a reserve for estimated returns based on historical data and future estimates 
deferred income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to estimate our income taxes on a consolidated basis 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment up or down in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
future adjustments could materially affect our financial results as reported in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  among other effects  could cause us not to achieve our projected results 

table of contents in assessing the potential to realize our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
long lived assets 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
under current standards  the assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest 
however  if projected cash flows are less than their carrying value  the long lived assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
there can be no assurance that future long lived asset impairments will not occur 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
during the quarter ended march   we concluded an impairment had occurred and recorded an impairment charge of million 
this assessment required estimates of future revenue  operating results and cash flows  as well as estimates of critical valuation inputs such as discount rates  terminal values and similar data 
share based payment assumptions 
we estimate volatility  forfeitures  and expected term of our options granted based upon historical data 
all of these variables have an effect on the estimated fair value of our share based awards 
results of operations overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets specialized semiconductor memory  microcontroller  and integrated semiconductor solutions  used in many markets for a wide range of applications 
we pioneered the integration of ferroelectric materials into semiconductor products  which enabled the development of a new class of nonvolatile memory  called ferroelectric random access memory f ram 
f ram products merge the advantages of multiple memory technologies into a single device that retains information without a power source  can be read from and written to at very fast speeds  written to many times  consumes low amounts of power  and can simplify the design of electronic systems 
in many cases  we are the sole provider of f ram enabled semiconductor products  which facilitates close customer relationships  long application lifecycles and the potential for higher margin sales 
we also integrate wireless communication capabilities as well as analog and mixed signal functions such as microprocessor supervision  tamper detection  timekeeping  and power failure detection into our devices 
this has enabled a new classes of products that address the growing market need for more functional  efficient and cost effective semiconductor products 
in  we introduced new products  which included stand alone memory  integrated  and custom devices

this was offset in part by a decrease in account payable and accrued liabilities 
the net amount of cash provided by operating activities during was million and was primarily due to the earnings from operations after adjusting for non cash items and an increase in accounts payable

the net amount of cash provided by financing activities during was million 
the primary source of cash was the exercise of stock options and warrants 
this was offset by principal payments on our outstanding debt 
liquidity we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   which included million in our money market account 
our future liquidity depends on revenue growth  steady gross margins and control of operating expenses 
in addition to operating cash flow from product sales  we currently have approximately million available to us under the million secured line of credit facility 
this secured line of credit facility expires on august  as of december   no balance was outstanding on the secured line of credit facility 
we have given extended payment terms to our largest customer 
progress payments have been paid in accordance with such commitment  however  the receivable is not presently fully eligible for the existing borrowing base under the terms of the loan agreement governing our secured line of credit facility 
this could have an adverse effect on the amount of funds we could borrow on the secured line of credit facility  unless that customer s receivables becomes fully eligible to include in our borrowing base 

table of contents at the time we agreed to extend payment terms  we reviewed the criteria for revenue recognition 
based on the following facts  we determined that we were able continue to recognize revenue in accordance with our existing policy 
we have been selling to this customer for over five years 
during the latter half of  we extended their payment terms to net days 
while our standard payment terms are net  we agreed to extended payment terms due to our customer s underlying customer base paying at greater terms 
thus it was in our best interest to work with a loyal customer to assist them with their cash flow 
as part of granting extended payment terms  we have established a thorough monitoring program to ensure that collectability is reasonably assured at the time of sale 
this program includes a weekly review of the customers balance by the controller and staff accountant in charge of accounts receivable 
in addition  we have semi monthly teleconferences between the company s controller and the customer s cfo 
the purpose of the teleconference is to agree on the payment schedule for the following month 
weekly wire payments have been made since january in accordance with the agreed upon plan and the customer has never missed a promised payment 
last  we obtained and reviewed recent financial statements from the non public customer to assess their liquidity and have noted no deterioration in their working capital 
our sales price to our customer is both fixed and determinable with no right of return 
we obtain purchase orders and or confirmation of quotes from this customer that state that the product is both non cancellable and non returnable as the parts are built specifically for this customer 
the manufactured parts are direct sales to our largest customer and are not sold through a distribution channel 
we believe we have sufficient resources to fund current operations through at least the end of we have contracted with ibm to provide us with facility design and fit up  tool installation and tool qualification services in support of ibm s manufacture of our f ram products 
we will provide certain tools  peripheral equipment  technology and specifications for ibm s manufacture of our products 
we will also provide our f ram technology and engineering expertise to ibm to assist in the integration and process development of our f ram products 
expenditures relating to capital and engineering support for our ibm foundry project paid to date are approximately million and we estimate an additional million will be needed over the next year 
engineering wafers and additional capital that we have not committed to could increase the requirements to an additional million 
if we do not generate enough cash from our operations or have sufficient available borrowings under our secured line of credit facility  or if actual expenditures for capital and engineering support for our ibm foundry project are higher than estimated  the ibm foundry project could be delayed and could be at risk of being cancelled 
if net cash flow is not sufficient to meet our cash requirements  we may use the credit facility mentioned above or any other credit facility we may obtain 
we may  however  be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
any issuance of common or preferred stock or convertible securities to obtain additional funding would result in dilution of our existing stockholders interests 
debt instruments on august   we executed an amended and restated loan and security agreement amended loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb 
the amended loan agreement provides for a million working capital line of credit with a million sublimit for exim advances  million sublimit for foreign accounts receivable  and a sublimit of million for letters of credit and foreign exchange exposure and cash management services 
the amended loan agreement replaces the company s amended and restated loan and security agreement dated september  the amended loan agreement provides for interest at a floating rate equal to the svb prime lending rate plus to per annum depending upon cash balances and loan availability maintained at svb 
the term is two years expiring on august   with a commitment fee of  paid at signing and  on the first anniversary 
there is also a 
unused line fee  payable monthly in arrears 
security for the amended loan agreement includes all of our assets except for real estate and leased equipment 
the related borrowing base is comprised of the company s trade receivables 
we plan to draw upon our loan facility for working capital purposes as required 
the net availability under our secured line of credit facility as of december  was million reflecting the million of letters of credit outstanding 
an insufficient amount of funds available under our secured line of credit facility could cause of us to delay or cancel the ibm foundry project 

table of contents we are using equipment leases for the required equipment to support our ibm foundry project 
we have obtained million of lease financing secured by specific equipment with terms averaging months 
additionally  we are currently in the process of obtaining an additional month lease totaling approximately million  which we expect to close during the first quarter of we expect to issue a letter of credit for the benefit of the lessor of approximately million 
on december   we  through our subsidiary  ramtron llc  for which we serve as sole member and sole manager  closed a mortgage loan facility with american national insurance company 
ramtron llc entered into a promissory note evidencing the loan with the principal amount of million  with a maturity date of january   bearing interest at 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding on the mortgage loan facility 
ramtron llc also entered into an agreement for the benefit of american national insurance company granting it a mortgage over real estate as collateral for the mortgage loan facility 
we continue to investigate the benefit of selling our headquarters or leasing a portion of our headquarters that we do not currently use 
legal matters we are party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
although the outcomes of any such legal actions cannot be predicted  our management believes that there are no pending legal proceedings against or involving us for which the outcome would likely have a material adverse effect upon our financial position or results of operations
