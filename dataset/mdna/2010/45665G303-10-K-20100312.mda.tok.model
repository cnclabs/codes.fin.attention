item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled risk factors in part i item a of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview we are a drug discovery and development company that is utilizing our strength in small molecule drug technologies to discover and develop medicines for the treatment of cancer and related conditions 
our discovery program has generated four clinical stage drug candidates spanning programs in the inhibition of heat shock protein  or hsp  chaperone system  the hedgehog signaling pathway and fatty acid amide hydrolase  or faah 
our lead product candidate  ipi retaspimycin hydrochloride  is an intravenously administered small molecule inhibitor of hsp hsp is a central component of the cellular chaperone system a system that supports and stabilizes cancer causing proteins such as egfr and her  enabling multiple forms of cancer to thrive 
inhibition of the hsp chaperone knocks out this critical source of support for cancer cells  leading to tumor growth inhibition and cancer cell death 
thus  hsp chaperone inhibition may represent a significant yet currently unaddressed strategy for treating patients with cancer 
we are evaluating ipi in multiple clinical trials  including an international phase clinical trial of ipi in combination with herceptin trastuzumab in patients with her positive metastatic breast cancer  a phase clinical trial of ipi in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  and a phase clinical trial of ipi in combination with taxotere docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors 
the clinical trials of ipi in combination with herceptin and taxotere are both actively enrolling patients  and we anticipate reporting preliminary data from the herceptin combination study in in may  we presented preliminary data from the nsclc and taxotere combination trials at the american society for clinical oncology  or asco  annual meeting demonstrating a generally well tolerated safety profile in both trials and  in the nsclc trial  anti tumor activity evidenced by a overall response rate 
we expect to report final data from the nsclc trial in we are currently researching genetic biomarkers that could be related to response to ipi in patients with nsclc 
based on the results of this research  we are evaluating options for the further clinical investigation of ipi in patients with nsclc whose tumors express a particular biomarker 
we are also enrolling patients in a phase clinical trial of ipi  an orally delivered inhibitor of hsp  in patients with advanced solid tumors 
this trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of ipi and to identify a dose and schedule for subsequent studies 
we plan to initiate and report data from a phase clinical trial of ipi in patients with advanced hematological  or blood  cancers in in april  we elected to close our international phase registration trial of ipi in patients with refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors  or gist  following the recommendation of our independent data monitoring committee  or idmc 
the idmc s recommendation to close this study followed an early review of safety data that showed a higher than anticipated mortality rate among patients enrolled in the treatment arm 
we have worldwide development and commercialization rights for our hsp chaperone inhibitor program  which includes ipi and ipi  subject to the payment to our former partner  medimmune  inc  an affiliate of astrazeneca plc  of a single digit royalty on net sales of ipi and ipi we refer to medimmune in this report as medimmune az 

table of contents our next most advanced program is directed against the hedgehog signaling pathway  or hedgehog pathway 
the hedgehog pathway is normally active during embryonic development and regulates tissue and organ formation 
malignant activation of the hedgehog pathway is believed to play a central role in allowing the proliferation and survival of cancer cells  including in pancreatic  prostate  small cell lung  breast  blood cancers  as well as certain skin and brain cancers 
the lead candidate in our hedgehog pathway program  ipi  is a novel  orally available inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway that has demonstrated anti tumor activity in numerous preclinical models 
in october  we commenced a phase clinical trial evaluating ipi in patients with advanced and or metastatic solid tumors 
the primary objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipi and to identify a dose and schedule for subsequent studies 
we expect to initiate phase development of ipi in we are pursuing our hedgehog pathway program in collaboration with mundipharma international corporation limited  or mundipharma 
we also have a program directed to faah  an emerging target for neuropathic pain 
the enzyme faah degrades anandamide  which is a neurotransmitter that produces a pain relieving effect in response to pain and nerve injury 
faah inhibition is believed to increase the duration of anandamide s effect  prolonging pain relief at the site of release 
we recently initiated a phase clinical trial of ipi  our novel  orally available inhibitor of faah  and anticipate completing this trial in the objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of ipi we are pursuing our faah program in collaboration with mundipharma and an independent associated company  purdue pharmaceutical products lp  or purdue 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  significant resources to fund the research and development of ipi  ipi  ipi  ipi and our other drug candidates 
while we may have net income in future periods as the result of non recurring collaboration income  as we did in the year ended december   we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years as our clinical trial and drug manufacturing activities for our hsp program increase 
collaboration agreements purdue and mundipharma 
in november  we entered into strategic alliance agreements with each of purdue and mundipharma to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products 
the alliance includes product candidates that inhibit or target the hedgehog pathway and faah  and product candidates arising out of all our discovery projects in all disease fields that achieve development candidate status on or before december  with mundipharma having the right  through the exercise of two consecutive one year options  to extend such period through december  
we refer to such three to five year period as the funded discovery period 
our hsp and bcl programs are expressly excluded from the alliance 
the agreement with purdue is focused on the development and us commercialization of products targeting faah 
the agreement with mundipharma is focused on the development and commercialization outside of the united states of all products and product candidates covered by the alliance  including those targeting faah 
under the strategic alliance agreements  we have responsibility and decision making authority for the performance of early discovery projects and the development of all product candidates on a worldwide basis 
there are no joint steering or similar committees for the alliance 
mundipharma is obligated to pay of our contractually budgeted amounts for research and development expenses incurred by us for early discovery projects and product candidates included in the alliance until the later of december  and the commencement of the first phase clinical trial of such product candidate  which we refer to as the transition date 
the contractually budgeted amount for the period between november  and december  was million and the contractually budgeted amount for the years ended december  and is million and million  respectively 
after the transition date for each product candidate other than those arising out of the faah project  we will share with mundipharma all research and development costs for such product candidate equally 
upon completion of the first phase clinical trial of ipi  purdue and mundipharma may elect to assume responsibility  at their own expense  for the future development of products arising out of the 
table of contents faah project and their sale in and outside of the united states  respectively 
we are recording revenue for reimbursed research and development services we perform for mundipharma and purdue 
we recorded million in such revenue in the year ended december  mundipharma has the right to opt out of any early discovery project or any preclinical or clinical development program on an annual basis in november of each year 
in the event of an opt out decision  mundipharma  together with purdue with respect to the faah project  will continue to provide funding for  in the aggregate  of our contractually budgeted research and development expenses for the applicable project or program for one year after the date of such opt out 
purdue has a comparable opt out right with respect to the faah project 
in addition to the annual opt out right  mundipharma and purdue will each have the right to opt out of participation in the faah project following completion of the first phase clinical trial of ipi if mundipharma and purdue were to exercise this right  there is no residual funding obligation for the faah project  but we may redeploy contractually budgeted amounts that had been allocated to the faah project to any other project that is the subject of the alliance 
in addition  we and mundipharma each have the right to opt out of continued development of a product candidate after it has reached the transition date  with a one year tail funding obligation for its of post transition date research and development expenses 
if a party exercises its right to opt out of the development of a product or product candidate after the transition date  the other party may elect to continue the development and assume responsibility for the worldwide commercialization of such product or product candidate  subject to the payment of a royalty 
except as set forth above with respect to faah products and opt out products  we will have the right and responsibility to market and sell products arising from the research program in the united states and mundipharma will have the right and responsibility to market and sell products arising from the research program outside of the united states 
other than pursuant to the strategic alliance agreements  neither we  purdue nor mundipharma may develop  manufacture or commercialize products that arise out of the research program or products that are directed to the same target or pathway as a product included in the research program  unless and until a party terminates its rights with respect to such products 
if we in license any product or product candidate during the funded discovery period for which commercialization rights outside of the united states are available for grant by us to mundipharma  mundipharma will have the option to include such in licensed product or product candidate in the alliance by paying us a prescribed percentage of the up front license fee or other acquisition cost  which percentage could be up to of such fee or cost  in order for mundipharma to obtain commercialization rights for such in licensed product or product candidate in all countries outside of the united states  and by funding research and development costs in the same manner as products or product candidates arising out of our internal discovery programs 
the agreement with mundipharma provides for the agreed upon research and development budgets to be updated to reflect the inclusion of any in licensed products or product candidates 
there will be no royalties paid between the parties on in licensed candidates 
except with respect to products that have been in licensed by us  for which no royalties will be payable between the parties  we are obligated to pay mundipharma a royalty on net sales of the commercialized products until such time as mundipharma has recovered all research and development expenses paid to us under the research program prior to the applicable transition date 
after such cost recovery  we are obligated to pay a tiered  to royalty on us net sales of those products 
for products in which mundipharma has opted out of development prior to the transition date  we are obligated to pay royalties of to of worldwide net sales as a function of the stage of development of the applicable product candidate at the time of opt out 
for products in which either party has opted out of development following the transition date  the commercializing party is obligated to pay the other party a royalty on net sales 
mundipharma is obligated to pay us a tiered  to royalty on annual net sales outside of the united states of each product arising out of the alliance  and purdue is obligated to pay us a tiered  to royalty on annual net sales of faah products in the united states 
royalties are payable until the later to occur of the last to expire of specified patent rights and the expiration of non patent regulatory exclusivities in a country  provided that if royalties are payable solely on the 
table of contents basis of non patent regulatory exclusivity  each of the rates above is reduced by one half 
in addition  all royalties payable under the strategic alliance agreements  whether by us  purdue or mundipharma  are subject to reduction on account of third party royalty payments or patent litigation damages or settlements  with any such reductions capped at of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period 
each of the strategic alliance agreements expire when the parties thereto have no further obligations to each other thereunder 
either party may terminate the strategic alliance agreement to which it is a party on days prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the day notice period 
the agreements may also be terminated by purdue or mundipharma in the event of a change in control of infinity or in the event that  during the funded research period  i julian adams is no longer a full time executive of infinity  or ii both steven h 
holtzman and adelene q 
perkins are no longer full time executives of infinity 
upon termination of either strategic alliance agreement by us or either purdue or mundipharma  either party to the other strategic alliance agreement may terminate that agreement 
in connection with the entry into the strategic alliance agreements  we also entered into a securities purchase agreement and line of credit agreement with purdue and its independent associated company  purdue pharma lp  or pplp 
in march  purdue assigned its interest under the line of credit agreement to pplp 
under the securities purchase agreement we issued and sold in a first equity closing in november an aggregate of four million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
of such shares  two million shares of our common stock were purchased by each purchaser 
in january  we conducted a second equity closing where we issued and sold an aggregate of two million shares of our common stock  and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of six million shares of our common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
of the second closing securities  an equal number were purchased by each purchaser 
in  we recorded million as deferred revenue associated with the grant of licenses to mundipharma and purdue 
this amount represented the excess of the amount paid by purdue and pplp for our common stock per share over the closing market price on the day before the first equity closing per share 
in  we considered our obligation  absent material adverse changes  to issue purdue and pplp the second closing securities to be a forward contract with immaterial intrinsic value  which was recorded in stockholders equity 
this forward contract closed in january upon the issuance of the second closing securities 
in january  we recorded million as deferred revenue associated with the grant of licenses to mundipharma and purdue  representing the excess of the million paid by purdue and pplp for the second closing securities over the fair market value of these securities per share for the common stock and approximately million for the warrants as of the day before the first equity closing 
all deferred revenue related to the strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue will be recognized as revenue ratably over years  which is our estimated period of performance under the arrangement 
we will periodically review this estimate and make adjustments as facts and circumstances dictate 
we recognized million in such revenue in the year ended december  the line of credit agreement provides for the borrowing by us of one or more unsecured loans up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of million 
the loans may be drawn by us during the three year period beginning on april  the loans  which may be used by us for any proper corporate purpose  mature on april   which we refer to as the maturity date  and will be subordinate to any senior indebtedness that we may incur 
borrowings made under the line of credit agreement will bear interest  payable on the maturity date  at a fluctuating rate set at the prime rate on the business day prior to the funding of each loan and will be reset on the last business day of each month ending thereafter 
interest will be compounded on each successive three month anniversary of the funding of each loan 
outstanding loans may be prepaid without penalty or premium prior to the maturity date 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement  once borrowed  may not be borrowed again 
we have certain rights to repay outstanding amounts under the line of credit agreement in shares of our common stock 

table of contents the extension of the line of credit at an interest rate below our incremental borrowing rate represents the transfer of additional value to us in the arrangement 
as such  we recorded the fair value of the line of credit of million as a loan commitment asset on our balance sheet in we began amortizing this asset to interest expense over the life of the loan arrangement  or years  on april  because purdue and its associated companies became significant related parties as a result of the equity issuances  we recorded the offset to this asset as additional paid in capital in as of december   no amounts have been borrowed under this line of credit 
medimmune az 
in august  we entered into a product development and commercialization agreement with medimmune az to jointly develop and commercialize cancer drugs targeting hsp and the hedgehog pathway 
in november  we regained from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights under our hedgehog pathway program and in december  we reacquired from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights to our hsp chaperone inhibitor program 
under the terms of this agreement  we shared equally with medimmune az all development costs  as well as potential profits and losses  from any future marketed products 
medimmune az made non refundable  up front payments totaling million to us in order to obtain co exclusive rights to the hsp and hedgehog pathway development programs  and paid a million milestone to us in upon initiation of the phase clinical trial of ipi in patients with gist that we elected to close in april upon the reacquisition of rights to the hsp chaperone inhibitor program  we recognized all of the remaining deferred revenue related to the up front license fee from medimmune az  as we had no further performance obligations to medimmune az 
following the reacquisition of the hsp chaperone inhibitor program in december  medimmune az remained obligated to fund an amount equivalent to its share of hsp program costs for the ensuing six month period  and we recorded these reimbursable amounts from the reacquisition date through december  as income from residual funding  a component of other income in our statement of operations 
in january  however  we agreed with medimmune az to settle the residual funding obligation remaining for through lump sum payments totaling million  which were recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program in our statement of operations 
the profit and cost sharing provisions of our arrangement with medimmune az are no longer applicable  and we have full control over all future development and commercialization activities under our hsp and hedgehog pathway programs  subject to the payment of single digit royalties to medimmune az on worldwide net sales  if any  of each of ipi and ipi we do not have a royalty obligation to medimmune az on any future sales of ipi novartis 
in february  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis institute for biomedical research  inc  or novartis  to discover  develop and commercialize drugs targeting bcl protein family members for the treatment of a broad range of cancers 
under the terms of this agreement  we granted to novartis an exclusive  worldwide license to research  develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products that are based upon our proprietary bcl inhibitors 
novartis paid us a million up front license fee  which we originally recognized over an estimated period of performance of four years  an affiliate of novartis made a million equity investment in us  and novartis committed to provide us research funding of approximately million over the initial two year research term  which expired in february novartis had the right to extend the research term for up to two additional one year terms  under which novartis could have obligated us to provide up to five full time equivalents  at novartis expense  to enable the full transition of the bcl inhibitor program to novartis 
novartis chose not to exercise its right for the one year extensions  thus  the research term ended in february because we have no further performance obligations to novartis  we recognized the remaining balance of deferred revenue of million of the up front license fee as revenue in the three months ended march  we may request to participate in clinical development of any products arising from this collaboration and  if such request is agreed upon by novartis  novartis will fund agreed upon development costs that are incurred by us 
we also have a non exclusive right to detail bcl family inhibitor products in the united states  with our detailing costs to be reimbursed by novartis 
novartis has agreed to make milestone payments 
table of contents totaling over million if certain specified research  development and commercialization milestones are achieved for multiple products for multiple indications  such that total payments to us could exceed million 
novartis has also agreed to pay us royalties upon successful commercialization of any products developed under the alliance 
financial overview revenue all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  the reimbursement of research and development costs  contract service revenue and milestones payments received from our collaboration partners 
where the agreement with a collaboration partner provides for the partner to provide research funding for our research and development efforts  as is the case in our agreements with mundipharma and purdue  and as was the case in our agreement with novartis  we recognize this cost reimbursement as revenue in the period earned 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales  research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  research and development reimbursement  milestone and other payments earned under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments that we earn upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
if we fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  would be materially adversely affected 
research and development expense we are a drug discovery and development company that has focused its efforts in the field of cancer and related conditions 
our research and development expense primarily consists of the following compensation of personnel associated with research activities  including consultants  clinical testing costs  including payments made to contract research organizations  laboratory supplies and materials  manufacturing drug candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies  preclinical testing costs  including costs of toxicology studies  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  depreciation of equipment  and allocated costs of facilities 
under our collaboration with medimmune az  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune az 
in december  we reacquired from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights to our hsp chaperone inhibitor program 
amounts reimbursed by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of the parties collaboration agreement incurred prior to our reacquisition of the hsp chaperone inhibitor program were recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in our statements of operations 
amounts reimbursed by medimmune az incurred following the reacquisition of the hsp chaperone inhibitor program were recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program in our statements of operations 
this cost sharing arrangement also applied to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program through may  
table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology infrastructure  corporate communications and human resources functions 
other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  professional fees for legal and accounting services and early commercial development costs 
general and administrative expense also consists of the costs of maintaining our intellectual property portfolio 
other income and expense interest expense and other interest and investment income typically consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  net of interest expense  and amortization of warrants 
interest expense includes amortization of the loan commitment asset from pplp 
reimbursable amounts from medimmune az incurred following the reacquisition of the hsp program in december are recorded as income from residual funding  which is included in other income and expense 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  assumptions in the valuation of stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition to date  all of our revenue has been generated under research collaboration agreements 
the terms of these research collaboration agreements may include payment to us of non refundable  up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved  and or royalties on product sales 
we divide agreements containing multiple elements into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborative partner and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
for these agreements  we allocate the consideration that we receive among the separate units based on their respective fair values or  in some cases  the residual method  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the research or development term 
we recognize research and development funding as earned over the period of effort as related research costs are incurred 
we regularly consider whether events warrant a change in the estimated period of performance under an agreement 
such a change would cause us to modify the period of time over which we recognize revenue on a prospective basis from the up front license fees paid to us under that agreement and would  in turn  result in changes in our quarterly and annual results 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
table of contents and the milestone is at risk for both parties 
if any of these conditions is not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the remaining estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
we will recognize royalty revenue  if any  based upon actual and estimated net sales by the licensee of licensed products in licensed territories  and in the period the sales occur 
we have not recognized any royalty revenue to date 
we exercise our judgment in determining whether an agreement contains multiple elements and  if so  how much revenue is allocable to each element 
in addition  we exercise our judgment in determining when our significant obligations have been met under such agreements and the specific time periods over which we recognize revenue  such as non refundable  up front license fees 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition with respect to such transactions would change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported operating results 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
we have entered into certain collaboration agreements in which expenses are shared with the collaborator  and others in which we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of the collaborator 
we record all of these expenses as research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator  we record payments from the collaborator for its share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we make payments to the collaborator  we record our payments to the collaborator for its share of the development effort as additional research and development expense 
if the arrangement provides for reimbursement of research and development expenses  we record the reimbursement as revenue 
our collaboration with medimmune az was a cost sharing arrangement  our alliance with mundipharma and purdue provides for  and our collaboration with novartis provided for  the reimbursement of our research and development expenses 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with pharmaceutical development work and to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials and preclinical studies 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers  or if we over or under estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
we often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
our estimates of expenses in future periods may be over or under accrued 
stock based compensation we expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity compensation 
we use our judgment in determining the fair value of our equity instruments  including in selecting the inputs we use for the black scholes valuation model 
equity instrument valuation models are by their nature highly subjective 
any 
table of contents significant changes in any of our judgments  including those used to select the inputs for the black scholes valuation model  could have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity instruments granted and the associated compensation charge we record in our financial statements 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss carryforwards  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rate is recognized in income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date 
we use our judgment for the recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we will recognize any material interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
fair value measurements we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we determine fair value based on the assumptions market participants use when pricing the asset or liability 
we also use the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop these assumptions 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu no 
 which amends the existing fair value measurements and disclosures guidance currently included in accounting standards codification no 
to require additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
specifically  asu no 
requires entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers  the reasons for any transfer in or out of level  and information in the reconciliation of recurring level measurements about purchases  sales  issuance and settlements on a gross basis 
in addition  asu no 
also clarifies the requirement for entities to disclose information about both the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for additional disclosures related to level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect asu no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 multiple element revenue arrangements asu no 
 which updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included in accounting standards codification no 
in two ways 
the first change relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this is significant as it will likely result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
asu no 
also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple element revenue arrangements 
asu no 
will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
we are currently evaluating the effect of asu no 
and are unable to quantify the impact on our consolidated financial statements or determine the timing and method of its adoption 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended december   and  in thousands  together with the change in each item as a percentage 
change change revenue research and development expense general and administrative expense interest expense interest and investment income income from settlement with nih income from residual funding of hsp program income tax benefit revenue our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance entered into with mundipharma and purdue in november  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million associated with the amortization and acceleration of the up front license fee received from medimmune az upon entry into our strategic alliance  million related to a milestone payment from medimmune az upon initiation of our phase trial of ipi in patients with gist  million related to the amortization and acceleration of the non refundable license fee  and million related to the reimbursable research and development services we performed  under our bcl collaboration with novartis  and million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliances entered into with mundipharma and purdue in november our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million associated with the amortization of the up front license fee received from medimmune az upon entry into our strategic alliance in august  million related to the amortization of the non refundable license fee  and million related to the reimbursable research and development services we performed  under our bcl collaboration entered into with novartis in february  and million related to the acceptance of compounds by novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
under our technology access agreement 
we currently expect that all of our revenue in will be derived from reimbursed research and development services and amortization of deferred revenue under our alliance with purdue and mundipharma 
research and development expense research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   and of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  
table of contents the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a decrease of million in amounts reimbursed by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement  an increase of million in pharmaceutical development expenses as our hsp and hedgehog programs have advanced  an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation  for our research and development personnel  which was primarily driven by the hiring of new research and development personnel and annual base salary increases  and partially offset by a decrease in accrued amounts under our contingent cash compensation program  an increase of million in consulting expenses primarily related to the clinical development of ipi  and an increase of million in preclinical expenses as our faah program has advanced 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in expenses for clinical trials of ipi  ipi and ipi  an increase of million in pharmaceutical development expenses as our hsp and hedgehog programs advanced  and an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation  for our research and development personnel  which was primarily driven by the hiring of new research and development personnel  our contingent cash compensation program and annual base salary increases 
this million increase in research and development expenditures was partially offset by an increase of million in amounts reimbursed by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement 
the following table sets forth our estimates of research and development expenses  by program  over the last three years 
these expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs  process development and manufacturing  preclinical toxicology studies  clinical trial costs and allocated costs of facilities 
our hsp program and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs were being conducted in collaboration with medimmune az 
we reacquired all development and worldwide commercialization rights to our hsp program and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs in december and november  respectively 
under this collaboration  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune az 
pursuant to our cost sharing agreement  reimbursable amounts from medimmune az were credited to research and development expenses for our hsp program through december  and for our hedgehog pathway inhibitors program through may  the expenses for the hsp chaperone inhibitor and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs include credits of approximately million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  program year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  hsp chaperone inhibitors million million million hedgehog pathway inhibitors million million million faah inhibitors million bcl million million we do not believe that the historical costs associated with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs or represent what any other future drug development 
table of contents program we initiate may cost 
due to the variability in the length of time and scope of activities necessary to develop a drug candidate  uncertainties related to cost estimates and our ability to obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total costs required to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
we are conducting multiple studies of our hsp chaperone inhibitors  ipi and ipi these studies are focused on establishing a dose and schedule of administration that optimizes safety and efficacy of these candidates  and identifying patient populations most likely to benefit from hsp inhibition 
if we are unable to establish the optimal dose and schedule for either ipi or ipi during  we may elect to discontinue further development of the applicable drug candidate 
we expect expenses for our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program to increase as we make progress in the clinical development of ipi in addition  we expect expenses for our faah program to increase as we commence clinical development of ipi we do not expect to incur any future research and development expenses for the bcl program because our research obligations under our collaboration with novartis ended in february general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which was primarily driven by the hiring of new general and administrative personnel  and annual base salary increases  and partially offset by a decrease in accrued amounts under our contingent cash compensation program  and an increase of million in consulting expenses  principally related to early commercial development and public relations services 
the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which was primarily driven by the hiring of new general and administrative personnel  accrued amounts under our contingent cash compensation program and annual base salary increases  and an increase of million in consulting expenses  principally related to early commercial development and public relations services 
we expect our general and administrative expense to increase in in support of our research and development initiatives and as we begin to establish commercial capabilities 
interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and as a result of amortizing the loan commitment asset from purdue 
interest and investment income interest and investment income decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the lower yields on our cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we expect interest and investment income to continue to be lower in as compared to due to lower expected yields and lower average balances 

table of contents interest and investment income decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower yields on our available for sale securities and cash equivalents and the lower quarterly average balance of available for sale securities and cash equivalents due to our cash burn and the timing of cash receipts during the year 
income from nih reimbursement during the year ended december   we received million from the national institutes of health related to contract work performed by discovery partners international  inc from august through june we do not expect any such income in future periods 
income from residual funding of hsp program following our reacquisition of the hsp program in december  medimmune az remained obligated to fund an amount equivalent to its share of the hsp program costs for the ensuing six month period 
reimbursable amounts from the date of reacquisition december  to december  were recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program 
in january  we agreed with medimmune az to settle the residual funding obligations through lump sum payments totaling million  which we also recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program in the year ended december  income tax benefit we realized an income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of this law contains a provision that permits companies to carry back certain or net operating losses for a period of up to five years and receive a benefit for prior tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources we have not generated any revenue from the sale of drugs to date  and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the next several years  if at all 
we have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities  interest on investments  license fees  expense reimbursement under our collaborations  milestone payments  contract service payments and debt to fund our operations 
our available for sale debt securities primarily trade in liquid markets  and the average days to maturity of our portfolio as of december  is less than six months 
because our product candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain  we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether  or when  we may achieve profitability 
other significant capital resources are as follows december  december  cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities including long term working capital years ended december  cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above financing activities 
table of contents cash flows the principal use of cash in operating activities in all of the periods presented was the funding of our research and development expenses  which increase as our drug development programs advance 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable  as well as changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
in november  we entered into strategic alliances with mundipharma and purdue and issued four million shares of our common stock to purdue and one of its independent associated companies for cash proceeds of million 
of this amount  these shares were recorded at million  which represents the fair market value of our issued common stock and recorded in our cash flows from financing activities and million was accounted for as an up front license fee in deferred revenue and recorded in our cash flows from operating activities 
during january  we issued to mundipharma and purdue an aggregate of two million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to six million shares of our common stock for cash proceeds of million 
these securities were recorded at their fair value of million and reflected as cash flows from financing activities 
the balance of million was accounted for as an up front license fee in deferred revenue and recorded in our cash flows from operating activities 
during the year ended december   we collected all of our unbilled receivables from purdue  mundipharma and medimmune az 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million in purchases of available for sale securities  proceeds of million from maturities of available for sale securities and proceeds of million from sales of available for sale securities 
capital expenditures in the year ended december  of million primarily consisted of laboratory equipment  software and computer equipment 
our reacquisition of the hsp program from medimmune az in december resulted in a million decrease in deferred revenue 
in february  novartis chose not to exercise its options for two one year extensions of the research period under our bcl collaboration  resulting in an million decrease in deferred revenue 
in january  we received million from medimmune az  representing the second half of the up front license fee related to our collaboration agreement  which was recorded as an unbilled receivable as of december  we will need substantial additional funds to support our planned operations 
in the absence of additional funding or business development activities and based on our current operating plans  we expect that our current cash and investments  together with research and development funding from purdue and mundipharma and the million line of credit that has been made available to us by pplp  are sufficient to fund our planned operations into we may  however  need to raise additional funds before that date if our research and development expenses exceed our current expectations  if we do not receive the payments we expect to receive from mundipharma and purdue  if we acquire a third party or if we acquire or license rights to additional drug candidates or new technologies from one or more third parties 
we may need to raise additional funds for other reasons  including our drug candidates require more extensive clinical or preclinical testing than we currently expect  we advance more of our drug candidates than expected into costly later stage clinical trials  we advance more preclinical drug candidates than expected into early stage clinical trials  the cost of acquiring raw materials for  and of manufacturing  our drug candidates is higher than anticipated  we are required  or consider it advisable  to acquire or license intellectual property rights from one or more third parties  
table of contents mundipharma or purdue elects to discontinue its participation in a partnered program  or we experience a loss in our investments due to general market conditions or other reasons 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings of equity or debt securities  but such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly in light of current market conditions 
in addition  the terms of our financings may be dilutive to  or otherwise adversely affect  holders of our common stock  and such terms may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or incur additional debt 
we may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties  or through project financing 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our product development programs 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond capital lease  including interest software contract obligation operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above  long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling approximately million at december  are not included in the contractual obligations table because  due to their nature  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are in money market funds  corporate obligations  and us government sponsored enterprise obligations 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december   as compared to an approximate  decrease as of december  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments
