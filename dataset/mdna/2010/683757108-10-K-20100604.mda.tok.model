item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview opnet technologies  inc is a provider of software products and related services for managing applications and networks 
our software products and related services address application performance management  network operations  capacity management  and network research and development 
our customers include corporate enterprises  government and defense agencies  network service providers  and network equipment manufacturers 
our software products and related services are designed to help our customers make better use of resources  reduce operational problems and improve competitiveness 
we operate in one reportable industry segment  the development and sale of computer software programs and related services 
our operations are principally in the united states  and we have subsidiaries in belgium  france  germany  the united kingdom and singapore 
we primarily depend upon our direct sales force to generate revenue in the united states 
sales outside the united states are made through our international sales team as well as third party distributors and value added resellers  who generally are responsible for providing technical support and service to customers within their territory 
our revenue is derived from three primary sources product  product updates  technical support and services  and professional services  which include consulting and training services for customers without current maintenance agreements 
product revenue represents all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software and fees associated with hardware necessary to run our software  and excludes revenue derived from product updates  which are included in product updates  technical support  and services revenue 
our software master license agreement provides our customers with the right to use our software either perpetually  which we refer to as perpetual licenses  or during a defined term  generally for one to four years  which we refer to as term licenses 
for the years ended march    and  perpetual licenses represented approximately   and of product revenue  respectively 
substantially all of our product arrangements include both product licenses and product updates  technical support  and services 
product updates  technical support  and services revenue represent fees associated with the sale of unspecified product updates  technical support and when and if available training under our maintenance agreements 
we offer professional services  under both time and material and fixed price agreements  primarily to facilitate the adoption of our software products 
we consider our consulting services to be an integral part of our business model as they are centered on our software product offerings 
because our consulting services facilitate the adoption of our software product offerings  we believe that they ultimately generate additional sales of product licenses 
the key strategies of our business plan include increasing sales to existing customers  increasing deal size by selling modules and introducing new software products  improving our sales and marketing execution  establishing alliances to extend our market reach  increasing our international presence and increasing profitability 
we have focused our sales  marketing  and other efforts on corporate enterprise and united states government opportunities  and to a much lesser extent  service provider and network equipment manufacturer opportunities 
our focus and strategies are designed to increase revenue and profitability 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of revenue growth  we expect to need to closely control the increases in our total expenses as we implement these strategies 

table of contents in march  we launched an initiative to extend our market reach by establishing sales alliances with third parties called the synergy program 
the synergy program is designed to increase the penetration of our software products into mid sized organizations 
the synergy program s focus is on selling our application performance management software products  including ace live that provides end user experience monitoring and real time application performance analytics  as we believe these software products are particularly well suited for channel distribution 
summary of our fiscal financial performance during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  we generated an increase in total revenue  which allowed us to grow income from operations and net income 
the increase in total revenue was primarily the result of growth in sales of our application performance management products to united states government and corporate enterprise customers 
we believe the increase in sales of our application performance management products is the result of competitive advantages offered by our products  together with loosening customer budgets and more normal purchasing patterns as compared to fiscal during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  we also generated an increase in deferred revenue and cash flows from operations 
the increase in deferred revenue was largely the result of growth in the renewal of customer maintenance contracts 
the increase in cash flows from operations was largely the result of growth in sales of our products and maintenance contracts together with strong collections activity during fiscal the following table summarizes information on some of our key financial and operating metrics 
fiscal fiscal amount change percentage change dollars in thousands  except per share data financial data total revenue total cost of revenue gross profit gross profit as a percentage of total revenue gross margin total operating expenses income from operations income from operations as a percentage of total revenue operating margin net income diluted net income per common share other operations data total employees period end total average employees total consultants period end total period end quota carrying sales persons excluding directors and inside sales representatives financial condition and liquidity data cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities period end cash flows from operating activities total deferred revenue period end we achieved growth in product revenue and product updates  technical support and services revenue  offset by a decrease in professional services revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal product revenue increased by million  and product updates  technical support and services revenue increased by million  
table of contents which was offset in part by a decrease in professional services revenue of million 
the increase in product revenue was the result of growth in sales to united states government and corporate enterprise customers  which was partially offset by a decline in sales to service providers and network equipment manufacturers 
the increase in revenue from product updates  technical support and services revenue reflects growth in the overall customer installed base 
increases in the overall customer installed base increase the demand for annual renewals of maintenance contracts 
the sequential decrease in revenue from professional services was largely the result of a decrease in billable hours worked on projects for corporate enterprise customers and service providers 
we believe the decrease in billable hours worked was related to the increase in the proportion of sales of our application performance management products as compared to our other products  as our application performance management products generally require less consulting services to implement 
total revenue generated from sales to united states government customers increased by million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the percentage of total revenue from united states government customers increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the percentage of revenue from united states government customers was due to an increase in sales of our application performance management products 
our international revenue increased to million  or of total revenue  for fiscal we expect revenue from sales outside the united states to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
the increase in international revenue was primarily the result of growth in sales of our application performance management products to corporate enterprise customers 
international revenue in fiscal also benefited from a more experienced direct sales force and our increased focus on sales to corporate enterprises 
sales to corporate enterprises accounted for the largest portion of our international revenue during fiscal we believe that continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our sales  marketing and customer service functions in international markets 
during fiscal  gross profit increased to million 
our gross margin increased slightly to for fiscal from in fiscal the increase in our gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to an increase in product updates  technical support and services revenue of million in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  an increase in product revenue of million 
the increases in revenue were partially offset by an increase in the cost of product revenue of million which primarily resulted from growth in the demand for our hardware based ace live solutions 
during fiscal  operating income increased to million from million during fiscal the increase in operating income was largely the result of an increase in revenue from product updates  technical support and services revenue and product revenue  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
trends that may affect our business and future results while we anticipate a challenging economic environment in the near term  we believe the competitive advantages offered by our products have positioned us well to grow market share and drive profitability as economic conditions improve 
the demand for our software products and related services by corporate enterprise and united states government customers has been much stronger than the demand from service providers and network equipment manufacturers  which is consistent with our expectations 
we believe that lower business activity with service providers and network equipment manufacturers is primarily due to the weakened economy in which these businesses operate  which we expect to continue  at least in the near term 
consequently  our revenue growth and profitability depend  in significant part  upon our ability to sell in a weakened economic environment and the economic health of corporate enterprises and united states government agencies 
we anticipate the following trends and patterns over the next several quarters total revenue 
we believe the current economic environment is showing signs of improvement  but our ability to generate increased revenue domestically and internationally will depend upon continued and sustained improvement in economic conditions 
we expect future growth opportunities in product revenue and product updates  technical support and services revenue to come from sales to corporate enterprise customers and the 
table of contents united states government  as we believe our products offer competitive advantages in these markets 
we expect product revenue and product updates  technical support and services revenue from sales to service providers and network equipment manufacturers to fluctuate from quarter to quarter with the potential for periods of declining revenue 
our ability to increase professional services revenue will depend upon our ability to maintain several large consulting contracts with the united states government and to attract and retain additional qualified consultants  including those with security clearances 
we believe that continued increases in the proportion of sales of our application performance management products  as compared to our other products  will cause the percentage of our total revenue attributable to professional services revenue to decline  and might also cause an absolute decline in professional services revenue  since our application performance management products generally require less consulting time to implement 
as a result of these factors  we believe that we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue 
gross profit margin 
our overall gross profit margin will continue to be affected by the percentage of total revenue generated from product revenue and product updates  technical support and services revenue  as revenue from these sources have substantially higher gross margins than the gross margin on revenue from professional services 
our overall gross profit margin will also be affected by the profitability of individual consulting engagements 
amortization of technology associated with the purchase and or acquisition of technology we may make in future periods may also affect our gross profit margin 
research and development expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development will be required to maintain our competitive position and broaden our software product lines  as well as enhance the features and functionality of our current software products  especially our application performance management products 
we believe that more investment in research and development will be required in order to maintain our competitive position and grow sales of our application performance management products as compared to our other products  as we believe there is more competition in the markets served by these products as compared to the markets for our other products 
we made personnel investments in research and development during fiscal  and we plan to continue making modest investments in additional personnel during the next several quarters 
we expect that the absolute dollar amount of these expenses will continue to grow but generally decrease modestly as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
our ability to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenue will depend upon increases in our revenue  among other factors 
sales and marketing expenses 
we depend upon our direct sales model to generate revenue and believe that increasing the size of our quota carrying sales team is essential for long term growth 
during fiscal  we focused on improving the productivity of our sales force  and only made modest investments in additional direct sales personnel 
we plan to continue this approach during the next several quarters 
we anticipate increases in marketing expenditures during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of our plans to reinstate opnetwork 
we did not hold opnetwork during fiscal due to travel restrictions many companies had in place as a result of economic conditions 
we also plan to increase expenditures in areas we believe will enhance the visibility of our products in the marketplace  especially our application performance management products 
while we expect that the absolute dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal  our ability to lower these expenses as a percentage of revenue will depend upon increases in our revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
we expect the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to expand our operations but generally decrease as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
our ability to decrease these expenses as a percentage of revenue will depend upon increases in our revenue  among other factors 
operating margin 
since a significant portion of our product arrangements close in the latter part of each quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in the short term to respond to lower than expected revenue  which would adversely impact our operating margin and earnings 
our operating margin increased to during fiscal from during fiscal we remain committed to increasing profitability and generating long term growth 
as the economy improves  we plan to strategically increase research and 
table of contents development and marketing expenditures in order to maintain our products competitive advantages and increase market share 
while we intend to strategically increase expenditures in certain areas  we intend to closely monitor and control overall operating expenses in order to maximize our operating margin 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates made by management with respect to these and other items that require management s estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred revenue  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill  software development costs  and income taxes 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from three primary sources products  product updates  technical support and services  which include product updates  certain training provided and offered on a when and if available basis to customers  and technical support  and professional services  which include consulting and custom training services for customers without a current maintenance agreement 
we recognize revenue based on the provisions of accounting standards codification revenue recognition software  or asc product revenue product revenue represents all fees earned from granting customers perpetual and term licenses to use our software as well as the hardware that we use to deliver our ace live software products 
it excludes revenue derived from product updates  which are included in product updates  technical support and services revenue 
for the years ended march    and  perpetual licenses represented approximately   and of product revenue  respectively 
product revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the product has occurred  iii the product fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we analyze each of these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for license arrangements with end users  it is our customary practice to have a written software license agreement  which is signed by both the end user and us  and a purchase order or equivalent 
a written contract can be executed based on the customer specific format or on the standard shrink wrap software master license agreement 
for those end users who have previously negotiated a software license agreement with us  the initial software license agreement is used as evidence of a written contract 
sales to distributors  resellers  and value added resellers  which we collectively refer to as resellers  are primarily made outside of north america and are evidenced by a master reseller agreement governing the relationship  which is signed by both the reseller and us  together with a purchase order on a transaction by transaction basis 
to further evidence an arrangement  our master reseller agreement requires that the reseller provide us copies of the end user s executed software master license agreements 

table of contents delivery has occurred 
physical delivery of our software products to end users or resellers  which are collectively referred to as customers  is generally considered to have occurred upon the transfer of media containing our software products to a common carrier  usually fob shipping point based on standard agreement terms 
software licenses may also be delivered electronically to end users 
electronic delivery is deemed to occur after end users have been provided with access codes that allow them to take immediate possession of the software 
if a software arrangement includes undelivered software products or services that are essential to the functionality of delivered software products  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these software products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
it is our policy to not provide customers the right to any adjustments or refund of any portion of their license fees paid  acceptance provisions  cancellation privileges  or rights of return 
our normal payment terms for our software products and services currently range from net days to net days and primarily vary based on the country in which an agreement is executed 
payments that extend beyond our normal payment terms from the contract date but that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond six months are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenue from such arrangements is recognized as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customer s ability to pay 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
in instances when any of the four criteria are not met  we defer recognition of product revenue until the criteria are met 
when the sale of the software product requires us to make significant enhancements  customization or modifications to the software that are essential to its functionality  product revenue and consulting fees are recognized using contract accounting under asc  revenue recognition construction type and production 
we estimate the percentage of completion  under asc  based on our estimate of total hours to complete the project as a percentage of total hours incurred and the estimated hours to complete 
the process of estimation inherent in the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue is subject to judgments and uncertainties and may affect the amounts of product revenue and professional services revenue under certain contracts and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates to complete client engagements  including skill level and experience of project managers  staff assigned to engagements and continuity and attrition level of professional services staff 
changes in the estimated stage of completion of a particular project could create variability in our revenue and results of operations if it is required to increase or decrease previously recognized revenue related to a particular project or if it expects to incur a loss on the project 
all fees billed to clients for shipping and handling are classified as product revenue 
all costs associated with shipping and handling are classified as cost of product revenue 
product updates  technical support and services revenue product updates  technical support and services revenue represents fees associated with the sale of product updates  training  and technical support  all except technical support provided on a when and if available basis under our maintenance agreement 
payments for product updates  technical support and services on initial order or on renewal are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable 
product updates consist of the right to unspecified software updates on a when and if available basis and are typically entered into in connection with the initial product purchase 
product updates  technical support and services may be renewed upon expiration of the term 
customers can purchase product updates separately from technical support and services 
revenue from product updates  technical support and services is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement 

table of contents we allocate revenue under multiple element arrangements  which typically include product  consulting services  training and maintenance agreements sold together  to each element in the arrangement primarily using the residual method based upon the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we apply discounts  if any  to the delivered elements  usually product  under the residual method 
for periodic unspecified product updates and technical support agreements  vsoe is based upon either the renewal rate specified in each contract or the price charged when sold separately 
for consulting services and training for customers without a current maintenance agreement  vsoe is based upon the rates charged for these services when sold separately 
if we are unable to establish vsoe for an undelivered post contract support  or pcs  element  for example  in a two year term license where the license term and pcs are coterminous and no pcs renewal period exists  all revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
for income statement classification purposes  our allocation methodology is based on vsoe of fair value for our professional services which is determined by the price charged when sold separately  and the contractually stated renewal rates for our pcs  generally to of the license fee paid on perpetual licenses 
we use the residual method to allocate any remaining arrangement fee to product revenue 
professional services revenue professional services revenue consists of fees from consulting services and training for customers without a current maintenance agreement and is recognized as the services are performed 
when we enter into consulting service arrangements that include significant modifications to the software that are essential to the customer s use and the arrangement is bundled with software  we recognize revenue under the entire arrangement under the percentage of completion method 
for income statement classification purposes  we have developed a revenue allocation methodology for these arrangements that is consistent with the residual method used  and described under asc  when services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
in these circumstances  we allocate revenue to the various elements of the arrangement based on our vsoe of fair value and the residual amount is allocated to product revenue 
we sell product  product updates  technical support and services agreements to distributors at predetermined prices 
sales to distributors are not contingent upon resale of the software to the end user 
in most cases  we provide product updates  technical support and services agreements directly to distributors and the distributors provide support to the end customer 
we record revenue from sales to distributors at the amounts charged to the distributor and in the same manner as product  product updates  technical support and services sales sold through our direct sales force 
we classify amounts received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue 
sales taxes and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis and  as such  are excluded from revenues 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the income tax provision includes income taxes currently payable plus the net change during the year in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the differences between the carrying value under gaap and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
judgments and estimates are required in the calculation of the deferred tax assets  valuation allowance  research and development tax credits  and foreign tax credits 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for these positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
we continually review tax laws  regulations and guidance in order to properly record any uncertain tax positions 
at march   the gross unrecognized benefit related to uncertain tax benefits was   of which would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
the total 
table of contents amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of april  was  of this total   represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  net of federal benefit on state issues that  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal   and follows in thousands beginning balance gross decreases tax positions in prior period gross increases current period tax positions settlements lapse of statute of limitations foreign currency translation adjustment ending balance the following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under audit or remain open under the statute of limitations and are subject to examination by the tax authorities in the most significant jurisdictions that we operate australia fy fy belgium fy fy france fy fy germany fy fy singapore fy fy united kingdom fy fy united states fy fy maryland fy fy we are currently under an income tax audit in germany for fiscal years through and in the united states for fiscal year our continuing practice is to recognize interest  if any  related to income tax matters in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations and penalties as part of general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we recognized  in potential interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions and reversed  associated with potential claims now barred by the statute of limitations 
during fiscal  we recognized  in potential interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions and reversed  associated with potential claims now barred by the statute of limitations 
the total accrued interest and accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions at march  was  and  respectively 
we believe it is reasonably possible that significant changes in the liability for uncertain tax positions will occur in the next twelve months as a result of final decisions related to the voluntary payments of our state and local income taxes and lapse of statute of limitations 
in the aggregate  we believe the liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by  in the next twelve months 
stock based compensation 
asc compensation stock compensation requires an entity to recognize an expense within its income statement for all share based payment arrangements  which include employee stock option plans  restricted stock grants  and employee stock purchase plans 
we have elected to use straight line amortization of stock based compensation expense for the entire award over the service period since the awards have only service conditions and graded vesting 
our stock options and nonvested stock do not contain performance conditions 
there have been no modifications to awards in or 
table of contents our stock option grants are accounted for as equity awards 
the expense is based on the grant date fair value of the options granted  which we recognize over the requisite service period 
to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model estimates the per share fair value of an option on its date of grant based on the following the option s exercise price  the price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  the estimated dividend yield  a risk free interest rate  the estimated option term  and the expected volatility 
for the risk free interest rate  we use a us treasury bond due in a number of years equal to the option s expected term 
to estimate expected volatility  we analyze the historic volatility of our common stock 
we granted  stock options during fiscal as of march   nonvested stock based deferred compensation associated with the stock options totaled  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
we recognize compensation cost for stock option grants on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant 
we recognize compensation cost within the income statement in the same expense line as the cash compensation paid to the respective employees 
asc also requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to estimate future forfeitures of granted stock options 
we will recognize the impact on compensation cost due to changes in the expected forfeiture rate of in the period that they become known 
we do not apply a forfeiture rate to the options granted to certain key executives or directors 
we have concluded that historically certain key executives and directors will perform the requisite service to vest in the award 
we account for our restricted stock grants as equity awards 
the expense is based on the price of our common stock  and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the restricted stock agreements do not contain any post vesting restrictions 
we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to estimate future forfeitures of granted stock options 
as of march   nonvested stock based deferred compensation associated with restricted stock totaled million  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of year 
our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  provides all eligible employees to collectively purchase up to a total of  shares of our common stock 
on september   our stockholders voted to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the espp from  shares to  shares  effective february  an employee may authorize a payroll deduction up to a maximum of of his or her compensation during the plan period 
the purchase price for each share purchased is the lesser of of the closing price of the common stock on the first or last day of the plan period 
the plan period for the espp ends on the last day of january and july of each year 
to estimate the fair value of shares issued under our espp  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model estimates the per share fair value of an espp share at the beginning of the plan period based on the following the price of the underlying stock on the first day of the plan period  the estimated dividend yield  a risk free interest rate  the term of the plan period  which is six months  and the expected volatility 
for the risk free interest rate  we use a us treasury bond due in six months 
to determine expected volatility  we analyze the historical volatility of our stock over the months prior to the first day of the plan period 
we calculate the expense based on the difference between the fair market value of the shares purchased at the close of each plan period and the discounted price paid by the employee  and we recognize that expense on a straight line basis over the plan period 
as of march   nonvested stock based deferred compensation associated with the espp totaled  and we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of months 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we measure our cash and cash equivalents using the fair value measurement principles of asc fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  which requires that fair value be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability 
asc requires disclosures regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and 
table of contents liabilities and establishes a three tiered value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities must be grouped  based upon significant levels of inputs as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs  other than level prices  such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable inputs 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
this includes certain pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs 
the lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy 
we view corporate notes as level assets  and money market funds as level assets 
we did not hold any marketable securities at march  the following table summarizes the composition of our marketable securities at march  march  in thousands classification on balance sheet amortized cost gross unrealized gain gross unrealized loss market value short term investments long term investments corporate notes total marketable securities the following table details the fair value measurements within the three levels of fair value hierarchy of our financial assets  consisting of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  at march  and total fair value at march  fair value measurement at march  using level level level in thousands cash money market funds total total fair value at march  fair value measurement at march  using level level level in thousands cash money market funds corporate note total 
table of contents at march   we grouped money market funds using a level valuation because market prices in active markets for identical assets were readily available 
the per share net asset value of our money market funds has remained at a constant amount of per share 
also  as of march   there were no withdrawal limits on redemptions for any of the money market funds that we hold 
all money market funds were classified as cash and cash equivalents at march  and we did not group any financial assets using level or level valuations at march  allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for the limited circumstances when the customer disputes the amounts due us 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires significant estimates 
in estimating the allowance  we consider the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  should any of these factors change  our estimates may also change  which could affect the amount of our future allowance for doubtful accounts as well as future operating income 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances could be required 
as of march  and  accounts receivable totaled million and million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
we account for our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc  business combinations and asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
our intangible assets consist of acquired technology related to our acquisitions of a software product for modeling voice communications in december  altaworks in october  purchased technology we purchased from radview software  ltd 
in december  sqmworks  inc in april and network physics  inc in october our intangible assets also consist of customer relationships and acquired workforce assets we purchased from network physics  inc related to the purchase of specified assets of network physics in october the acquired and purchased technologies are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives of three to five years 
we amortize our customer relationship and workforce intangible assets we purchased from network physics  inc on an accelerated depreciation basis over their expected useful lives of four and one half years and five years  respectively 
we use the projected discounted cash flow method in valuing our acquired technology and purchased customer relationships using certain assumptions including revenue growth  cost levels  present value discount rate  and working capital requirements 
we use the lower of the amount of cash paid or the present value of projected discounted cash flows to value purchased technology 
we valued the workforce asset associated with the purchase of specified assets of network physics  inc on a replacement cost basis 
while we believe the assumptions used to value our acquired technology related to acquisitions are reasonable  actual results will likely differ from those assumptions 
future cash flows are subject to change for a variety of internal and external factors 
we will periodically review the value of acquired technology and purchased intangible assets for reasonableness in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment 
if changes in our assumptions at the time of future periodic reviews indicate that the carrying value of our acquired technology and purchased intangible assets exceeds their fair value and we determine that carrying amounts can not be recovered  it would result in impairment losses 
as of march  and  intangible assets totaled million and million  net of accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively 
we have not recorded any impairment losses to date 
we record goodwill when the consideration paid for acquisitions exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter to identify any facts or circumstances that indicate the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
the review is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections and the market capitalization of our common stock 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value 

table of contents we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of march  and and concluded that the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value  therefore  we did not record any impairment 
as of march  and  goodwill was million 
no impairment losses have been recorded to date 
accounting for software development costs 
we expense costs incurred in the research and development of new software products as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to our customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the working model stage 
to date  products and enhancements have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time and all research and development costs have been expensed

increases in the overall customer installed base increase the demand for annual renewals of maintenance contracts 
the dollar amount of our deferred revenue under our maintenance contracts at the end of each year is a key factor in determining the near term growth of our product updates  technical support and services revenue 
the balance of deferred revenue under our maintenance contracts generally increases when we sell product licenses and when we sell renewals of annual maintenance contracts 
the amount of deferred revenue under our maintenance contracts was million  million  and million at march    and  respectively

the increase in cost of professional services in fiscal from fiscal was largely due to a million increase in direct labor expense attributable to the use of more external contractors 
the increase in gross margin on professional services in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the increase in profitability related to certain consulting engagements

operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing increases of in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in compensation expense as a result of increased staffing levels required for developing new products as well as sustaining and upgrading existing products  which was partially offset by a  decrease in contractor costs 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in compensation expense as a result of increased staffing levels

provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates were   and negative for fiscal   and  respectively 
for fiscal  the effective tax rate differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to state income taxes  differential in the united states and foreign tax rates  research and development credits and the domestic production activities deduction 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to an increase in tax credits and a decrease in foreign tax expense 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to an increase in our book income which diluted the impact of permanent differences as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and varies from period to period due principally to the amount of income before taxes from various tax jurisdictions  tax exempt interest income  foreign tax expense  and the amount of tax credits available to us in each period from incremental research expenditures 
future provisions for taxes will depend  among other things  on the mix and amount of worldwide income  the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions and the amount of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits and other items for which we are eligible 
liquidity and capital resources as of march  and  we had cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities totaling million and million  respectively

cash provided by operating activities is primarily derived from net income  as adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense  tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue and net income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which were slightly offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in the growth of deferred revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which was partially offset by an increase in cash resulting from an increase in net income and accrued liabilities

for fiscal   and  excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options were   and  respectively 
we have commitments under contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services 
these contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business 
for example  we are contractually committed to make minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
in accordance with current accounting rules  the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits under asc is reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect to fund these contractual arrangements with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as cash generated from operations in the normal course of business

the credit facility permitted the use of funds for general corporate purposes and the issuance of letters of credit up to a maximum of 
table of contents million in the aggregate 
as of march   the lender under our credit facility had issued letters of credit in favor of the beneficiaries under a number of our operating leases in the aggregate amount of million 
upon a default  as defined in the respective office lease agreement  the applicable landlord has the right to draw upon its letter of credit in whole or in part 
interest under this facility  including interest on any amounts drawn under the letters of credit  is payable monthly at an annual rate of 
the credit facility is collateralized by our accounts receivable 
effective march   in light of our strong cash position  we elected to eliminate any borrowing capacity under the credit facility in excess of our existing outstanding letters of credit 
we expect working capital needs to increase in the foreseeable future in order for us to execute our business plan and growth strategies 
we anticipate that operating activities  as well as expected capital expenditures incurred in the normal course of business  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products as well as repurchase our common stock in accordance with our stock repurchase program authorized by our board in january  and the payment of dividends to our stockholders 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and dividends at least through fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and  accordingly  there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  approved the fasb accounting standards codification accounting standards update  or asu   or the codification  as the single source of authoritative non government gaap

all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification has become non authoritative 
the codification did not change gaap  but instead introduces a new structure that combines all authoritative standards into a comprehensive  topically organized online database 
we adopted the codification on july   which impacts our financial statements as all future references to authoritative accounting literature have been referenced in accordance with the codification 
there have been no changes to the content of our financial statements or disclosures as a result of implementing the codification

asu also amends the scoping guidance for software arrangements to exclude tangible products that contain software elements and nonsoftware elements that function together to interdependently deliver the product s essential functionality 
asu will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june  asu will be effective for us beginning april  early adoption is permitted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risks and believe that the risk is minimal 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the value of our cash equivalents or marketable securities 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and did not have any short term marketable securities 
as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and  in short term marketable securities 
based on our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as of march   a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately million 
at march   million of our million in cash and cash equivalents was held in money market funds 
the money market funds are predominately backed by united states government securities 
the per share net asset value of our money market funds has remained at a constant amount of per share 
also  as of march  there were no withdrawal limits on redemptions for any of the money market funds that we hold 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the united states dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into united states dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
the accumulated currency translation adjustment  recorded as a separate component of stockholder s equity  was a loss of  and a loss of million at march  and  respectively 
a majority of our revenue transactions outside the united states are denominated in local currencies and the majority of operating expenses associated with our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies  therefore  our results of operations and financial condition are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound and the european union euro 
we currently do not

approximately   and of our total revenue for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively  was generated from outside of the united states 
due to the limited nature of our foreign operations  we do not believe that a change in exchange rates would have a material effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
based on our revenue and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  a increase or decrease in exchange rates would increase or decrease our consolidated net income by approximately   and  respectively
