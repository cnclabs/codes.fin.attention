table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
arpeggio acquisition corporation arpeggio was incorporated in delaware in as a specified purpose acquisition corporation 
on june   arpeggio merged with hill international  inc old hill  a delaware corporation  and arpeggio was the surviving entity of the merger 
old hill was founded in by our current chairman and chief executive officer  irvin e 
richter 
immediately following the merger  the stockholders of old hill owned approximately of the total voting power of arpeggio 
the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under us generally accepted accounting principles pursuant to which old hill was considered to be the acquiring entity and arpeggio was the acquired company for accounting purposes  accompanied by a recapitalization of old hill 
accordingly  the historical financial statements relate to the business of old hill and its consolidated subsidiaries 
following the merger  arpeggio changed its name to hill international  inc in this report  the terms company  we  us  our or hill refer to hill international  inc reimbursable expenses are reflected in equal amounts in both total revenue and total direct expenses 
because these revenue costs are subject to significant fluctuation from year to year  we measure the performance of many of our key operating metrics as a percentage of consulting fee revenue cfr  as we believe that this is a better and more consistent measure of operating performance than total revenue 
overview cfr increased  or  from  in to  in cfr for the project management segment increased  principally due to strong organic growth in the middle east and north africa 
cfr for the construction claims segment increased  due primarily to strong organic growth in the middle east 
reimbursable expenses increased  or  from  in to  in principally due to the higher use of subcontractors in the middle east  new york and philadelphia 
cost of services increased  or  from  in to  in as a result of an increase in employees and other direct expenses needed to support the increase in cfr 
gross profit increased  or  from  in to  in due to the increases in cfr 
gross profit as a percent of cfr decreased from in to in principally because of increased labor costs in the middle east and the use of outside experts on a large project was billed at margins significantly lower than internal staff in the united kingdom 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  principally due to an increase of  in staff costs  an increase in bad debts of  offset by a  reduction in legal fees 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased  from  in to  in due to a significant increase in the scope of iran reconstruction program work for our affiliate  stanley baker hill  and from hill tmg  a joint venture formed in may income taxes increased  or  from  in to  in as our pre tax income increased  or  from  in to  in the effective tax rate was in compared with in net earnings increased  or  from  in to  in diluted earnings per common share were in based upon  diluted common shares outstanding compared to in based upon  diluted common shares outstanding 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make subjective decisions  assessments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the judgment increases  such judgments become even more subjective 
while management believes its assumptions are reasonable and appropriate  actual results may be materially different than estimated 
revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from providing professional services to our clients 
revenue is generally recognized upon the performance of services 
in providing these services  we may incur reimbursable expenses  which consist of amounts paid to subcontractors and other third parties as well as travel and other job related expenses that are contractually reimbursable from clients 
we will include reimbursable expenses in computing and reporting our total contract revenue as long as we remain responsible to the client for the fulfillment of the contract and for the overall acceptability of all services provided 
we earn our revenue from cost plus  fixed price and time and materials contracts 
if estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss  we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss becomes known 
the cumulative effect of revisions to revenue  estimated costs to complete contracts  including penalties  incentive awards  change orders  claims  anticipated losses  and other effects are recorded in the accounting period in which the events indicating a loss are known and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such revisions could occur at any time and the effects may be material 
the majority of our contracts are for work where we bill the client monthly at hourly billing rates 
the hourly billing rates are determined by contract terms 
for governmental clients  the hourly rates are generally calculated as either i a negotiated multiplier of our direct labor costs or ii as direct labor costs plus overhead costs plus a negotiated profit percentage 
for commercial clients  the hourly rates are generally taken from a standard fee schedule by staff classification or they can be at a negotiated discount from this schedule 
in some cases  primarily for foreign work  a fixed monthly staff rate is negotiated rather than an hourly rate 
this monthly rate is determined based upon a buildup of direct labor costs plus overhead and profit 
we account for these contracts on a time and expenses method  recognizing revenue as costs are incurred 
we account for fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion method  wherein revenue is recognized as costs are incurred 
under the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition  we estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to be recognized 
we generally utilize a cost to cost approach in applying the percentage of completion method  where revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred 
under the percentage of completion method  recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of estimates 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenue  the extent of progress towards completion and contract completion costs on our long term construction management contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
estimates used in determining accounts receivable allowances are based on specific client account reviews and historical experience of credit losses 
we also apply judgment including assessments about changes in economic conditions  concentration of receivables among clients and industries  recent write off trends  rates of 
table of contents bankruptcy  and credit quality of specific clients 
unanticipated changes in the financial condition of clients  the resolution of various disputes  or significant changes in the economy could impact the reserves required 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  the project management unit and the construction claims unit 
we made that determination based on the similarity of the services provided  the methodologies in delivering our services and the similarity of the client base in each of these units 
generally  we perform an impairment assessment during our third fiscal quarter 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for hill  the period over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
changes in future market conditions  our business strategy  or other factors could impact upon the future values of hill s reporting units  which could result in future impairment charges 
based on the valuation as of july   the fair values of the project management unit and construction claims unit substantially exceeded their carrying values 
we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and review the long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals  as appropriate  to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
income taxes we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws  published tax guidance  as well as estimates of future earnings 
these judgments and interpretations affect the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance 
we evaluated the deferred tax assets and determined on the basis of objective factors that the net assets will be realized through future years taxable income 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates and assessments  additional valuation allowances may be required 
we will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that the position is more likely than not ie  a likelihood greater than percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the term tax position refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 
stock options we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards made to directors  employees and consultants 
the awards include stock options and restricted stock grants 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility  expected life and stock option exercise behavior 

table of contents contingencies management estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to insurance claims that fall below policy deductibles and to litigation and other legal claims and contingencies  as well as in determining our liabilities for incurred but not reported insurance claims 
significant judgments by us and reliance on third party experts are utilized in determining probable and or reasonably estimable amounts to be recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
the results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which the changes are determined 
we do not believe that material changes to these estimates are reasonably likely to occur
