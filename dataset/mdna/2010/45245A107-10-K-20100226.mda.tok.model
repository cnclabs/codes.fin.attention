working capital is calculated as the sum of accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable for the years ended december     and we invested certain funds in active cash management and classified those investments in other current assets or other assets depending on remaining maturity 
these amounts represented million as of december   in addition to cash and equivalents 
these investments have since matured  which resulted in no cash management investment balance for the years ended december    and these operational measures  which we regularly use  are provided to assist in the investor s further understanding of our operations 
days sales outstanding is calculated using the count back method  which calculates the number of days of most recent revenue that are reflected in the net accounts receivable balance 
days of inventory supply is calculated using the current period inventory balance divided by an estimate of the inventoriable portion of cost of goods sold expressed in days 
the prior period amount of days of inventory supply have been adjusted to reflect the current year calculation for comparative purposes

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to be read in conjunction with item business  the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading global developer and marketer of branded offerings that enable people to capture  save and enjoy digital information 
our portfolio of recordable optical media  magnetic tape media  flash products and consumer electronic products and accessories reaches customers through our global distribution network 
our goal is to be a company with strong commercial and consumer businesses that creates shareholder value through continued long term growth and profitability 
we seek to differentiate our products through unique designs  product positioning  packaging  merchandising and branding 
in addition to overall industry trends described under business in item of this form k  the global economic downturn which began in continued to negatively affect demand in for both our commercial and consumer product lines as well as our suppliers  distributors and channel partners 
the impact of the economic downturn has been significant 
for example  as a result of the financial market turmoil  data center customers in several large banks and financial services firms scaled back or deferred spending until late this impacted magnetic tape sales for some of our highest margin products 
in addition  consumer spending slowed globally in and the trend continued throughout  which impacted sales of our consumer electronic products 
strategy our long term strategy is built upon three key elements which we describe as optimize  grow and extend 
optimize our magnetic tape business 
the magnetic tape market remains an attractive market for imation because of our significant market share  brand and product portfolio  intellectual property  solid industry reputation and relationships among key original equipment manufacturers oems  global distribution and manufacturing capability 
there is growing demand for data storage capacity across a substantial installed base of commercial information technology users 
the magnetic tape business has a relatively small number of competitors and high barriers to entry 
at the same time  it is highly competitive as the overall market size  in terms of revenue  is declining 
in may of  we started a major restructuring of our manufacturing operations to optimize our magnetic tape business and stabilize or reduce our manufacturing costs 
as a result  we have concentrated our direct manufacturing investments on coating operations and have outsourced other parts of manufacturing operations for magnetic tape 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we continue to invest broadly in tape technology and seek to maintain and extend value added technology capabilities in key areas  including precision thin film tape coating 
grow the data storage media business  offering products under multiple brands 
over the years  we have brought to market recordable media products beyond magnetic tape  including recordable optical media  removable usb flash drives and flash cards  solid state drives and external and removable hard disk products 
we have also acquired additional brands  beyond the imation brand  and have established distribution agreements for other brands  as described above 
the strength of our brands has allowed us to gain market share in world wide optical media markets 
in addition  with over half of our revenue coming from outside the united states  we seek to leverage our global marketing and distribution capability by bringing products to market across multiple geographies 
extend certain brands selectively across multiple product categories 
we sell accessories and certain consumer electronic products  selectively  under multiple brands in various regions of the world 
with the acquisition of memcorp we entered into the consumer electronics market to sell certain products which we did not offer previously 
our product portfolio includes cd and dvd players  alarm clocks  portable boom boxes  mp players  ipod and iphone accessories  flat panel televisions  headphones  speakers  karaoke machines and gaming accessories sold under the memorex  tdk life on record and xtrememac brands 
the portfolio continues to evolve with consumer demand and with development of our brands 
we have taken several actions which we believe have increased our industry presence and relevance in both commercial and consumer retail channels and markets globally 
these steps have broadened the scope of our business and have allowed us to better address the large and growing consumer market for data storage media and audio video consumer electronics and accessories 
the most significant actions driving this change over the past five years include the following in april  we acquired substantially all of the assets of memorex international inc memorex  including the memorex brand name and the capital stock of its operating subsidiaries engaged in design  development  sourcing  marketing  distribution and sale of hardware  media and accessories used for the storage of electronic data under the memorex brand name 
this action strengthened our position in optical products and accessories  especially in the united states retail channel 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in february  we entered into agreements that established us as the exclusive global distributor for hp branded recordable optical media products and as a master distributor for sun storagetek branded tape media products  whether manufactured by imation or others 
in july  we acquired memcorp 
this action established our foundation in the consumer electronic products in the mass merchant channel and enabled us to better manage the memorex brand name across all retail channels in the united states 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in july  we acquired tdk recording media 
this action further strengthened our optical market position  especially in the important consumer markets of europe and japan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets of xtrememac  a florida based product development and design firm focused on consumer electronic products and accessories for the ipod  iphone and apple tv markets 
this action was taken to expand our product portfolio  enhance our distribution reach and strengthen product design capabilities  with particular focus on apple users 
other agreements have given us exclusive and non exclusive distribution rights for certain brands of recordable media in various regions or product categories 
examples of other distribution agreements include those with prostor systems inc and tandberg data asa tandberg

off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating lease commitments discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are not using off balance sheet arrangements  including special purpose entities 
summary of contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations litigation settlement other liabilities total the majority of the purchase obligations consist of day rolling estimates 
each month  we provide various suppliers with rolling forecasts of our demand for products for the next three months 
the forecasted amounts are generally binding on us as follows percent for the first month  percent for the second month and percent for the third month 
timing of payments for the vast majority of other liabilities cannot be reasonably determined and  as such  have been included in the more than years category 
the table above does not include payments for non contributory defined benefit pension plans 
it is our general practice  at a minimum  to fund amounts sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in applicable benefits laws and local tax laws 
from time to time  we contribute additional amounts  as we deem appropriate 
we expect to contribute approximately million to million to our pension plans in and have million recorded in other liabilities related to pension plans as of december  the table above does not include possible payments for uncertain tax positions 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of december  due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
we may be required to pay additional cash consideration of up to million  million and million related to the tdk recording media  memcorp and xtrememac business acquisitions  respectively  contingent on future financial performance of the acquired businesses 
we have not recorded a liability for these contingent payments at december  as payment is not probable based on current financial performance 
the above table does not include any contingent purchase price adjustments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
we record income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
gaap guidance for accounting for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the standard more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million of which million relates to deferred tax assets in the united states 
these net deferred tax assets are net of valuation allowances of million 
the valuation allowance relates to various worldwide operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize 
based on our assessment  it appears more likely than not that the recorded net deferred tax asset at december  will be realized through future taxable earnings 
we will continue to assess the required valuation allowance in the future 
we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results  including further market deterioration  and may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
if future results from our operations are less than projected  particularly in our primary markets  a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets  which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 
effective january   we adopted additional guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this guidance defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
tax returns filed in  and remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service 
the years through remain subject to examination by foreign tax jurisdictions and state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdictions 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly during the next twelve months due to the resolution of certain us and international tax uncertainties  however it is not possible to estimate the potential change at this time 
litigation 
in accordance with gaap related to accounting for contingencies  we record a liability when a loss from litigation is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  we believe that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is our opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to us beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to our financial position 
as additional information becomes available  the potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
goodwill and other intangibles 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by gaap guidance for business combinations 
the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  the determination of useful lives of intangible assets and subsequent impairment analyses require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment in accordance with gaap guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under certain situations  interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
other intangible assets are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
intangible assets are amortized using methods that approximate the benefit provided by utilization of the assets 
in determining the useful life of a trade name  we consider the following the overall strength of the trade name in the market in terms of market awareness and market share  the length of time that the trade name has been in existence  the period of time over which the trade name is expected to remain in use and the strength of the trade name and its perseverance through changes in the data storage industry 
in determining the useful lives of other intangible assets  we consider the period over which a majority of the economic benefits provided by the asset will be realized by the company 
we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets including intangible assets to test whether current events or circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the tests indicate that the carrying value of the asset is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset  an impairment loss would be recognized which is determined as the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis 
we have determined that our reporting units are our segments with the exception of the americas data storage media segment which is further divided between the americas consumer and americas commercial reporting units 
inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the annual test of goodwill impairment  no impairments were identified 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying value step of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used a weighting of the valuations calculated using market multiples and the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the market approach establishes fair value by comparing our company to other publicly traded guideline companies or by analysis of actual transactions of similar businesses or assets sold 
in determining the fair value of reporting units  we weighted values under the income approach percent and values determined from market comparables percent 
the basis of this weighting is due to the fact that the income approach is tailored to the circumstances of the business  and the market approach is completed as a secondary test to ensure that the results of the income approach are reasonable and in line with comparable companies in the industry 
the summation of our reporting units fair values is compared and reconciled to our market capitalization as of the date of our impairment test 
in the situation where a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the measurement of the impairment step of the impairment test is calculated by determining the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
in determining the fair value of our ep reporting unit under the income approach  our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions 
fair value on a discounted cash flow basis uses forecasts over a year period with an estimation of residual growth rates thereafter 
we use our business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
the most significant assumptions incorporated in these forecasts for the most recent goodwill impairment tests included annual revenue changes with an average annual growth rate of percent and significant growth of greater than percent in and  and with a terminal growth rate of percent 
a discount rate of percent was used in the analysis to reflect the relevant risks of the higher growth assumed for this reporting unit 
an increase in the discount rate of one percent would have decreased the reporting unit s fair value by million while a decrease in the discount rate by one percent would have increased the reporting unit s fair value by million 
the revenue growth in and are significant assumptions within the projections 
if revenue growth were held to approximately percent for each of those years and reducing thereafter  reducing the average annual growth rate to percent and the discount rate to percent  the indicated fair value of the reporting unit would be reduced by approximately million and would not result in an impairment 
there are also various assumptions used under the market approach that affect the valuation of our reporting units 
the most significant assumptions are market multiples and control premium 
in estimating the fair value of our company under the market approach  we considered the relative merits of commonly applied market capitalization multiples based on the availability of data 
based on our analysis  we determined the market value of invested capital to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiple to be the most appropriate valuation multiple to be applied in the application of the market approach 
as a result of our analysis of fair value from the combination of our discounted cash flow modeling and market comparisons  we utilized a stock price of per share on the november  testing date in determining and allocating fair value to our reporting units as compared to a stock price of per share on the november  testing date for goodwill impairment 
a control premium of percent was used in our determination of fair value which represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the company 
the control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years 
although our overall expected future cash flows were reduced from our prior year projections  the excess working capital identified in the prior year valuation combined with the working capital initiatives described in our management s discussion and analysis reduced the carrying value of the reporting unit greater than the reduction in fair value 
the indicated excess in fair value over carrying value of the ep reporting unit in step one of the impairment test at november  and goodwill is as follows percentage of excess of fair excess of fair value over value over carrying in millions goodwill carrying value carrying value value electronic products while management s most recent analyses indicates that this goodwill is not impaired  to the extent that actual results or other assumptions about future economic conditions or potential for our growth and profitability in this business changes  it is possible that our conclusion regarding the remaining goodwill could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we extend credit to our customers in the normal course of business 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses based upon our loss history and our aging analysis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period based on a detailed analysis of our accounts receivable 
in the analysis  we consider the age of the customer s receivable and also consider the creditworthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions  among other factors 
if any of these factors change  we may also change our original estimates  which could impact the level of our future allowance for doubtful accounts 
if payment is not made timely  we will contact the customer to try to obtain payment 
once all collection efforts are exhausted  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
excess inventory and obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for excess  slow moving and obsolescence to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
rebates 
we maintain an accrual for customer rebates that totaled million as of december  included in other current liabilities 
this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
other reserves including restructuring 
employee related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans 
these charges are reflected in the quarter in which management approves the associated actions  the actions are probable  and the amounts are estimable 
severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees remaining service periods 
other accrued liabilities 
we also have other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to us 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and projected salary increases 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is december see note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosures of these assumptions for both the us and international plans 
the discount rate assumptions are tied to portfolios of long term high quality bonds and are  therefore  subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate used in calculating the benefit obligation in the united states was percent at december   as compared to percent at december  a discount rate reduction of percent increases us pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the investment portfolios for the pension plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the respective portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
we use historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the rate of return used in calculating the pension expense for  and was percent 
a change of percent for the expected return on plan assets assumption will increase united states net pension plan expense pre tax by million 
expected returns on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the united states plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
in the united states  we have used the rate of percent for the past four years 
mortality assumptions were obtained from the irs static mortality table 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities held at fair value 
specifically  the new guidance requires a gross presentation of activities within the level roll forward and adds a new requirement to disclose transfers in and out of level and measurements 
this guidance is applicable to all entities currently required to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the effective date for these disclosures is the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december   except for the gross presentation of the level roll forward information  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and for interim reporting periods within those years 
we do not expect these disclosures to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification 
the codification became the single authoritative source for gaap  replacing the mix of accounting standards that have evolved over the last fifty plus years 
while not intended to change gaap  the codification significantly changes the way in which accounting literature is organized 
it will now be organized by accounting topic  which is intended to enable users to more quickly identify the guidance that applies to a specific accounting issue 
as required  we adopted this guidance for the period ended september  the adoption of the codification impacts only our disclosures and did not have any material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued guidance to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements 
prior to this issuance  fair values for these assets and liabilities were only disclosed annually 
this guidance applies to all financial instruments with limited exceptions and requires all entities to disclose the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
we adopted the new guidance as of june  the adoption of the newly issued guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  fasb issued additional requirements for disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
specifically  the guidance requires expanded disclosures for plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans  similar to the disclosures required for assets held at fair value beginning in these expanded disclosures about plan assets are required for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of the newly issued guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies 
due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards  management has not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements with respect to our future goals  including statements contained in this form k  in our other filings with the sec and in our reports to shareholders

we wish to caution investors not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements 
any forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after such date 
risk factors include our ability to successfully implement our strategy  our ability to grow our business in new products with profitable margins  the possibility that our goodwill  deferred tax assets  or other assets may become further impaired  our ability to introduce new offerings in a timely manner either independently or in association with oems or other third parties  the market acceptance of newly introduced product and service offerings  the potential dependence on third parties for new product introductions or technologies in order to introduce our own new products  continuing uncertainty in global and regional economic conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  the volatility of the markets in which we operate  our ability to successfully manage multiple brands globally  our ability to achieve the expected benefits from our strategic relationships and distribution agreements  the competitive pricing environment and its possible impact on profitability and inventory valuations  the ready availability and price of energy and key raw materials or critical components  our ability to meet our revenue growth and cost reduction targets  our ability to secure adequate supply of certain high demand products at acceptable prices  the rate of revenue decline for certain existing products  our ability to efficiently source  warehouse and distribute our products globally  significant changes in discount rates and other assumptions used in the valuation of our pension plans  our ability to continue realizing the benefits from our global manufacturing strategy for magnetic data storage products and the related restructuring  our ability to secure and maintain adequate shelf and display space over time at retailers which conduct semi annual or annual line reviews  the future financial and operating performance of major customers and industries served  our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property rights  the outcome of any pending or future litigation  the volatility of our stock price due to our results or market trends  as well as various factors set forth in item a of this form k and from time to time in our filings with the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of our revenue in  may be subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations 
the additional risks include political and economic instability  terrorist activity  the possibility of expropriation  trade tariffs or embargoes  unfavorable tax laws  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
our foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of the foreign currency risks over near term periods  however  we cannot ensure that these risk management activities will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
although we attempt to utilize hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  our revenue or costs are adversely impacted when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs 
in accordance with established policies and procedures  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options  combination option strategies and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging include the accuracy of our forecasts  the volatility of the currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
the utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
an immediate adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables including interest rates held constant would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash investments and foreign currency derivatives 
we do not believe that our cash investments and foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we monitor and manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with each counterparty
