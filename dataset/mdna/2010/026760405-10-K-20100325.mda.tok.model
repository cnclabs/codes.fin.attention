item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an insurance holding company engaged in the insurance and reinsurance business through our wholly owned insurance company  independence american insurance company independence american  our marketing organizations  including our three medical stop loss managing general underwriter subsidiaries our mgus  our two insurance and marketing agencies ipa and hio  and our claims administration company  eca 
since november  amic has been affiliated with independence holding company ihc  which owned of amic s stock as of december  in march  upon approval of the amic board of directors  ihc acquired control of amic through the purchase of additional shares of common stock in the open market 
ihc s senior management has provided direction to us through service agreements between us and ihc 
in  independence american s primary source of revenu e was reinsurance premiums 
the majority of these premiums are ceded to independence american from ihc under long term reinsurance treaties to cede its gross medical stop loss premiums written to independence american 
in addition  independence american assumes fully insured health and short term statutory disability benefit product in new york state dbl premiums from ihc  and assumes medical stop loss premiums from unaffiliated carriers 
independence american began writing group major medical  medical stop loss  major medical plans for individuals and families  and short term medical in  and added dental in given its a excellent rating from am best  independence american expects to expand the distribution of its medical stop loss products  and slightly increase the business written on its paper  especially major medical plans for individuals and families 
while management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning  the overriding consideration is underwriting profitability 
management s assessment of trends in healthcare and in the medical stop loss market play a significant role in determining whether to expand independence american s health insurance premiums 
since independence american reinsures a portion of all of the business produced by our mgus  and since these companies are also eligible to earn profit sharing commissions based on the profitability of the business they place  our mgus also emphasize underwriting profitability 
in addition  management focuses on controlling operating costs 
by sharing employees with ihc and sharing resources among our subsidiaries  we strive to maximize our earnings 
the following is a summary of key performance information and events year ended december  revenues expenses income from continuing operations  before income tax provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss on disposition of discontinued operations  net of tax net income less net income attributable to the non controlling interest net income attributable to american independence corp 
net income per share increased to

per share  diluted  or million for the year ended december  the book value of the company s stockholders equity increased to per share at december  compared to per share at december  at december   of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade 
consolidated investment yields were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower yield is due to an increase in more liquid assets which bear lower interest rates 
premiums earned decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to lower assumed medical stop loss premiums and lower group major medical premiums written 
the company recorded improved loss ratios in both fully insured health and medical stop loss for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  independence american wrote million and million  respectively  of individual health business produced by our marketing organization ipa 
underwriting experience  as indicated by its gaap combined ratios on our three lines of business for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands medical stop loss premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves expenses loss ratio a expense ratio b combined ratio c fully insured health premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves expenses loss ratio a expense ratio b combined ratio c dbl premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves expenses loss ratio a expense ratio b combined ratio c a loss ratio represents insurance benefits claims and reserves divided by premiums earned 
b expense ratio represents net commissions including profit commissions  administrative fees  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses divided by premiums earned 
c the combined ratio is equal to the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
in  our mgus wrote an aggregate of million of annualized gross premium compared to million in this reduction in premiums was due  in part  to planned pricing increases  stricter underwriting guidelines  the continuing generally soft market  and liquidation of independencecare 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  where material  including legal and other fees  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are estimated in accordance with gaap 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
all of the company s policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company s methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company s reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
medical stop loss the company s medical stop loss business is comprised of employer stop loss and hmo reinsurance 
the two primary or key assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net loss ratio assumption could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity material effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is determined using assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
this was the case with the  and underwriting years that increased decreased by   and loss ratio points  respectively 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible  based on the company s experience to date  it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below the expected projected net loss ratio for at december  the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statements of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to applicable underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than fully insured medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from all of its mgus for prior underwriting years 
fully insured health reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured health reserves is that historical claim development patterns are representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in product design  changes in time delay in submission of claims and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impact of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors  the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
premium and mgu fee income revenue recognition direct and assumed premiums from short duration contracts are recognized as revenue over the period of the contracts in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
the company records mgu fee income as policy premium payments are earned 
our mgus are compensated in two ways 
they earn fee income based on the volume of business produced  and collect profit sharing commissions if such business exceeds certain profitability benchmarks 
profit sharing commissions are accounted for beginning in the period in which the company believes they are reasonably estimable  which is typically at the point that claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
reinsurance amounts recoverable or paid for under reinsurance contracts are included in total assets or total liabilities as due from reinsurers or due to reinsurers 
in  independence american derived most of its business from pro rata quota share reinsurance treaties with standard security life and madison national life  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of ihc 
these treaties terminate on december   unless terminated sooner by independence american 
standard security life and madison national life must cede at least of their medical stop loss business to independence american under these treaties 
additionally  standard security life  madison national life and independence american have received regulatory approval to cede up to to independence american under most of ihc s medical stop loss programs 
for each of the twelve months ended december  and  standard security life and madis on national life ceded an average of approximately of their medical stop loss business to independence american 
independence american reinsures of standard security life s dbl business 
standard security life and madison national life also ceded approximately of the majority of their fully insured health business to independence american 
in addition  in  independence american ceded of its short term medical and of its major medical for individuals and families business to unaffiliated reinsurers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management believes that although sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance has been adjusted to account for the expected utilization of net operating losses against future taxable income 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire between and us federal and california tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
investments the company has classified all of its investments as available for sale securities 
these investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets for available for sale securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
premiums and discounts on debt securities purchased at other than par value are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income in the consolidated statements of operations  using the constant yield method over the period to maturity 
net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices when available 
in some cases  we use quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets and or model derived valuations where inputs are observable in active markets 
when there are limited or inactive trading markets  we use industry standard pricing methodologies  including discounted cash flow models  whose inputs are based on management assumptions and available current market information 
further  we retain independent pricing vendors to assist in valuing certain instruments 
declines in value of securities available for sale that are judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method 
the company reviews its investment securities regularly and determines whether other than temporary impairments have occurred 
for fixed maturities  if a decline in fair value is judged by management to be other than temporary  and the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the security s amortized cost  the impairment is bifurcated into a the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss  and b the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized by a charge to total other than temporary impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operat ions  establishing a new cost basis for the security 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
the factors considered by management in its regular review include  but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  subordinated credit support  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  current expected cash flows  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions including  in the case of fixed maturities  the effect of changes in market interest rates  and the company s intent to sell  or be required to sell  the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its re maining amortized cost basis 
equity securities may experience other than temporary impairment in the future based on the prospects for full recovery in value in a reasonable period of time and the company s ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
if a decline in fair value is judged by management to be other than temporary or management does not have the intent and ability to hold a security  a loss is recognized by a charge to total other than temporary impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the purpose of other than temporary impairment evaluations  preferred stocks are treated in a manner similar to debt securities 
declines in the creditworthiness of the issuer of debt securities with both debt and equity like features requires the use of the equity model in analyzing the security for other than temporary impairment 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which consist of licenses  are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment in the aggregate at the end of the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators arise 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill  further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required 
any impairment write down of goodwill would be charged to expense 
no impairment charge was required in or if the company experiences a sustained decline in its results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  the company may incur a material non cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results

premiums earned 
premiums earned decreased  or  to  for  compared to  for the company currently has three lines of business 
premiums relating to medical stop loss business were  and  for and  respectively 
this is due to a decrease in medical stop loss premiums assumed by independence american  partially offset by an increase in medical stop loss written by independence american 
premiums relating to fully insured health consisting of group major medical  limited medical  short term medical  dental  vision  and individual health were  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in group major medical premiums written by independence american  and a decrease in group major medical premiums assumed from ihc  offset by an increase in individual health premiums written by independence american 
premiums relating to dbl were  and  for and  respectively

net investment income decreased  to  for  compared to  for the investment yields were and for the lower yield is due to an increase in more liquid assets which bear lower interest rates 
net realized investment gains and other than temporary impairment losses 
the company recorded a net realized investment gain of  for  compared to a loss of  for for and  the company recorded a realized loss of and  respectively  for other than temporary impairments 
the loss of  as of december  represents a loss on bonds and preferred stock that the company determined to be other than temporary due to the severity of the decrease in market values and the length of time that these securities were in a loss position 
also  in the fourth quarter of  the company became aware of certain activities engaged in by the non affiliate broker dealer that managed a trading account of the company 
accordingly  the company recorded a  loss  net of expected recoveries  in the fourth quarter of relating to assets invest ed with this broker dealer 
the company s decision as to whether to sell securities is based on management s ongoing evaluation of investment opportunities and economic market conditions  thus creating fluctuations in realized gains or losses from period to period

the unrealized gain for and reflects the lower probability of edh business meeting target benchmarks 
insurance benefits  claims and reserves 
insurance benefits claims and reserves decreased  or  to  for  compared to  for the decrease of  is primarily comprised of a decrease in assumed medical stop loss of  and a decrease in direct fully insured of  due to lower premiums written and improved loss ratios in group major medical  slightly offset by higher premiums and higher loss ratios in individual health 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to  for  compared to  for this decrease is primarily due to i lower commission expense of  incurred by independence american primarily resulting from a decrease in premiums assumed in medical stop loss business and group major medical premiums written  and ii lower expenses at independencecare and marlton of  and  respectively  primarily due to lower payroll expenses 
this was offset by i the additional expense at ipa of  which includes commissions and other general expenses of the agency  ii  at eca  which was formed in the fourth quarter of  and iii an increase in underwriting expenses at independence american of  due to costs associated with higher individual health premiums written 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization and depreciation expense increased  to  for  compared to  for the increase in amortization is primarily due to the acquisition of of ipa in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased  to  an effective rate of  for  compared to  an effective rate of  for net income for and includes a non cash provision for federal income taxes of  and  respectively 
the state tax effective rate decreased to for  compared to for as compared to our mgus  independence american pays a nominal amount of state income tax  therefore  the company s state tax effective rate will decrease relative to an increase in independence american s pre tax income 
for as long as amic utilizes its nol carryforwards  it will not pay any income taxes  except for federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
gain loss on discontinued operations 
loss on discontinued operations  net of tax was for  compared to  for the loss of  in was due to the loss of rental income associated with the sublease of a property located in livermore  california  and a re estimation of expected expenses related to the lease see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income attributable to the non controlling interest 
the company recorded net income attributable to the non controlling interest of  and  for and  respectively 
the net income for relates to the non controlling interest in ipa and the non controlling interest in hio 
the net income for relates to the non controlling interest in marlton through march   the non controlling interest in ipa  and the non controlling interest in hio 
net income attributable to american independence corp 
the net income attributable to the company increased to  or 
per share  diluted  for  compared to  or 
per share  diluted  for liquidity and capital resources independence american independence american principally derives cash flow from i operations  ii the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed income securities  and iii earnings on investments and other investing activities 
such cash flow is partially used to finance liabilities for insurance policy benefits and reinsurance obligations 
corporate corporate derives cash flow funds principally from dividends and tax payments from its subsidiaries and investment income from corporate liquidity 
the ability of independence american to pay dividends to its parent company is governed by delaware insurance laws and regulations  otherwise  there are no regulatory constraints on the ability of any of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to its parent company 
for the twelve months ended december   our mgus and agencies paid  in dividends to corporate 
cash flows as of december   the company had  of cash  cash equivalents  and investments net of amounts due to from brokers compared with  as of december  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was  net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was  at december   the company had  of restricted cash at our mgus 
the amount at our mgus is directly offset by corresponding liabilities for premium and claim funds payable of  this asset  in part  represents the premium that is remitted by the insureds and is collected by our mgus on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent 
each month the premium is remitted to the insurance carriers by our mgus 
until such remittance is made the collected premium is carried as an asset on the balance sheet of each of our mgus with a corresponding payable to each insurance carrier 
in addition to the premium being held at our mgus  our mgus are in possession of cash to pay claims 
the cash is deposited by each insurance carrier into a bank account that our mgus can access 
the cash is used by our mgus to pay claims on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent 
the availab ility of cash enables our mgus to reimburse claims in a timely manner 
at december   the company had  of insurance reserves that it expects to pay out of current assets and cash flows from future business 
if necessary  the company could utilize the cash received from maturities and repayments of its fixed maturity investments if the timing of claim payments associated with the company s insurance resources does not coincide with future cash flows 
the company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its currently anticipated business requirements over the next twelve months including the funding of discontinued operations  working capital requirements  and capital investments 
balance sheet total investments  net of amounts due to from brokers  increased  to  at december  from  at december   primarily due to a decrease in unrealized losses due to a recovery of fixed income securities in the financial markets 
the  increase in total stockholders equity is primarily due to a decrease of  in unrealized losses and net income of  generated during the company had receivables from reinsurers of  at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from related parties  highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at december  asset quality and investment impairments the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations  which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
although the company s gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities totaled  at december   approximately of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average aa 
the company marks all of its available for sale securities to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
these investments tend to carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december   approximately or  of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in non investment grade fixed maturities primarily mortgage securities investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the increase in non investment grade securities is primarily due to the downgrades in credit ratings of certain alt a mortgage securities 
the company does not have any non performing fixed maturity investments at december  at december   the company had  invested in whole loan cmos backed by alt a mortgages 
of this amount  were in cmos that originated in or earlier and were in cmos that originated in or later 
the company s mortgage security portfolio has no direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the unrealized losses for the equity securities was primarily due to wider spreads from preferred stocks issued by financial institutions following the disruption in credit markets since the time of their acquisition 
some of these financial institutions have exposure to sub prime mortgages 
approximately of fixed maturities  primarily municipal obligations  in our investment portfolio are insured by financial guaranty insurance companies 
the purpose of this insurance is to increase the credit quality of the fixed maturities and their credit ratings 
if the obligations of these financial guarantors ceased to be valuable  either through a credit rating downgrade or default  these debt securities would likely receive lower credit ratings by the rating agencies that would reflect the creditworthiness of the various obligors as if the fixed maturities were uninsured 
the following table summarizes the credit quality of our fixed maturity portfolio as rated  and as rated if the fixed maturities were uninsured  at december bond ratings as rated if uninsured aaa aa a bbb total investment grade bb or lower total fixed maturities changes in interest rates  credit spreads  and investment quality ratings may cause the market value of the company s investments to fluctuate 
the company does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the company will have to sell debt securities in unrealized loss positions that are not other than temporarily impaired before recovery 
in the event that the company s liquidity needs require the sale of fixed maturity securities in unfavorable interest rate  liquidity or credit spread environments  the company may realize investment losses 
the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments as discussed in note j vi of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for and  the company recorded a realized loss of and  respectively  for other than temporary impairments 
the following table summarizes the carrying value of securities with fair values less than of their amortized cost at december  by the length of time the fair values of those securities were below of their amortized cost in thousands greater than greater than months  months  less than less than less than greater than months months months months total fixed maturities equity securities total the unrealized losses on all remaining available for sale securities have been evaluated in accordance with the company s impairment policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  in  the company experienced a decrease in net unrealized losses of  net of the net cumulative effect adjustment of  for the adoption of recent investment accounting pronouncements  which increased stockholders equity by  reflecting net unrealized losses of  at december  compared to net unrealized losses of  at december  
from time to time  as warranted  the company may employ investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
further deterioration in credit quality of the companies backing the securities  further deterioration in the condition of the financial services industry  a continuation of the current imbalances in liquidity that exist in the marketplace  a continuation or worsening of the current economic recession  or additional declines in real estate values may further affect the fair value of these securities and increase the potential that certain unrealized losses be designated as other than temporary in future periods and the company may incur additional write downs 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company performed its annual test at december  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
no impairment charge was required for as fair value exceeded carrying value by more than 
any impairment write down of goodwill would be charged to expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in determining the fair value of each reporting unit  we used an income approach  applying a discounted cash flow method which included a residual value 
based on historical experience  we made assumptions as to i expected future performance and future economic conditions  ii projected operating earnings  iii projected new and renewal business as well as profit margins on such business  and iv a discount rate that incorporated an appropriate risk level for the reporting unit 
management uses a significant amount of judgment in estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the key assumptions underlying the fair value process are subject to uncertainty and change 
the following represent some of the potential risks that could impact these assumptions and the related expected future cash flows i increased competition  ii an adverse change in the insurance industry and overall business climate  iii changes in state and federal regulations  iv rating agency downgrades of our insurance companies  and v a sustained and significant decrease in our share price and market capitalization 
as a result of the global economic crisis that began in  we experienced a significant decline in our stock price 
due to this significant decline  our market capitalization as of december  and was significantly below the sum of our reporting units fair values 
if we experience a sustained decline in our results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  we may incur a material non cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results 
capital resources as independence american s total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital  the company remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
outlook independence american independence american  which is domiciled in delaware  is licensed to write property and or casualty insurance in states and the district of columbia  and has an a excellent rating from am best company  inc am best 
an am best rating is assigned after an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company s financial condition and operating performance  and is also based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  and intermediaries  and is not directed towards protection of investors 
am best ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities of the company 
since its acquisition by amic in  independence american s primary source of revenue has been reinsurance premiums 
we are beginning to become less dependent on reinsurance premiums as we increased the amount of business written by independence american 
during  independence american wrote group major medical  medical stop loss  major medical plans for individuals and families  a small amount of short term medical and dental 
given its a excellent rating from am best  independence american expects to expand the distribution of its products 
in late  independence american appointed a second mgu  which increased the amount of medical stop loss business written by independence american in we continue to seek additional production sources 
with respect to major medical plans for individuals and families  the acquisition of a controlling interest in ipa in  meaningfully increas ed the amount of this line of business written by independence american in ihc treaties with respect to the ihc treaties  the company s operating results are affected by the following factors i the percentage of business ceded to independence american pursuant to the ihc treaties  ii the amount of gross premium written by standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to the ihc treaties  and iii the amount of gross premium produced by the mgus and other distribution sources written by carriers other than standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to independence american 
the profitability of the business ceded will also impact our operating results 
independence american assumes medical stop loss  fully insured health and dbl premiums from ihc under the ihc treaties 
percentage of business ceded in and beyond  the percentage of medical stop loss ceded to independence american will depend on how much ihc determines it has available to reinsure and independence american s desire to reinsure ihc s business 
since the percentage being ceded is now well in excess of the contractual minimum  there is no guarantee that ihc will continue to increase the percentage of business ceded to independence american or  in fact  cede in excess of 
however  our mgus are significant producers of medical stop loss business for ihc 
independence american reinsures of standard security life s dbl product 
standard security life is not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty year 
standard security life and madison national life ceded approximately of their fully insured health business to independence american 
standard security life and madison national life are not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty years 
the company does not expect the percentage ceded to it from ihc will change significantly in the next twelve months 
if independence american  standard security life  and madison national life had agreed to increase the average percentage ceded to independence american by from approximately ceded for the twelve months ended december  and standard security life s and madison national life s gross written premium had remained unchanged  independence american s premium would have increased by approximately million  which is approximately of total net premiums earned for the year ended december  that increase in premium  however  would not have flowed directly to pre tax operating income because of corresponding changes in insurance benefits  claims and reserves and other expenses attributable to the increase in premiums 
amount of premiums written the gross medical stop loss premiums written by ihc decreased in by approximately and such premiums produced by our mgus decreased by approximately in as a result of writing and or renewing fewer policies due to competitors willingness to write business at profit margins lower than those acceptable to the company  partially offset by increased rates on the policies retained 
this resulted in a decrease in the gross amount of premium available to be ceded to independence american in  which decrease could extend into our mgus do not anticipate materially increasing their production of medical stop loss business in ihc has reported that it expects its fully insured premiums to increase slightly and its dbl premiums to decrease slightly in profitability the medical stop loss market is generally cyclical in nature 
when a product experiences several consecutive years of underwriting profitability  it is not unusual for there to be more competitors entering that line which can increase pressure on pricing and create a softer market 
the medical stop loss market began to soften in and less favorable conditions continued through as a result of these market conditions  the rate that the carriers that cede business to the company were able to charge for medical stop loss increased at a lesser rate in recent years although increases in medical trend have also been held in check to a greater extent and deductibles and attachment points have increased 
this reduces the risk taker s overall risk exposure 
marketing agreements in february  independence american entered into an agreement with a marketing organization with a block of fully insured health business primarily sold to small employer groups  and medical stop loss  to begin writing for independence american
