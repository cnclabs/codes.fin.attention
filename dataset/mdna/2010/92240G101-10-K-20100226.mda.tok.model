item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary of consolidated results of operations in this discussion and analysis  the company analyzes contributions to consolidated earnings and earnings per share from its utility group and nonutility group separately since each operates independently requiring distinct competencies and business strategies  offers different energy and energy related products and services  and experiences different opportunities and risks 
nonutility group operations are discussed below as primary operations and other operations 
primary nonutility operations denote areas of management s forward looking focus 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the activities of and revenues and cash flows generated by the nonutility group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
in addition  there are other operations  referred to herein as corporate and other  that include unallocated corporate expenses such as advertising and charitable contributions  among other activities 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
for the year ended december   consolidated net income was million  or per share  compared to earnings of million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in excluding the impact of a charge recorded in discussed below totaling million after tax  or per share  related to proliance s investment in liberty gas storage  for the year ended december   consolidated net income was million  or per share 
utility group results were down only modestly in  even after considering the impacts of the recession  significant cost reductions helped offset those impacts to a large degree 
the nonutility group showed significantly improved performance  particularly in coal mining and retail gas marketing businesses 
charge related to liberty gas storage during the second quarter of  the company recorded its share of the charge related to proliance s investment in liberty gas storage  llc herein referred to as the liberty charge 
in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   the impact associated with the liberty charge is an approximate million reduction to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and an income tax benefit reflected in income taxes of approximately million 
the million after tax  or per share  charge is consistent with previous disclosures about development issues at the louisiana site made in the prior year s annual report 
more detailed information about proliance s investment in liberty is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents consolidated results excluding the liberty charge see page  regarding the use of non gaap measures net income and earnings per share  excluding the liberty charge  in total and by group  for the years ended december    and follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income  excluding liberty charge attributed to utility group nonutility group  excluding liberty charge corporate other basic earnings per share  excluding liberty charge attributed to utility group nonutility group  excluding liberty charge corporate other utility group in  the utility group s earnings were million  compared to earnings of million in and million in the decrease in compared to reflects lower large customer usage and lower wholesale power sales  both due to the recession  mild cooling weather  and an increase in depreciation expense associated with rate base growth 
increased revenues associated with regulatory initiatives  lower operating expenses  and the return of market values associated with investments related benefit plans partially offset these declines 
in compared to  the utility group earnings increased due primarily to a full year of base rate increases in the indiana service territories and increased earnings from wholesale power operations 
increases were offset somewhat by increased operating costs associated with maintenance and reliability programs contemplated in the base rate cases and favorable weather in in the company s electric and the ohio natural gas service territory  which was not fully protected by straight fixed variable rate design in  management estimates the margin impact of weather to be approximately million unfavorable or per share compared to normal temperatures 
in  management estimates a million favorable impact on margin compared to normal or per share  and in a million favorable impact on margin compared to normal or per share 
nonutility group in  nonutility group earnings  excluding the liberty charge  were million  compared to net income of million and million in inclusive of the liberty charge  nonutility group earnings were million 
the improvement of million compared to primarily reflects a million increase in earnings from primary nonutility operations 
primary nonutility business groups are energy marketing and services  coal mining  and energy infrastructure services companies 
coal mining operations has shown improvement due to increased pricing effective january   increasing its contribution to earnings approximately million 
retail gas marketing earnings are million higher than the prior year  and performance contracting activity at esg increased its earnings contribution million compared to these increases were partially offset by lower earnings contributions from proliance and miller pipeline 

table of contents in compared to  primary nonutility group results decreased million 
coal mining operated at a loss and results were approximately million lower than the prior year due primarily to lower production and increased operating costs 
proliance s earnings were million lower than the prior year and reflect lower operating results as well as a reserve for a ferc matter 
in addition  the results from the other primary nonutility operations reflect increased earnings from performance contracting and renewable energy construction operations performed through esg and retail gas marketing operations performed through vectren source 
miller s results were generally flat compared to other nonutility businesses operated at a loss of million in  compared to a loss of million in and earnings of million in other nonutility businesses are legacy investments  including investments in commercial real estate 
the lower results in were driven primarily by a charge associated with commercial real estate investments totaling million  million after tax  or per share 
in  the last year of synfuel operations  synfuel related results generated earnings of million 
of those earnings  million million on a pre tax basis was contributed to the vectren foundation 
net of that contribution  synfuel related results were million  or per share  in the foundation contribution is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december  were per share compared to in and per share in in october  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
the increase marks the th consecutive year vectren and predecessor companies have increased annual dividends paid 
impacts of share issuance in the increased number of common shares outstanding  resulting from the issuance of common shares in  contributed a reduction in earnings per share in compared to and in compared to detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility and nonutility operations 
the detailed results of operations for these operations are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 

table of contents results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of utility holdings operations 
the operations of the utility group consist of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
regulated operations consist of a natural gas distribution business that provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio and an electric transmission and distribution business  which provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and the company s power generating and wholesale power operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to over one million customers 
utility group operating results before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility electric utility other total operating revenues operating expenses cost of gas sold cost of fuel purchased power other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income net interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income contribution to vectren basic eps trends in utility operations utility group margin throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas sold 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel and purchased power costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
rate design strategies sales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are seasonal and are impacted by weather 
trends in average use among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline in recent years as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed and the price of natural gas has been volatile 
normal temperature adjustment nta and lost margin recovery mechanisms largely mitigate the effect on gas utility margin that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns 
indiana gas territory has both an nta since and lost margin recovery since sigeco s natural gas territory has an nta since and lost margin recovery since the ohio service territory had lost margin recovery since the ohio lost margin recovery mechanism ended when new base rates went into effect in february this mechanism was replaced by a rate design  commonly referred to as a straight fixed variable rate design  which is more dependent on monthly service charge revenues and less dependent on volumetric revenues than previous rate designs 
this new rate design  which will be fully implemented in february  will mitigate most weather risk in ohio 
sigeco s electric service territory has neither nta nor lost margin recovery mechanisms  however  rate designs proposed in a recently filed rate case requests a lost margin recovery mechanism that works in tandem with conservation initiatives  similar to rate designs undertaken in the indiana gas service territories 

table of contents tracked operating expenses margin is also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which fluctuate with gas and fuel costs  as well as other tracked expenses 
expenses subject to tracking mechanisms include ohio uncollectible accounts expense and percent of income payment plan expenses  costs associated with exiting the merchant function and to perform service riser replacement in ohio  indiana gas pipeline integrity management costs  costs to fund indiana energy efficiency programs  miso transmission revenues and costs  as well as the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense based on historical experience and unaccounted for gas 
unaccounted for gas is also tracked in the ohio service territory 
certain operating costs  including depreciation  associated with operating environmental compliance equipment at electric generation facilities and regional electric transmission investments are also tracked 
recessionary impacts gas and electric margin generated from sales to large customers generally industrial and other contract customers is primarily impacted by overall economic conditions and changes in demand for those customers products 
the recent recession has had and may continue to have some negative impact on sales to and usage by both gas and electric large customers 
this impact has included  and may continue to include  tempered growth  significant conservation measures  and increased plant closures and bankruptcies 
while no one industrial customer comprises percent of consolidated revenues  the top five industrial electric customers comprise approximately percent of electric utility margin for the year ended december   and therefore any significant decline in their collective margin could adversely impact operating results 
deteriorating economic conditions may also lead to continued lower residential and commercial customer counts 
further  resulting from the lower power prices  decreased demand for electricity and higher coal prices associated with contracts negotiated last year  the company s coal fired generation has been dispatched less often by the miso 
this has resulted in lower wholesale sales  more power being purchased from the miso for native load requirements  and larger coal inventories 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 
gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions gas utility revenues cost of gas sold total gas utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers other sold transported volumes in mmdth attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers total sold transported volumes 
table of contents for the year ended december   gas utility margins were million  a slight decrease of million  compared to management estimates a million year over year decrease in industrial customer margin associated with lower volumes sold  and slightly lower residential and commercial customer counts decreased margin approximately million 
these recessionary impacts were offset by margin associated with regulatory initiatives 
among all customer classes  margin increases associated with regulatory initiatives  including the full impact of the vectren north base rate increase effective in february and the vectren ohio base rate increase effective february  were million year over year 
the impact of operating costs  including revenue and usage taxes  recovered in margin was unfavorable million year over year  reflecting lower revenue taxes offset by higher pass through operating expenses 
the remaining decrease primarily relates to ohio weather and lower miscellaneous revenues associated with reconnection fees 
the lower fees as well as the lower revenue and usage taxes correlate with lower year over year gas costs 
the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased during was compared to in and in for the year ended december   gas utility margins increased million compared to regulatory initiatives  including the vectren north base rate increase  effective february and the vectren south base rate case effective august  added million in margin 
in  ohio weather was percent colder than the prior year and resulted in an estimated increase in margin of approximately million compared to operating costs  including revenue and usage taxes  recovered in margin  increased gas margin million 
electric utility margin electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power electric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows year ended december  in millions electric utility revenues cost of fuel purchased power total electric utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other customers subtotal retail wholesale margin total electric utility margin electric volumes sold in gwh attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other total retail firm wholesale volumes sold retail electric retail utility margin was million for the year ended december   and compared to increased million 
increased margin among the customer classes associated with returns on pollution control equipment and other investments totaled million year over year  and margin associated with tracked costs such as recovery of miso and pollution control operating expenses increased million 
management estimates weather  driven primarily by cooling weather percent milder than the prior year  decreased residential and commercial margin million compared to industrial margins  net of the impacts of regulatory initiatives and recovery of tracked costs  decreased approximately million due primarily to the weak economy 
the industrial decreases are due primarily to lower usage  however  usage began to stabilize during the third and fourth quarters 

table of contents electric retail utility margin was million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million compared to the base rate increase that went into effect on august   produced incremental margin of million year over year when netted with municipal contracts that were allowed to expire 
management estimates the year over year decreases in usage by residential and commercial customers due to weather  which was very warm the prior summer  to be million 
other usage declines due in part to a weakening economy and conservation measures were the primary reason for the remaining decrease 
margin from wholesale electric activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of native load 
the company markets and sells this unutilized generating and transmission capacity to optimize the return on its owned assets 
a majority of the margin generated from these activities is associated with wholesale off system sales  and substantially all off system sales occur into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
further detail of wholesale activity follows year ended december  in millions off system sales transmission system sales total wholesale margin for the year ended december   wholesale margin was million  representing a decrease of million  compared to of the decrease  million relates to lower margin retained by the company from off system sales 
the company experienced lower wholesale power marketing margins due primarily to lower demand and wholesale prices due to the recession  coupled with increased coal costs 
during  margin from off system sales retained by the company increased million  compared to  due to an increase in off peak volumes available for sale off system 
this increase in volumes was driven primarily by expiring municipal contracts and increases in wholesale prices 
off system sales totaled gwh in  compared to  gwh in and gwh in the base rate increase effective august   requires that wholesale margin from off system sales earned above or below million be shared equally with customers as measured on a fiscal year ending in august 
results in and reflect the impact of that sharing 
beginning in june  the company began earning a return on electric transmission projects constructed by the company in its service territory that meet the criteria of miso s regional transmission expansion plans 
margin associated with these projects and other transmission system operations increased million in compared to these returns also primarily account for the million increase in transmission system sales in compared to purchased power the company s mix of generated and purchased electricity changed during compared to prior years 
for the years ended december    and  respectively  the company purchased approximately  gwh  gwh  and gwh of power from the miso and other sources 
the total cost associated with these volumes of purchased power is approximately million  million  and million in   and respectively  and is included in the cost of fuel purchased power 
utility group operating expenses other operating for year ended december   other operating expenses were million  increasing million compared to approximately million of the change results from increased costs directly recovered through utility margin 
examples of such tracked costs include ohio uncollectible accounts expense  indiana gas pipeline integrity management costs  costs to fund indiana energy efficiency programs  and miso transmission revenues and costs  among others 
increases in other operating expenses in  not directly recovered in margin  include an approximate million increase for certain compensation costs and a million increase associated with environmental matters 
all other operating expenses were approximately million lower than the prior year driven primarily by reductions in electric maintenance costs and lower chemical costs 
despite significantly lower gas costs due to the recession  indiana uncollectible accounts expense was only slightly favorable compared to 
table of contents for the year ended december   other operating expenses were million  which represents an increase of million  compared to costs in resulting from increased maintenance and other reliability activities  including amortization of prior deferred costs contemplated in base rate increases  increased approximately million year over year 
operating costs that are directly recovered in utility margin increased million year over year 
costs associated with lower performance compensation and share based compensation and other cost reductions partially offset these increases 
depreciation amortization in  depreciation amortization expense increased million compared to the increase in depreciation is due largely to plant additions 
plant additions include the approximate million so scrubber placed into service january   for which depreciation totaling million is directly recovered in electric utility margin 
depreciation expense increased million in compared to expense in includes million of increased amortization associated with prior electric demand side management costs to be recovered pursuant to the august  electric base rate order 
the remaining increases are also attributable to increased utility plant in service 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes decreased million in compared to and increased million in compared to these taxes are primarily revenue related taxes 
the variations are primarily attributable to volatility in revenues  inclusive of changes in natural gas prices and gas volumes sold 
these tax expenses are recovered through revenue 
other income net other income net reflects income of in  compared to million in and million in the variations are primarily due to volatile market values associated with investments related to benefit plans 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense was million  which represents a slight decrease of million compared to lower short term interest rates and lower average short term debt balances have favorably affected interest expense year over year and are reflective of lower gas prices and the issuance of new long term debt 
offsetting the favorable impacts of lower rates and short term balances is the impact of two long term financing transactions completed in the long term financing transactions include a second quarter issuance by utility holdings of million in unsecured eleven year notes with an interest rate of percent and a third quarter completion by sigeco of a million debt issuance of year tax exempt first mortgage bonds with an interest rate of percent 
for the year ended december   interest expense was million  a decrease of million compared to  as lower average short term debt levels and lower average short term interest rates were partially offset by higher long term balances and interest rates 
income taxes federal and state income taxes decreased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the changes are impacted primarily by fluctuations in pre tax income and lower effective tax rates 
the lower effective tax rate in results from more taxable income allocated to states with low  or no  state income taxes 

table of contents environmental matters clean air act the clean air interstate rule cair is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions from coal burning power plants in nox emissions beginning january  and so emissions beginning january   with a second phase of reductions in on july   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the federal cair regulations 
various parties filed motions for reconsideration  and on december   the court reinstated the cair regulations and remanded the regulations back to the usepa for promulgation of revisions in accordance with the court s july  order 
thus  the original version of cair promulgated in march of remains effective while usepa revises it per the court s guidance 
sigeco is in compliance with the current cair phase i annual nox reduction requirements in effect on january  and is also in compliance with so reductions effective january  it is possible that a revised cair will require further reductions in nox and so from sigeco s generating units 
utilization of the company s inventory of nox and so allowances may also be impacted if cair is further revised  however  most of these allowances were granted to the company at zero cost  so these changes will not impact the carrying value 
similarly  in march of  usepa promulgated the clean air mercury rule camr 
camr is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in mercury emissions from coal burning power plants 
the camr regulations were vacated by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in july in response to the court decision  usepa has announced that it intends to publish proposed maximum achievable control technology standards for mercury in it is uncertain what emission limit the usepa is considering  and whether they will address hazardous pollutants in addition to mercury 
it is also possible that the vacatur of the camr regulations will lead to increased support for the passage of a multi pollutant bill in congress 
to comply with indiana s implementation plan of the clean air act of  the cair regulations  and to comply with potential future regulations of mercury and further nox and so reductions  sigeco has iurc authority to invest in clean coal technology 
using this authorization  sigeco has invested approximately million in pollution control equipment  including selective catalytic reduction scr systems and fabric filters 
scr technology is the most effective method of reducing nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required and fabric filters control particulate matter emissions 
these investments were included in rate base for purposes of determining new base rates that went into effect on august  prior to being included in base rates  return on investments made and recovery of related operating expenses were recovered through a rider mechanism 
further  the iurc granted sigeco authority to invest in an so scrubber at its generating facility that is jointly owned with alcoa the company s portion is mw 
the order allows sigeco to recover an approximate percent return on capital investments through a rider mechanism  which is periodically updated for actual costs incurred less post in service depreciation expense 
the company has invested approximately million in this project 
the scrubber was placed into service on january  recovery through a rider mechanism of associated operating expenses including depreciation expense associated with the scrubber also began on january  the so scrubber is in compliance with the additional so reductions required by phase i cair commencing on january  sigeco s coal fired generating fleet is percent scrubbed for so and percent controlled for nox 
sigeco s investments in scrubber  scr and fabric filter technology allows for compliance with existing regulations and should position it to comply with future reasonable pollution control legislation  if and when  reductions in mercury and further reductions in nox and so are promulgated by usepa 
climate change vectren is committed to responsible environmental stewardship and conservation efforts 
while scientific uncertainties exist and the debate surrounding global climate change is ongoing  current information suggests a potential for adverse economic and social consequences should world wide carbon dioxide co and other greenhouse gas emissions continue at present levels 

table of contents the company emits greenhouse gases ghg primarily from its fossil fuel electric generation plants 
the company uses methodology described in the acid rain program under title iv of the clean air act to calculate its level of direct co emissions from its fossil fuel electric generating plants 
the company s direct co emissions from its plants over the past years are represented below in thousands direct co emissions tons the decline in emissions from to is primarily due to recessionary impacts that resulted in a percent decrease in generation 
it is not clear to what extent this recent reduction may continue 
based on data made available through the emissions and generation resource integrated database egrid maintained by the usepa  the company s direct co emissions from its fossil fuel electric generation that report under the acid rain program were less than one half of one percent of all emissions in the united states from similar sources 
emissions from other company operations  including those from its natural gas distribution operations  are monitored internally using the department of energy b standard  and the company is currently assessing how to effectively report these emissions in relation to the new mandatory reporting regulations set forth by the usepa 
the need to reduce co and other greenhouse gas emissions  yet provide affordable energy  requires thoughtful balance 
for these reasons  vectren supports a national climate change policy with the following elements an inclusive scope that involves all sectors of the economy and sources of greenhouse gases  and recognizes early actions and investments made to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions  provisions for enhanced use of renewable energy sources as a supplement to base load coal generation including effective energy conservation  demand side management and generation efficiency measures  a flexible market based cap and trade approach with zero cost allowance allocations to coal fired electric generators 
the approach should have a properly designed economic safety valve in order to reduce or eliminate extreme price spikes and potential price volatility 
a long lead time must be included to align nearer term technology capabilities and expanded generation efficiency and other enhanced renewable strategies  ensuring that generation sources will rely less on natural gas to meet short term carbon reduction requirements 
this new regime should allow for adequate resource and generation planning and remove existing impediments to efficiency enhancements posed by the current new source review provisions of the clean air act  inclusion of incentives for investment in advanced clean coal technology and support for research and development  a strategy supporting alternative energy technologies and biofuels and increasing the domestic supply of natural gas to reduce dependence on foreign oil and imported natural gas  and the allocation of zero cost allowances to natural gas distribution companies if those companies are required to hold allowances for the benefit of the end use customer 
current initiatives to increase conservation reduce emissions the company is committed to a policy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy usage 
evidence of this commitment includes focusing the company s mission statement and purpose on corporate sustainability and the need to help customers conserve and manage energy costs  building a renewable energy portfolio to complement base load coal fired generation in advance of mandated renewable energy portfolio standards  implementing conservation initiatives in the company s indiana and ohio gas utility service territories  participation in an electric conservation and demand side management collaborative with the oucc and other customer advocate groups  evaluating potential carbon requirements with regard to new generation  other fuel supply sources  and future environmental compliance plans  reducing the company s carbon footprint by measures such as purchasing hybrid vehicles and optimizing generation efficiencies  and developing renewable energy and energy efficiency performance contracting projects through its wholly owned subsidiary  energy systems group 

table of contents legislative actions other climate change initiatives the us house of representatives has passed a comprehensive energy bill that includes a carbon cap and trade program in which there is a progressive cap on greenhouse gas emissions and an auctioning and subsequent trading of allowances among those that emit greenhouse gases  a federal renewable portfolio standard  and utility energy efficiency targets 
current proposed legislation also requires local natural gas distribution companies to hold allowances for the benefit of their customers 
as of the date of this filing  the senate has not passed a bill  and the house bill is not law 
in the absence of federal legislation  several regional initiatives throughout the united states are in the process of establishing regional cap and trade programs 
while no climate change legislation is pending in indiana  the state is an observer to the midwestern regional greenhouse gas reduction accord 
in advance of a federal or state renewable portfolio standard  sigeco received iurc approval to purchase a mw landfill gas generation facility from a related entity 
the facility was purchased in and is directly interconnected to the company s distribution system 
in  the company also executed a long term purchase power commitment for mw of wind energy 
these transactions supplement a mw wind energy purchase power agreement executed in at december   the company s renewable portfolio is approximately percent of total generation sources 
in april of  the us supreme court determined that greenhouse gases meet the definition of air pollutant under the clean air act and ordered the usepa to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare 
in april of  the usepa published its proposed endangerment finding for public comment 
the proposed endangerment finding concludes that carbon emissions from mobile sources pose an endangerment to public health and the environment 
the endangerment finding was finalized in december of  and is the first step toward usepa regulating carbon emissions through the existing clean air act in the absence of specific carbon legislation from congress 
therefore  any new regulations would likely also impact major stationary sources of greenhouse gases 
the usepa has recently finalized a mandatory greenhouse gas emissions registry which will require reporting of emissions beginning in for the emission year 
the usepa has also recently proposed a revision to the psd prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting rules which would require facilities that emit  tons or more of greenhouse gases a year to obtain a psd permit for new construction or a significant modification of an existing facility 
if these proposed rules were adopted  they would apply to sigeco s generating facilities 
impact of legislative actions other initiatives is unknown if legislation requiring reductions in co and other greenhouse gases or legislation mandating a renewable energy portfolio standard is adopted  such regulation could substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of the company s fossil fuel generating plants  nonutility coal mining operations  and natural gas distribution businesses 
further  any legislation would likely impact the company s generation resource planning decisions 
at this time and in the absence of final legislation  compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain 
the company has gathered preliminary estimates of the costs to comply with a cap and trade approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions 
a preliminary investigation demonstrated costs to comply would be significant  first with regard operating expenses for the purchase of allowances  and later for capital expenditures as technology becomes available to control greenhouse gas emissions 
however  these compliance cost estimates are based on highly uncertain assumptions  including allowance prices and energy efficiency targets 
costs to purchase allowances that cap greenhouse gas emissions should be considered a cost of providing electricity and gas  and as such  the company believes recovery should be timely reflected in rates charged to customers 
approximately percent of electric volumes sold in were delivered to municipal and other wholesale customers 
as such  reductions in these volumes in coupled with the flexibility to further modify the level of these transactions in future periods may help with compliance since emission targets are expected to be based on pre levels 
ash ponds coal ash disposal regulations the usepa is considering additional regulatory measures affecting the management and disposal of coal combustion products  such as ash generated by the company s coal fired power plants 
additional laws and regulations under consideration more stringently regulate these byproducts  including the potential for coal ash to be considered a hazardous waste in certain circumstances 
the usepa has indicated that it intends to propose a rule during at this time  the company is unable to predict the outcome any such revised regulations might have on operating results  financial position  or liquidity 

table of contents jacobsville superfund site on july   the usepa listed the jacobsville neighborhood soil contamination site in evansville  indiana  on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the usepa has identified four sources of historic lead contamination 
these four sources shut down manufacturing operations years ago 
when drawing up the boundaries for the listing  the usepa included a acre block of properties surrounding the jacobsville neighborhood  including vectren s wagner operations center 
vectren s property has not been named as a source of the lead contamination 
vectren s own soil testing  completed during the construction of the operations center  did not indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils above industrial cleanup levels 
at this time  it is anticipated that the usepa may request only additional soil testing at some future date 
environmental remediation efforts in the past  indiana gas  sigeco  and others operated facilities for the manufacture of gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under currently applicable environmental laws and regulations  those that owned or operated these facilities may now be required to take remedial action if certain contaminants are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 
indiana gas identified the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites for which it may have some remedial responsibility 
indiana gas completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january indiana gas submitted the remainder of the sites to the idem s voluntary remediation program vrp and is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites  where deemed appropriate  and will continue remedial activities at the sites as appropriate and necessary 
indiana gas accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  indiana gas has recorded cumulative costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to indiana gas share of the remediation efforts 
indiana gas has arrangements in place for of the sites with other potentially responsible parties prp  which limit indiana gas costs at these sites to between percent and percent 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has settled with all known insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these plants were in operation in an aggregate amount approximating million 
in october  sigeco received a formal information request letter from the idem regarding five manufactured gas plants that it owned and or operated and were not enrolled in the idem s vrp 
in october  sigeco filed applications to enter four of the manufactured gas plant sites in idem s vrp 
the remaining site is currently being addressed in the vrp by another indiana utility 
sigeco added those four sites into the renewal of the global voluntary remediation agreement that indiana gas has in place with idem for its manufactured gas plant sites 
that renewal was approved by the idem in february sigeco is also named in a lawsuit filed in federal district court in may  involving another waste disposal site subject to potential environmental remediation efforts 
with respect to that lawsuit  in an october court decision  sigeco was found to be a prp at the site 
however  the court must still determine whether such costs should be allocated among a number of prps  including the former owners of the site 
sigeco has filed a declaratory judgment action against its insurance carriers seeking a judgment finding its carriers liable under the policies for coverage of further investigation and any necessary remediation costs that sigeco may accrue under the vrp program and or related to the site subject to the may lawsuit 
sigeco has recorded cumulative costs that it reasonably expects to incur related to these environmental matters totaling approximately million 
however  given the uncertainty surrounding the allocation of prp responsibility associated with the may lawsuit and other matters  the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing all of these sites cannot be determined at this time 
with respect to insurance coverage  sigeco has settled with certain of its known insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these sites were in operation in an aggregate amount of million  negotiations are ongoing with others 
total costs expected to be incurred are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred  the timing of expected future payments  and inflation factors  among others 
while the company s utilities have recorded all costs which they presently expect to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen and those costs may not be subject to prp or insurance recovery 
as of december  and december   approximately million of accrued  but not yet spent  remediation costs are included in other liabilities related to both the indiana gas and sigeco sites 

table of contents rate regulatory matters gas and electric operations with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  issuance of securities  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of the ohio operations are subject to regulation by the puco 
gas rates in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause 
the gca clause allows the company to charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas 
electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to a variable benchmark based on nymex natural gas prices  is also recovered through regulatory proceedings 
the iurc approved agreement authorizing this recovery expires in april  and is subject to automatic annual renewals 
gca and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between the estimated cost of gas  cost of fuel  and net energy cost of purchased power and actual costs incurred 
the company records any under or over recovery resulting from gas and fuel adjustment clauses each month in margin 
a corresponding asset or liability is recorded until the under or over recovery is billed or refunded to utility customers 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
these earnings tests have not had any material impact to the company s recent operating results 
prior to october   gas costs were recovered in ohio through a gas cost recovery gcr clause 
the gcr clause operated similar to the gca clause in indiana 
the puco periodically audited the gcr rates 
the puco has completed all audits of periods prior to october  and no issues or findings are outstanding 
after october   the company is no longer the supplier  and the gcr is no longer necessary 
vectren south electric base rate filing on december   the company filed a request with the iurc to adjust its electric base rates in its south service territory 
the requested increase in base rates addresses capital investments  a modified electric rate design that facilitates a partnership between the company and customers to pursue energy efficiency and conservation  and new energy efficiency programs to complement those currently offered for natural gas customers 
in total the request approximated million 
the request addresses the roughly million spent in infrastructure construction since its last base rate increase in august that was needed to continue to provide reliable service 
most of the remainder of the request is to account for the now lower overall sales levels resulting from the recession 
a portion of the request reflects a slight increase in annual operating and maintenance costs since the last rate case  nearly four years ago 
the rate design proposed in the filing would break the link between customers consumption and the utility s rate of return  thereby aligning the utility s and customers interests in using less energy 
the request assumes an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately  million and an allowed return on equity roe of percent 
based upon timelines prescribed by the iurc at the start of these proceedings  a decision is expected to be issued at the end of vedo gas base rate order received on january   the puco issued an order approving the stipulation reached in the vedo rate case 
the order provides for a rate increase of nearly million  an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of about million  an opportunity to recover costs of a program to accelerate replacement of cast iron and bare steel pipes  as well as certain service risers  and base rate recovery of an additional million in conservation program spending 

table of contents the order also adjusted the rate design used to collect the agreed upon revenue from vedo s customers 
the order allows for the phased movement toward a straight fixed variable rate design which places substantially all of the fixed cost recovery in the customer service charge 
a straight fixed variable design mitigates most weather risk as well as the effects of declining usage  similar to the company s lost margin recovery mechanism  which expired when this new rate design went into effect on february  in  annual results include approximately million of revenue from a lost margin recovery mechanism that did not continue once this base rate increase went into effect 
after year one  nearly percent of the combined residential and commercial base rate margins were recovered through the customer service charge 
the occ has filed a request for rehearing on the rate design finding by the puco 
the rehearing request mirrors similar requests filed by the occ in each case where the puco has approved similar rate designs 
the ohio supreme court has yet to act on the occ s request in this instance  but in two similar cases  the court denied such requests 
with this rate order the company has in place for its ohio gas territory rates that allow for the phased implementation of a straight fixed variable rate design that mitigates both weather risk and lost margin  tracking of uncollectible accounts and percent of income payment plan pipp expenses  base rate recovery of pipeline integrity management expense  timely recovery of costs associated with the accelerated replacement of bare steel and cast iron pipes  as well as certain service risers  and expanded conservation programs now totaling up to million in annual expenditures 
the straight fixed variable rate design will be fully phased in by february vedo continues the process to exit the merchant function on august   the puco approved an auction selecting qualified wholesale suppliers to provide the gas commodity to the company for resale to its customers at auction determined standard pricing 
this standard pricing is comprised of the monthly nymex settlement price plus a fixed adder 
this auction  which is effective from october  through march   is the initial step in exiting the merchant function in the company s ohio service territory 
the approach eliminated the need for monthly gas cost recovery gcr filings and prospective puco gcr audits 
in october  vedo s entire natural gas inventory was transferred  receiving proceeds of approximately million 
the second phase of the exit process begins on april   during which the company will no longer sell natural gas directly to these customers 
rather  state certified competitive retail natural gas suppliers  that are successful bidders in a second regulatory approved auction  will sell the gas commodity to specific customers for months at auction determined standard pricing 
that auction was conducted on january   and the auction results were approved by the puco on january the plan approved by the puco requires that the company conduct at least two auctions during this phase 
as such  the company will conduct another auction in advance of the second month term  which will commence on april  consistent with current practice  customers will continue to receive one bill for the delivery of natural gas service 
the puco has also provided for an exit transition cost rider  which allows the company to recover costs associated with the transition 
as the cost of gas is currently passed through to customers through a puco approved recovery mechanism  the impact of exiting the merchant function should not have a material impact on company earnings or financial condition 
vectren north gas base rate order received on february   the company received an order from the iurc which approved the settlement agreement reached in its vectren north gas rate case 
the order provided for a base rate increase of million and a return on equity roe of percent  with an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately million 
the order also provides for the recovery of million of costs through separate cost recovery mechanisms rather than base rates 
further  additional expenditures for a multi year bare steel and cast iron capital replacement program will be afforded certain accounting treatment that mitigates earnings attrition from the investment between rate cases 
the accounting treatment allows for the continuation of the accrual for afudc and the deferral of depreciation expense after the projects go in service but before they are included in base rates 
to qualify for this treatment  the annual expenditures are limited to million and the treatment cannot extend beyond four years on each project 
with this order  the company has in place for its north gas territory weather normalization  a conservation and lost margin recovery tariff  tracking of gas cost expense related to a uncollectible accounts expense level based on historical experience and unaccounted for gas through the existing gca mechanism  and tracking of pipeline integrity management expense 
vectren south gas base rate order received on august   the company received an order from the iurc which approved the settlement reached in vectren south s gas rate case 
the order provided for a base rate increase of million and a roe of percent  with an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately million 
the order also provided for the recovery of million of costs through separate cost recovery mechanisms rather than base rates 
further  additional expenditures for a multi year bare steel and cast iron capital replacement program will be afforded certain accounting treatment that mitigates earnings attrition from the investment between rate cases 
the accounting treatment allows for the continuation of the accrual for afudc and the deferral of depreciation expense after the projects go in service but before they are included in base rates 
to qualify for this treatment  the annual expenditures are limited to million and the treatment cannot extend beyond three years on each project 
with this order  the company now has in place for its south gas territory weather normalization  a conservation and lost margin recovery tariff  tracking of gas cost expense related to a uncollectible accounts expense level based on historical experience and unaccounted for gas through the existing gas cost adjustment mechanism  and tracking of pipeline integrity management expense 
vectren south electric base rate order received in august  the company received an order from the iurc which approved the settlement reached in vectren south s electric rate case 
the order provided for an approximate million electric rate increase to cover the company s cost of system growth  maintenance  safety and reliability 
the order provided for  among other things recovery of ongoing costs and deferred costs associated with the miso  operations and maintenance o m expense increases related to managing the aging workforce  including the development of expanded apprenticeship programs and the creation of defined training programs to ensure proper knowledge transfer  safety and system stability  increased o m expense necessary to maintain and improve system reliability  benefit to customers from the sale of wholesale power by vectren sharing equally with customers any profit earned above or below million of wholesale power margin  recovery of and return on the investment in past demand side management programs to help encourage conservation during peak load periods  timely recovery of the company s investment in certain new electric transmission projects that benefit the miso infrastructure  an overall rate of return of percent on rate base of approximately  million and an allowed roe of percent 
miso since and with the iurc s approval  the company has been a member of the miso  a ferc approved regional transmission organization 
the miso serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midwest and maintains operational control over the company s electric transmission facilities as well as that of other midwest utilities 
since april   the company has been an active participant in the miso energy markets  bidding its owned generation into the day ahead and real time markets and procuring power for its retail customers at locational marginal pricing lmp as determined by the miso market 
historically  the company has typically been in a net sales position with miso as generation capacity is in excess of that needed to serve native load and is from time to time in a net purchase position 
when the company is a net seller such net revenues are included in electric utility revenues and when the company is a net purchaser such net purchases are included in cost of fuel purchased power 
net positions are determined on an hourly basis 
since the company became an active miso member  its generation optimization strategies primarily involve the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
the company also has municipal customers served through the miso and for which the company transmits power to the miso for delivery to those customers 
net revenues from wholesale activities  inclusive of revenues associated with these municipal contracts  totaled million in  million in  and million in the base rate case effective august   requires that wholesale margin net revenues less the cost of fuel purchased power inclusive of this miso wholesale activity earned above or below million be shared equally with retail customers as measured on a fiscal year ending in august 
recently  miso market prices have fallen and the company has more frequently been a net purchaser 
in addition  the company also receives power through the miso associated with its wind and other power purchase agreements 
including these power purchase agreements  the company purchased energy from the miso totaling million in  million in  and million in to the extent these power purchases are used for retail load  they are subject to fac filings 
the company also receives transmission revenue that results from other miso members use of the company s transmission system 
these revenues are also included in electric utility revenues 
generally  these transmission revenues along with costs charged by the miso are considered components of base rates and any variance from that included in base rates is recovered from refunded to retail customers through tracking mechanisms 
as a result of miso s operational control over much of the midwestern electric transmission grid  including sigeco s transmission facilities  sigeco s continued ability to import power  when necessary  and export power to the wholesale market has been  and may continue to be  impacted 
given the nature of miso s policies regarding use of transmission facilities  as well as ongoing ferc initiatives  and a day ancillary services market asm  where miso began providing a bid based regulation and contingency operating reserve markets on january   it is difficult to predict near term operational impacts 
the iurc has approved the company s participation in the asm and has granted authority to recover costs associated with asm 
to date impacts from the asm have been minor 
the need to expend capital for improvements to the regional transmission system  both to sigeco s facilities as well as to those facilities of adjacent utilities  over the next several years is expected to be significant 
beginning in june  the company began timely recovering its investment in certain new electric transmission projects that benefit the miso regional infrastructure at a ferc approved rate of return 
such revenues recorded in electric utility revenues associated with projects meeting the criteria of miso s transmission expansion plans totaled million in and million in one such project currently under construction is an interstate kilovolt transmission line that will connect vectren s ab brown generating station to a station in indiana owned by duke energy to the north and to a station in kentucky owned by big rivers electric corporation to the south 
throughout the project  sigeco is to recover an approximate percent return  inclusive of the ferc approved equity rate of return of percent  on capital investments through a rider mechanism which is updated annually for estimated costs to be incurred 
of the total investment  which is expected to approximate million  as of december   the company has invested approximately million 
the company expects this project to be fully operational in at that time  any operating expenses including depreciation expense are also expected to be recovered through a ferc approved rider mechanism 
further  the approval allows for recovery of expenditures made even in the event currently unforeseen difficulties delay or permanently halt the project 
results of operations of the nonutility group the nonutility group operates in three primary business areas energy marketing and services  coal mining  and energy infrastructure services 
energy marketing and services markets and supplies natural gas and provides energy management services 
coal mining mines and sells coal 
energy infrastructure services provides underground construction and repair and provides performance contracting and renewable energy services 
there are also other legacy businesses that have invested in energy related opportunities and services  real estate  and leveraged leases  among other investments 
the nonutility group supports the company s regulated utilities pursuant to service contracts by providing natural gas supply services  coal  and infrastructure services 
nonutility group earnings for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share amounts net income excluding liberty charge contribution to vectren basic eps  excluding liberty charge net income attributed to energy marketing services excluding liberty charge mining operations energy infrastructure services other businesses synfuels related including the liberty charge of million after tax  the nonutility group generated net income of million for the year ended december 
table of contents impact of the recent recession despite the beginning of recovery  the recent recession has resulted in  and may continue to result in  a lower level of economic activity and greater uncertainty regarding energy prices and other key factors that impact the nonutility group 
economic declines have been accompanied by a decrease in demand for products and services offered by nonutility operations 
the recent recession has had  and may continue to have  some negative impact on utility industry spending for construction projects  demand for coal  and spending on performance contracting and renewable energy expansion 
it is also possible that if a weak economy continues  there could be further reductions in the value of certain nonutility real estate and other legacy investments 
energy marketing services energy marketing and services is comprised of the company s gas marketing operations  energy management services  and retail gas supply operations 
operating entities contributing to these results include proliance and vectren source 
results  inclusive of holding company costs but excluding the liberty charge of million after tax  from energy marketing and services for the year ended december   were earnings of million  compared to million in and million in proliance proliance  a nonutility energy marketing affiliate of vectren and citizens  provides services to a broad range of municipalities  utilities  industrial operations  schools  and healthcare institutions located throughout the midwest and southeast united states 
proliance s customers include vectren s indiana utilities and nonutility gas supply operations and citizens utilities 
proliance s primary businesses include gas marketing  gas portfolio optimization  and other portfolio and energy management services 
consistent with its ownership percentage  vectren is allocated percent of proliance s profits and losses  however  governance and voting rights remain at percent for each member  and therefore  the company accounts for its investment in proliance using the equity method of accounting 
vectren received regulatory approval on april   from the iurc for proliance to continue to provide natural gas supply services to the company s indiana utilities through march for the year ended december    and  the amounts recorded to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates related to proliance s operations  excluding the liberty charge  totaled income of million  million  and million  respectively 
vectren energy marketing and services  inc ems  a wholly owned subsidiary  holds the company s investment in proliance 
within the consolidated entity  ems is responsible for certain financing costs associated with proliance and is also responsible for income taxes related to the company s portion of proliance s results 
during the year ended december   proliance s earnings  inclusive of financing costs and income taxes  were approximately million compared to million in and million in during  proliance s earnings contribution decreased million compared to the decrease primarily reflects lower cash to nymex spreads compared to the prior year  particularly spreads existing in the third quarter of that had unprecedented price volatility and resulted in record quarterly earnings from proliance 
proliance s earnings contribution decreased million in compared to and is reflective of lower operating results 
proliance s storage capacity at december  is bcf compared to bcf at december  and bcf at december  investment in liberty gas storage liberty gas storage  llc liberty  a joint venture between a subsidiary of proliance and a subsidiary of sempra energy se  is a development project for salt cavern natural gas storage facilities 
proliance is the minority member with a percent interest  which it accounts for using the equity method 
the project was expected to include bcf of capacity in its north facility previously referred to as the sulfur site  located near sulfur  louisiana  and an additional bcf of capacity in its south facility previously referred to as the hackberry site  near hackberry  louisiana 
as more fully described below  it is now expected that only the south facility will be completed by the joint venture 
this facility is expected to provide at least bcf of capacity 
the liberty pipeline system is currently connected with several interstate pipelines  including the cameron interstate pipeline operated by sempra pipelines storage  and will connect area lng regasification terminals to an interstate natural gas transmission system and storage facilities 
proliance s investment in liberty is million at december   after reflecting the charge discussed below 

table of contents in late  se advised proliance that the completion of the phase of liberty s development at the north site had been delayed by subsurface and well completion problems 
based on testing performed in the second quarter of  se determined that attempts at corrective measures had been unsuccessful in development of certain caverns 
at june   liberty recorded a charge of approximately million to write off the north caverns and certain related assets 
as an equity investor in liberty  proliance recorded its share of the charge  totaling million at june  the company s share is million after tax  or per share 
in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   the charge is an approximate million reduction to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and an income tax benefit reflected in income taxes of approximately million 
the company and proliance do not expect issues associated with liberty to impact future liquidity or access to capital 
further  it is not expected that the delay in liberty s development will impact proliance s ability to meet the needs of its customers 
regulatory matter resolved proliance self reported to the ferc in october possible non compliance with the ferc s capacity release policies 
proliance has taken corrective actions to assure that current and future transactions are compliant 
during the second quarter of  proliance resolved the matter with ferc 
the amount of the penalty was not material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
vectren source vectren source  a wholly owned subsidiary  provides natural gas and other related products and services to customers opting for choice among energy providers 
vectren source earned approximately million in  compared to million in and million in the record earnings in resulted primarily from favorable market conditions over the course of s first quarter as revenues on variable priced sales contracts fell more slowly than gas costs 
results in were impacted by a million gain on the sale of its georgia customer base 
vectren source s customer count at december  was approximately  equivalent customers  compared to  at december  and  at december  this customer base reflects nearly  equivalent customers in vedo s service territory as part of vedo s process of exiting the merchant function 
vectren source began providing services to these vedo customers on october  this service will end march  vectren source was a successful bidder in the second regulatory approved auction that was conducted on january  related to vedo s exit the merchant function 
as a result of this auction  vectren source will sell gas commodity directly to approximately  equivalent customers in vedo s service territory through april  coal mining coal mining mines and sells coal to the company s utility operations and to third parties through its wholly owned subsidiary vectren fuels  inc vectren fuels 
coal mining  inclusive of holding company costs  earned approximately million in  compared to a loss of million in and earnings of million in compared to  coal mining earnings have increased based on new contract pricing effective january  the impact of higher revenues has been somewhat offset by increased costs per ton mined and the recession 
the anticipated cost increase was reflective of efforts to reconfigure the mining operation at prosperity mine in order to improve future productivity and meet mine safety and health administration msha requirements 
during the second half of  these improvements began to favorably impact production and operating costs 
the recent recession resulted in a decrease in the demand for  and market price of  illinois basin coal and lower than anticipated earnings from coal mining operations 
the lowered demand has caused some build up of coal inventory at most customer locations as well as at vectren fuels mines 
as a result of contracts with minimum delivery provisions  certain customers scaled back their deliveries within specified limits 
this resulted in less mine production as vectren fuels reduced production to align with customer s needs 
further  vectren fuels is currently in a dispute with one customer regarding its purchase contract  and vectren fuels is working to resolve the dispute 
in the current market conditions  vectren fuels sold million tons in compared to million tons in and million tons in the original expectation for was to sell between and million tons 
further  the higher customer coal inventory levels will likely cause the current demand and supply imbalance to extend into early has shown some decline in customer inventory levels  due largely to colder weather and the resulting increased demand 

table of contents the decrease in earnings in compared to was primarily due to lower production and increased roofing structure costs as a result of revised msha regulatory guidelines which necessitated changes to the mining plan 
as a result  the yield at the prosperity mine decreased approximately percent in compared to in addition  was impacted by higher diesel fuel costs and unfavorable geologic conditions at the company s surface mine  which resulted in more costs to enhance the btu content of mined coal 
oaktown mines the first of two new underground mines located near vincennes  indiana  which began minor coal extraction in the latter half of  is now operational 
the second mine is currently expected to open in however  vectren fuels may continue to change this time table as it evaluates the impacts of current market conditions 
reserves at the two mines are estimated at about million tons of recoverable number five coal at  btu and less than pound sulfur dioxide 
the reserves at these new mines bring total coal reserves to approximately million tons at december  once in production  the two new mines are capable of producing about million tons of coal per year 
due to the delay in the opening of the mines  management expects to incur approximately million to access the coal reserves 
at december   vectren fuels has invested approximately million in the new mines 
energy infrastructure services energy infrastructure services provides energy performance contracting and renewable energy services through energy systems group  llc esg and underground construction and repair to utility infrastructure through miller pipeline corporation miller 
inclusive of holding company costs  energy infrastructure s operations contributed earnings of million in  compared to million in and million in energy systems group esg s earnings were million in  compared to million in and million in the increases are primarily due to the continued focus on renewable energy  energy conservation  and sustainability measures by esg s customers 
in  the increase is primarily a result of increased performance contracting revenues 
as part of esg s ongoing renewable energy project development strategy  results in include the sale of a mw self developed landfill gas facility 
with approval from the iurc  the facility was sold to sigeco  as part of the utility s strategy to continue to build a renewable energy portfolio 
esg s results associated with this renewable project match the results of a similar land fill gas project completed near atlanta  georgia in at december   esg s backlog was million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the national focus on a comprehensive energy strategy as evidenced by the energy independence and security act of and the american recovery and reinvestment act of is likely to create favorable conditions for esg s growth and resulting earnings 
miller pipeline miller s earnings were million compared to million in and million in the decrease in primarily results from customer cutbacks in spending as a result of the recession 
in addition  startup costs associated with new contracts also negatively impacted year over year results 
lower interest rates partially offset the lower margins 
the years ended december  and were record years in terms of earnings contribution from miller 
as the country continues to replace its aging natural gas infrastructure and needs for shale gas infrastructure become more prevalent  miller is positioned for future growth 
other businesses within the nonutility business segment  there are legacy investments  outside of primary operations  involved in energy related opportunities and services  real estate  leveraged leases  and other ventures  including investments in the haddington energy partnerships haddington 
as of december   remaining legacy investments included in the other businesses portfolio total million  of which million are included in other nonutility investments and million are included in investments in unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated balance sheet 
further separation of that remaining investment by type of investment follows commercial real estate million  haddington million  affordable housing projects million  leveraged leases million  and other investments  including a note receivable from the city of alameda  california  million 
as of december   investments totaled million 

table of contents other businesses reported a loss of million in  compared to a loss of million in and earnings of million in results in reflect a write down associated with commercial real estate investments 
commercial real estate charge the recent economic recession impacted the value of commercial real estate investments within this portfolio  and the prospect for recovery of that value diminished 
during  the company assessed its commercial real estate investments for impairment and identified the need to reduce their carrying values 
the impairment charge totaled million  million after tax  or per basic earnings per share 
of the million charge  million is included in other net and million is included in other operating expenses 
the charge impacted the carrying values of primarily notes receivable collateralized by commercial real estate and an office building of which the company took possession when a leveraged lease expired in and that is currently for sale 
synfuel related activity tax laws authorizing synfuel credits expired on december  prior to that date  the company had active synthetic fuel investments  including an investment in pace carbon synfuels  lp pace carbon 
in addition  vectren fuels generated processing fees from other synfuel producers 
activity since december  has been insignificant and is generally focused on winding down partnership operations at pace carbon 
generally  the statute of limitations for the irs to audit a tax return is three years from filing 
therefore  tax credits generated by the investment in pace carbon and utilized in are still subject to irs examination 
however  avenues remain where the irs could challenge tax credits for the years prior to as a partner of pace carbon  vectren reflected cumulative synfuel tax credits of approximately million in its consolidated results  of which approximately million were generated in and vectren has utilized all of the credits generated 
synfuel tax credits were only available when the price of oil was less than a base price specified by the irc  as adjusted for inflation 
due to high oil prices in  only million of the approximate million in tax credits generated were reflected as a reduction to the company s income tax expense 
the company executed several financial contracts to hedge oil price risk 
income statement activity associated with these contracts was a gain of million in this activity is reflected in other net along with the effects of impairing the pace carbon investment in in advance of equity method losses experienced in the investment in pace carbon resulted in losses reflected in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates totaling million in synfuel related results  inclusive of equity method losses and their related tax benefits as well as the tax credits and other related activity  were earnings of million in of those earnings  which did not continue beyond  million million pre tax was contributed to the vectren foundation in net of that contribution  synfuel related results were million in 
table of contents use of non gaap performance measures contribution to vectren s basic eps per share earnings contributions of the utility group  nonutility group  and corporate and other are presented 
such per share amounts are based on the earnings contribution of each group included in vectren s consolidated results divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
the earnings per share of the groups do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to the groups  but rather represent a direct equity interest in vectren corporation s assets and liabilities as a whole 
these non gaap measures are used by management to evaluate the performance of individual businesses 
accordingly management believes these measures are useful to investors in understanding each business contribution to consolidated earnings per share and in analyzing consolidated period to period changes 
reconciliations of these non gaap measures to their most closely related gaap measure of consolidated earnings per share are included throughout this discussion and analysis 
results excluding the liberty charge this discussion and analysis contains other non gaap financial measures that exclude the charge related to proliance s investment in liberty gas storage  llc liberty charge recorded during management uses consolidated net income  consolidated earnings per share  and nonutility group net income  excluding the liberty charge  to evaluate its results 
management believes analyzing underlying business trends is aided by the removal of the liberty charge due to the significant impact it has on comparability between the periods reported 
the rationale for using such non gaap measures is that the charge in all cases substantially decreases the performance measures  and the period to period changes do not provide meaningful comparative information regarding typical operating results 
a material limitation associated with the use of these measures excluding the liberty charge is that these measures excluding the liberty charge do not include all costs ie the liberty charge recognized in accordance with gaap 
management compensates for this limitation by prominently displaying a reconciliation of these non gaap performance measures to their closest gaap performance measures 
this display also provides financial statement users the option of analyzing results as management does or by analyzing gaap results 
the following table reconciles consolidated net income  consolidated basic eps  and nonutility group net income to those results excluding the liberty charge 
year ended december  in millions  except eps gaap measure exclude liberty charge non gaap measure consolidated net income basic eps nonutility group net income the non gaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap  and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap

critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the consolidated financial statement footnotes describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and nonutility plant  valuing reclamation liabilities  valuing derivative contracts  and estimating uncollectible accounts and coal reserves  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment review of investments the company has both debt and equity investments in unconsolidated entities 
when events occur that may cause one of these investments to be impaired  the company performs both a qualitative and quantitative review of that investment and when necessary performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or in certain cases for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value  to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of equity investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount and an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is other than temporary 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations  among others 

table of contents the recent economic recession impacted the value of commercial real estate investments within the other businesses nonutility portfolio  and the prospect for recovery of that value has diminished 
during  the company assessed its commercial real estate investments for impairment using the methods described above and identified the need to reduce their carrying values 
the impairment charge recorded in totaled million 
significant assumptions impacting these analyses were holding periods  net operating income and capitalization rates  which have increased in the recent economic and credit constrained environment 
related to capitalization rates  the company used a cap rate in its valuation of a suburban chicago commercial real estate holding owned by the company that is currently vacant and a cap rate in its valuation of leased commercial real estate located in charlotte  nc and birmingham  al that serve as collateral for a note receivable 
a basis point increase in those cap rates would have increased the impairment charge by million 
the company examined these investments for impairment throughout  noting that current capitalization rates and other assumptions indicate no further impairment at december  actual realized values  however  could differ from these estimates 
goodwill intangible assets the company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill  most of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements to be the reporting unit 
nonutility group reporting units are generally defined as the operating companies that aggregate that operating segment 
an impairment test requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model and other market based information to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value has been in excess of the carrying amount in each of the last three years and therefore resulted in no impairment 
goodwill related to the nonutility group is also tested using market comparable data  if readily available  or a discounted cash flow model 
estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge 
the company also annually tests non amortizing intangible assets for impairment and amortizing intangible assets are tested on an event and circumstance basis 
during the last three years  these tests yielded no impairment charges 
pension other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other inputs  and obtains actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of percent  an expected return on plan assets of percent  a rate of compensation increase of percent  and an inflation assumption of percent 
these key assumptions were unchanged from the assumptions utilized in to estimate costs  the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and inflation assumption were percent  percent  percent  and percent respectively 
management currently estimates a pension and postretirement cost of approximately million in  compared to approximately million in  million in  and million in future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  asset values or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 

table of contents management estimates that a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to estimate projected costs would generally increase periodic benefit cost by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to estimate periodic cost would have increased costs by approximately million 
unbilled revenues to more closely match revenues and expenses  the company records revenues for all gas and electricity delivered to customers but not billed at the end of the accounting period 
the company uses actual units billed during the month to allocate unbilled units by customer class 
those allocated units are multiplied by rates in effect during the month to calculate unbilled revenue at balance sheet dates 
regulation at each reporting date  the company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates 
this review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in fasb guidance related to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company s operations cease to meet the criteria  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets and liabilities 
in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant 
financial condition within vectren s consolidated group  utility holdings primarily funds the short term and long term financing needs of the utility group operations  and vectren capital corp vectren capital funds short term and long term financing needs of the nonutility group and corporate operations 
vectren corporation guarantees vectren capital s debt  but does not guarantee utility holdings debt 
vectren capital s long term and short term obligations outstanding at december  approximated million and million  respectively 
utility holdings outstanding long term and short term borrowing arrangements are jointly and severally guaranteed by indiana gas  sigeco  and vedo 
utility holdings long term and short term obligations outstanding at december  approximated million and million  respectively 
additionally  prior to utility holdings formation  indiana gas and sigeco funded their operations separately  and therefore  have long term debt outstanding funded solely by their operations 
sigeco will also occasionally issue tax exempt debt to fund qualifying pollution control capital expenditures 
the company s common stock dividends are primarily funded by utility operations 
nonutility operations have demonstrated profitability and the ability to generate cash flows 
these cash flows are primarily reinvested in other nonutility ventures  but are also used to fund a portion of the company s dividends  and from time to time may be reinvested in utility operations or used for corporate expenses 
the credit ratings of the senior unsecured debt of utility holdings and indiana gas  at december   are a baa as rated by standard and poor s ratings services standard and poor s and moody s investors service moody s  respectively 
the credit ratings on sigeco s secured debt are a a utility holdings commercial paper has a credit rating of a p the current outlook of both moody s and standard and poor s is stable

the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
standard and poor s and moody s lowest level investment grade rating is bbb and baa  respectively 
the company s consolidated equity capitalization objective is percent of long term capitalization 
this objective may have varied  and will vary  depending on particular business opportunities  capital spending requirements  execution of long term financing plans  and seasonal factors that affect the company s operations 
the company s equity component was percent and percent of long term capitalization at december  and  respectively 
long term capitalization includes long term debt  including current maturities and debt subject to tender  as well as common shareholders equity 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants 

table of contents available liquidity in current credit conditions the company s a baa investment grade credit ratings have allowed it to access the capital markets as needed during this period of financial market volatility 
over the last twelve to twenty four months  the company has significantly enhanced its short term borrowing capacity with the completion of several long term financing transactions including the issuance of long term debt in both and and the settlement of an equity forward contract in the liquidity provided by these transactions  when coupled with existing cash and expected internally generated funds  is expected to be sufficient over the near term to fund anticipated capital expenditures  investments  debt security redemptions  and other working capital requirements 
debt redemptions total million in in  million is due 
the company is currently considering the level of need for nonutility group long term debt and whether to prefund a portion of the million utility group debt redemption with a long term debt issuance in in addition  investors have the one time option to put million in may of and a one time option to put million in long term debt transactions completed in include a million issuance by vectren capital and a million issuance by vectren utility holdings 
sigeco also recently remarketed million of long term debt  supported by letters of credit issued under vectren utility holdings credit facility and completed a million tax exempt first mortgage bond issuance 
these transactions  along with financing transactions completed in and  are more fully described below 
consolidated short term borrowing arrangements at december   the company had million of short term borrowing capacity  including million for the utility group and million for the wholly owned nonutility group and corporate operations 
as reduced by letters of credit and borrowings currently outstanding  approximately million was available for the utility group operations and approximately million was available for the wholly owned nonutility group and corporate operations 
of the million in utility group capacity  million is available through june  and million is available through november   and the million in nonutility group capacity is available through november  in september of  approximately million of short term credit capacity specific to the nonutility group was no longer needed as a result of the recent long term debt issuance by vectren capital and was not renewed 
in addition  a million credit facility at energy systems group  one of the company s wholly owned nonutility subsidiaries  also expired during this supplemental facility was no longer needed and thus was not renewed 
historically  the company uses short term borrowings to supplement working capital needs and also to fund capital investments and debt redemptions until financed on a long term basis 
the company has historically funded the short term borrowing needs of utility holdings operations through the commercial paper market 
in  the company s access to longer term commercial paper was significantly reduced as a result of the turmoil and volatility in the financial markets 
as a result  the company met short term financing needs through a combination of a p commercial paper issuances and draws on utility holdings million commercial paper back up credit facilities 
throughout  the company has been able to place commercial paper without any significant issues 
however  the level of required short term borrowings is significantly lower compared to historical trends due to the recently completed long term financing transactions 
compared to historical trends  the company anticipates over the next several years a greater use of the long term capital markets to more timely finance capital investments and other growth as well as debt security redemptions 
this change comes as short term borrowing arrangements have become less certain  more volatile  and the cost of unutilized capacity is expected to increase significantly 
thus  while the company expects to renew these facilities in  the company anticipates that borrowing levels will be lower due to the reduced requirements for short term borrowings described above 
under current market conditions  this change is expected to yield greater certainty to financing business operations at the expense of some increase in interest costs 

table of contents proliance short term borrowing arrangements proliance  a nonutility energy marketing affiliate of the company  has separate borrowing capacity available through a syndicated credit facility 
proliance renegotiated a new credit facility with terms to expire june  the terms of this facility allow for million of capacity  as adjusted for letters of credit and current inventory and receivable balances 
this credit facility  when coupled with internally generated funds  is expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet proliance s operational needs 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding 
the current facility is not guaranteed by vectren or citizens 
new share issues the company may periodically issue new common shares to satisfy the dividend reinvestment plan  stock option plan and other employee benefit plan requirements 
new issuances added additional liquidity of million in  million in and million in in  new issuances required to meet these various plan requirements are estimated to be consistent with issuances in potential uses of liquidity pension postretirement funding obligations as of december   asset values of the company s qualified pension plans were approximately percent of the projected benefit obligation 
in order to increase the funded status  management currently estimates the qualified pension plans require company contributions of million in under current market conditions  the company estimates similar funding in during  approximately million in contributions to qualified pension plans were made 
in addition to the qualified plan funding  the company anticipates payments totaling million in associated with its other retirement and deferred compensation plans 
corporate guarantees the company issues corporate guarantees to certain vendors and customers of its wholly owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
these guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations  rather  they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate obligations in order to allow those subsidiaries and affiliates the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral 
at december   corporate issued guarantees support a portion of esg s performance contracting commitments and warranty obligations described below 
in addition  the company has approximately million of other guarantees outstanding supporting other consolidated subsidiary operations  of which million support non regulated retail gas supply operations 
guarantees issued and outstanding on behalf of unconsolidated affiliates approximated million at december  these guarantees relate primarily to arrangements between proliance and various natural gas pipeline operators 
the company has not been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees and has accrued no significant liabilities related to these guarantees 
performance guarantees product warranties in the normal course of business  esg and other wholly owned subsidiaries issue performance bonds or other forms of assurance that commit them to timely install infrastructure  operate facilities  pay vendors or subcontractors  and or support warranty obligations 
based on a history of meeting performance obligations and installed products operating effectively  no significant liability or cost has been recognized during the periods presented 
specific to esg  in its role as a general contractor in the performance contracting industry  at december   there are open surety bonds supporting future performance 
the average face amount of these bonds is million  and the largest obligation has a face amount of million 
these surety bonds are guaranteed by vectren corporation 
the maximum exposure of these obligations is less than these amounts for several factors  including the level of work already completed 
at december   over percent of work was completed on projects with open surety bonds 
a significant portion of these commitments will be fulfilled within one year 
in instances where esg operates facilities  project guarantees extend over a longer period 
in addition to its performance obligations  esg also warrants the functionality of certain installed infrastructure generally for one year and the associated energy savings over a specified number of years 
in certain instances  these warranty obligations are also backed by vectren corporation 

table of contents planned capital expenditures investments planned utility and nonutility capital expenditures and investments  including contractual purchase and investment commitments discussed below  for the five year period are estimated as follows in millions utility group nonutility group total capital expenditures investments contractual obligations the following is a summary of contractual obligations at december  in millions total thereafter long term debt short term debt long term debt interest commitments nonutility commodity purchase commitments operating leases total certain long term debt issues contain put and call provisions that can be exercised on various dates before maturity 
these provisions allow holders the one time option to put debt back to the company at face value or the company to call debt at face value or at a premium 
long term debt subject to tender during the years following in millions is in  in  zero in and thereafter 
the company has other long term liabilities that total approximately million 
this amount is comprised of the following pension obligations million  postretirement obligations million  deferred compensation and share based compensation obligations million  asset retirement obligations million  investment tax credits million  environmental remediation obligations million  and other obligations including unrecognized tax benefits totaling million 
based on the nature of these items their expected settlement dates cannot be estimated 
the company s regulated utilities have both firm and non firm commitments to purchase natural gas  electricity  and coal as well as certain transportation and storage rights 
costs arising from these commitments  while significant  are pass through costs  generally collected dollar for dollar from retail customers through regulator approved cost recovery mechanisms 
because of the pass through nature of these costs  they have not been included in the listing of contractual obligations 
comparison of historical sources uses of liquidity operating cash flow the company s primary source of liquidity to fund working capital requirements has been cash generated from operations  which totaled million in  compared to million in and million in in  operating cash flows increased million compared to due to increased cash generated from consolidated companies 
this is evident from a million year over year increase in net income before the impacts of depreciation  deferred taxes  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other non cash charges 
tax payments in both and were favorably impacted by federal stimulus plans authorizing bonus depreciation and irs approval in to change its tax method for recognizing repair and maintenance activities 
in addition  due principally to lower gas costs  changes in working capital generated million of additional cash flow year over year 
these increases were offset by additional cash uses associated with noncurrent assets and liabilities 
this increased usage is primarily related to a million increase in pension and other retirement plan contributions 

table of contents in  cash flow from operating activities increased million compared to higher levels of deferred taxes due primarily to federal stimulus plans authorizing bonus depreciation on qualifying capital expenditures increased cash flow approximately million 
working capital changes generated cash of million in compared to cash used of million in the increase in cash from working capital results primarily from the permanent reduction of natural gas inventory associated with vedo s exit of the merchant function  offset by growth in recoverable fuel balances 
the remaining increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to the cash collection of previously deferred regulatory assets 
financing cash flow although working capital requirements are generally funded by cash flow from operations  the company uses short term borrowings to supplement working capital needs when accounts receivable balances are at their highest and gas storage is refilled 
additionally  short term borrowings are required for capital projects and investments until they are financed on a long term basis 
during and  net cash flow associated with financing activities is reflective of management s ongoing effort to rely less on short term borrowing arrangements 
the company s and operating cash flow funded over percent of capital expenditures and dividends in those years 
recently completed long term financing transactions have allowed for the repayment of nearly million in short term borrowings over the past two years  including over million repaid in in addition  these long term financing transactions have financed other capital expenditures on a long term basis 
during the first quarter of  the company mitigated its exposure to auction rate debt markets

table of contents vectren common stock issuance in february  the company sold million authorized but previously unissued shares of its common stock to a group of underwriters in an sec registered primary offering at a price of per share 
the transaction generated proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  of approximately million 
the company executed an equity forward sale agreement equity forward in connection with the offering  and therefore  did not receive proceeds at the time of the equity offering 
the equity forward allowed the company to price an offering under market conditions existing at that time  and to better match the receipt of the offering proceeds and the associated share dilution with the implementation of regulatory initiatives 
on june   the company physically settled the equity forward by delivering the million shares  receiving proceeds of approximately million 
the slight difference between the proceeds generated by the public offering and those received by the company were due to adjustments defined in the equity forward agreement including daily increases in the forward sale price based on a floating interest factor equal to the federal funds rate  less a basis point fixed spread  and structured quarterly decreases to the forward sale price that align with expected company dividend payments 
vectren transferred the proceeds to utility holdings  and utility holdings used the proceeds to repay short term debt obligations incurred primarily to fund its capital expenditure program

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company may also execute derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities to be used in operations and optimizing its generation assets 
the company has in place a risk management committee that consists of senior management as well as financial and operational management 
the committee is actively involved in identifying risks as well as reviewing and authorizing risk mitigation strategies 
commodity price risk regulated operations the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas  coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
constructive regulatory orders  such as those authorizing lost margin recovery  other innovative rate designs  and recovery of unaccounted for gas and other gas related expenses  also mitigate the effect volatile gas costs may have on the company s financial condition 
although vectren s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices have other effects on working capital requirements  interest costs  and some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered 
wholesale power marketing the company s wholesale power marketing activities undertake strategies to optimize electric generating capacity beyond that needed for native load 
in recent years  the primary strategy involves the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
as part of these strategies  the company may also from time to time execute energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in future periods 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability and occasionally offsetting forward purchase contracts 
the company accounts for any energy contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
no market sensitive derivative positions were outstanding on december  and 
table of contents for retail sales of electricity  the company receives the majority of its nox and so allowances at zero cost through an allocation process 
based on arrangements with regulators  wholesale operations can purchase allowances from retail operations at current market values  the value of which is distributed back to retail customers through a miso cost recovery tracking mechanism 
wholesale operations are therefore at risk for the cost of allowances  which for the recent past have been volatile 
the company manages this risk by purchasing allowances from retail operations as needed and occasionally from other third parties in advance of usage 
in the past  the company also used derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk  but no such derivative instruments were outstanding at december  or other operations other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices including natural gas and coal 
other commodity related operations include nonutility retail gas marketing and coal mining operations 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
the company purchases and sells commodities  including electricity  natural gas  and coal to meet customer demands and operational needs 
the company executes forward contracts and occasionally option contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions obligating the company to deliver commodities is mitigated using stored inventory  generating capability  and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts obligating the company to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted nonregulated sales of natural gas and coal that may or may not occur 
with the exception of a small portion of contracts that are derivatives and that qualify as hedges of forecasted transactions  these contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 
unconsolidated affiliate proliance  a nonutility energy marketing affiliate  engages in energy hedging activities to manage pricing decisions  minimize the risk of price volatility  and minimize price risk exposure in the energy markets 
proliance s market exposure arises from storage inventory  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts  which are entered into to support its operating activities 
currently  proliance buys and sells physical commodities and utilizes financial instruments to hedge its market exposure 
however  net open positions in terms of price  volume and specified delivery point do occur 
proliance manages open positions with policies which limit its exposure to market risk and require reporting potential financial exposure to its management and its members
