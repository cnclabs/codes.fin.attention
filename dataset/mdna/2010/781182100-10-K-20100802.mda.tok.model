item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ruby tuesday  inc  including its wholly owned subsidiaries rti  the company  we and or our  owns and operates ruby tuesday casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday concept in selected domestic and international markets 
our mission is to be the best in the bar grill sector of the restaurant industry by delivering to our guests a high quality casual dining experience with compelling value 
while we are in the bar grill sector because of our varied menu  it is our goal to operate at a higher end casual dining experience in terms of quality  food  and service 
as of june   we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants located in states and the district of columbia 
we also own or of the equity of each of domestic franchisees  with the balance of the equity in these franchisees being owned by the various operators of the franchise businesses 
as of year end  these franchisees  which we refer to as franchise partnerships  operated restaurants 
we have a contractual right to acquire  at predetermined valuation formulas  the remaining equity of any or all of the franchise partnerships 
our other franchisees operated domestic and international restaurants 
in total  our franchisees operate restaurants in states  guam  and foreign countries 
in addition  we operate two wok hay full service asian restaurants 
the company owned and operated restaurants are concentrated primarily in the northeast  southeast  mid atlantic  and midwest regions of the united states 
we consider these regions to be our core markets 
our fiscal year ends on the first tuesday following may and  as is the case once every five or six years  we have a week year 
fiscal years   and each contained weeks 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor s understanding of the franchise system  including franchise partnerships and traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenue is not included in  and is not  revenue of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income and equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor 
overview and strategies casual dining  the segment of the industry in which we operate  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  convenience  locations  and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer similar types of services and products as we do 
in  our analysis of the bar and grill segment within casual dining indicated that many concepts  including ruby tuesday  were not clearly differentiated 
we believed that as the segment continued to mature  the lack of differentiation would make it increasingly difficult to attract new guests 
consequently  we created brand reimaging initiatives to implement our strategy of clearly differentiating ruby tuesday from our competitors  as discussed under the caption operations included earlier in this annual report 
we implemented our strategy in stages  first focusing on food  then service  and in  we embarked on the most capital intensive aspect of our reimaging program the creation of a fresh new look for our restaurants 
we believe that ruby tuesday  as a result of these initiatives  is well positioned for the future 
while we were in the process of implementing our brand reimaging  consumer spending came under pressure for a variety of reasons  and further weakened in the fourth quarter of calendar as the economic environment deteriorated  operating results for other casual dining concepts  as well as our operating results  declined significantly 
in response  beginning in the second half of fiscal  we implemented several initiatives intended to enhance our sales  reduce costs and improve cash flow  including the following sales initiatives 
our ruby tuesday concept sales initiatives aim to increase guest traffic by focusing primarily on two areas  menu and marketing 
we have evolved our existing menu items to support our high quality casual dining position  broaden our appeal with product extensions offering more variety and cravability  and provide our guests with compelling value 
our newest menu introduced late in the second quarter of fiscal includes an expanded appetizer line and new dinner entrees  which feature a variety of lobster combinations 
additionally  our new four course brunch and our tuesday steak and lobster programs have driven incremental sales and traffic  in addition to enhancing the perception of the ruby tuesday brand 
through independently conducted studies  we regularly measure our guests perception of our menu offerings and make item modifications to enhance their value proposition  if necessary 
we shifted our marketing strategy to more effectively communicate our brand and value message 
our marketing strategy for the last year and a half has focused on the key pillars of print promotions  digital media  and local marketing programs to entice guests to see the new ruby tuesday  increase frequency of visits  and enhance visibility of the brand 
we have the ability to customize our marketing to specific markets  down to the individual restaurant level  which enables us to respond quickly with a different program if a market or restaurant is not achieving expected results 
we continue to analyze our business by specific periods in order to identify programs to increase sales during off peak times 
as part of our goal of getting more out of existing restaurants by generating higher average restaurant volumes and thus more profit and cash flow with minimal capital investment  we will be converting certain underperforming ruby tuesday concept restaurants into other high quality casual dining brands which might be better suited for success in selected markets 
to that end  on february   we entered into a licensing agreement with jim n nicks barbq riverchase  inc jim n nick s which allows us to operate multiple restaurants under the jim n nick s bar b q name 
jim n nick s is an alabama based barbeque concept that currently operates restaurants in seven states 
on july   we entered into a licensing agreement with gourmet market  inc which allows us to operate multiple restaurants under the truffles name 
truffles is an upscale casual dining caf featuring seafood and steaks which currently operates three restaurants in the vicinity of hilton head island  south carolina 
we are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing ruby tuesday concept restaurants to the jim n nick s  truffles  and wok hay concept restaurants 
we currently anticipate converting one to three company owned ruby tuesday restaurants to each of these three concepts in fiscal cost savings 
in the second half of fiscal  we implemented initiatives focused on driving substantial cost savings at no dilution to the overall guest experience 
these cost savings were the result of labor initiatives  including new scheduling systems and the realignment of field supervisors  which together accounted for approximately half of the savings 
disciplined food cost management  improved operating efficiencies  and the closing of certain underperforming restaurants accounted for the remainder 
these initiatives resulted in cost savings of approximately million in the second half of fiscal alone 
furthermore  our low level of management and labor turnover during fiscal and benefitted us two fold first  a more experienced work force resulted in improved customer service  and second  training costs were greatly reduced 
restaurant closings 
during our second quarter of fiscal we conducted an analysis of all our company operated restaurants based on profitability  brand image  location  and other factors and identified restaurants to close  of which we closed in the third quarter of fiscal and since 
the remaining restaurants will be closed over the next several years as their leases expire  or possibly converted to other high quality casual dining concepts as part of our conversion strategy outlined above 
generate free cash flow and improve our balance sheet 
because of our high leverage  we have been focused on maximizing our cash flow and paying down our debt 
if we are successful in continuing to stabilize same restaurant sales and maintaining or lowering our cost structure  we have the opportunity to generate substantial levels of free cash flow 
furthermore  our near term capital requirements are relatively modest as we anticipate only opening one or two new ruby tuesday restaurants in fiscal  and our maintenance capital spending needs are low because we have remodeled virtually all the company owned restaurants within the last two fiscal years 
we define free cash flow to be the net amount remaining when purchases of property and equipment are subtracted from net cash provided by operating activities 
we generated million of free cash flow in fiscal  all of which was dedicated to the reduction of debt 
we estimate we will generate to million of free cash flow in fiscal included in these estimates is anticipated total capital spending of to million 
our current intentions are to use a substantial portion of the free cash flow generated in fiscal to reduce debt 
our objective is to reduce debt as quickly as possible in order to further reduce the financial risk related to our leverage and to resume returning capital to our shareholders 
for example  we have reduced our debt by million  or  in the last months and by million  or  in the last months 
as a means of strengthening our balance sheet  on july   we raised million in net proceeds through an underwritten public offering of million shares of ruby tuesday  inc common stock 
see further discussion in the financing activities section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
our success in the four key initiatives outlined above has helped us to stabilize sales  drive incremental operating efficiencies  strengthen our balance sheet  and put us in a position where we have more financial and operating flexibility than over the last couple of years 
our longer term strategies are to improve our return on assets and create additional shareholder value 
our same restaurant sales for company owned restaurants declined in fiscal and our diluted earnings per share increased to in fiscal from a diluted loss per share of in fiscal  largely as a result of prior year charges related to restaurant closures and impairments and goodwill impairment  the majority of which were non cash charges 
throughout this md a  we discuss our fiscal financial results in detail  provide insight for fiscal years and  as well as discuss known events  uncertainties  and trends 
we hope our commentary provides insight as to the factors which impacted our performance 
we remind you  that  in order to best obtain an understanding of our financial performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in part ii  item of this form k 
results of operations ruby tuesday restaurants the table below presents the number of ruby tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal through fiscal fiscal year company owned domestic franchise international franchise total during fiscal no company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were opened  company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were closed  six two domestic and four international franchise restaurants were opened and domestic and two international were closed  we sold million shares of ruby tuesday  inc common stock in an underwritten public offering  receiving approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of the shares  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses

restaurant sales restaurant sales in fiscal decreased from fiscal for company owned restaurants and for domestic and international franchised restaurants as explained below 
the tables presented below reflect restaurant sales for the last five years  and other revenue information for the last three years 
restaurant sales in millions fiscal year company owned franchise a a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
other revenue information company restaurant sales in thousands company restaurant sales growth percentage franchise revenue in thousands a franchise revenue growth percentage total revenue in thousands total revenue growth percentage company same restaurant sales growth percentage company average restaurant volumes million million million company average restaurant volumes growth percentage a franchise revenue includes royalty  license  and development fees paid to us by our franchisees  exclusive of support service fees of million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively  which are recorded as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
our company restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended june  decreased to  million compared to the prior year 
this decrease primarily resulted from the closing of restaurants in fiscal and a decrease in same restaurant sales 
the restaurants closed in fiscal produced million of restaurant sales in the prior year 
the decrease in same restaurant sales is attributable to declines in average net check during the first two quarters of fiscal due to our value positioning and print incentive strategy to motivate new guests to visit our restaurants to experience the reimaged ruby tuesday brand 
our decrease in company restaurant sales and operating revenue in fiscal is primarily attributable to the closing of ruby tuesday restaurants during fiscal  of which closed during fiscal s third quarter  and a decrease in same restaurant sales that contributed to lower overall average restaurant volumes 
the restaurants closed in fiscal produced revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in same restaurant sales is partially attributable to reductions in customer counts in the first three quarters of fiscal due to a challenging economic environment and various consumer pressures 
we also believe that other factors contributing to the decline in same restaurant sales for both fiscal and include the loss of some of our customers who did not feel as comfortable in our re imaged restaurants  the impact of heavy price focused advertising by some of our traditional competitors  and leveling of sales growth in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry resulting from the growth of supply outpacing that of demand 
franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties up to of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue decreased to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties  which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decreases in fiscal and are due to franchise store closures  temporarily reduced royalty rates for certain franchisees  and a decrease in same restaurant sales for domestic franchise ruby tuesday restaurants of and for fiscal and  respectively 
under our accounting policy  we do not recognize franchise fee revenue for any franchise with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has either borrowed directly from us or through a facility for which we provide a guarantee 
we also do not recognize additional franchise fee revenue from franchisees with fees in excess of days past due 
accordingly  we have deferred recognition of a portion of franchise revenue from certain franchises 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and million as of june  and june   respectively  which are included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
the increase in unearned income is primarily due to an increase in unearned fees due from a traditional franchisee million  for whom we agreed to defer fees for a limited period of time while the franchise negotiated with its lenders for extended terms 
total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
franchise restaurant sales in thousands a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
the decrease in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in average restaurant volumes as a result of a decrease in domestic same restaurant sales 
the decrease in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in average restaurant volumes as a result of a decrease in domestic same restaurant sales 
operating profits the following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  for the periods indicated 
all information is derived from our consolidated financial statements located in part ii  item of this form k 
restaurant sales and operating revenue franchise revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue selling  general  and administrative  net of support service fees closures and impairments goodwill impairment equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises interest expense  net total operating costs and expenses income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss pre tax income loss for fiscal  pre tax income was million or of total revenue  as compared to a pre tax loss of million or of total revenue  for fiscal the increase in pre tax income from the prior year is due in significant part to reductions in impairment charges as we announced a plan in the prior year to restructure our property portfolio which resulted in closures and impairments expense of million during the prior year 
during fiscal we also impaired our goodwill million 
the increase also included the elimination of million in pre tax losses recorded in fiscal on the restaurants closed during fiscal  as well as decreases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  depreciation and amortization  selling  general  and administrative  net  and interest expense  net 
these lower costs were partially offset by a decline of in same restaurant sales at company owned restaurants  lower franchise revenue  higher losses from unconsolidated equity method franchises  and increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  of cost of merchandise 
for fiscal  pre tax loss was million or of total revenue  as compared to pre tax income of million or of total revenue  for fiscal the decrease in pre tax income is due in significant part to impairment charges as we restructured our property portfolio which resulted in fiscal closures and impairments expense of million in connection with restaurant closings during we also recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million to write off our goodwill 
the decrease is also attributable to decreases in same restaurant sales  coupled with increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  closures and impairment expenses  and interest expense  net 
offsetting these increased expenses was a lower depreciation charge due  in part  to the acceleration of depreciation for the reimaged restaurants in fiscal in the paragraphs that follow  we discuss in more detail the components of the changes in pre tax income loss for years ended june  and june   respectively  as compared to the comparable prior year 
because a significant portion of the costs recorded in the cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  and depreciation and amortization categories are either variable or highly correlate with the number of restaurants we operate  we evaluate our trends by comparing the costs as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  as well as the absolute dollar change  to the comparable prior year 
restaurant closings the table below shows operating results for the years ended june  and june  for the restaurants that closed in fiscal in thousands total revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization selling  general  and administrative net loss cost of merchandise cost of merchandise decreased million from the prior year to million for the year ended june  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  cost of merchandise increased from to 
excluding the million decrease from the elimination of restaurants closed in fiscal  cost of merchandise increased million 
the million increase for the year ended june  referred to above is a result of a shift in menu mix corresponding to our value promotions which are driving our guests to order higher cost menu items  coupled with the introduction of higher food cost items such as lobster entrees on our new menus 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the increase is due to several promotions offered during fiscal including freestanding insert coupons in all markets with company owned restaurants  direct address label mail pieces  and a value promotion for our so connected guests offering a buy one get one free or a buy one get one free up to on our specialties  fork tender ribs  and handcrafted steaks 
cost of merchandise decreased million from fiscal to million for fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  cost of merchandise increased in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding the million decrease from the elimination of restaurants closed in fiscal  cost of merchandise decreased million 
the million remaining decrease for the year ended june  referred to above is primarily a result of a decrease in guest counts from the prior year  offset by increases resulting from fiscal menu initiatives 
the menu initiatives included enhancements such as the introduction of lobster and steak menu items and increasing the triple prime burger to eight ounces while offering endless fries with all burgers 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the increase is due primarily to value initiatives related to our menu  as discussed above  and our marketing 
our marketing initiatives included several promotions offered in fiscal including freestanding insert and internet coupons offering a buy one get one free on various menu items 
the marketing initiatives had the impact in the current year of reducing average net check which increased the related food cost as a percentage of restaurants sales and operating revenue 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs decreased million from the prior year to million for the year ended june  this amount includes million of payroll and related costs spent in fiscal at the restaurants closed in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs decreased from to 
for the year ended june   the remaining decrease of million not attributable to closings is primarily due to decreases in hourly labor as a result of new staffing guidelines for certain positions in our restaurants and the elimination of the dedicated to go positions in our mall restaurants and certain other locations  both of which were partially offset by increases in minimum wage rates and payroll taxes in certain states since the prior year 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the decrease in payroll and related costs in fiscal is attributable to the impact of closing restaurants in fiscal  which ran higher than system average labor  and the hourly labor cost savings initiatives discussed in the prior paragraph 
payroll and related costs decreased million from fiscal to million for the year ended june  this reduction includes lowered payroll and related costs million in fiscal as compared to fiscal at the restaurants closed in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs increased from to 
the remaining million decrease not attributable to closings is primarily due to decreases in hourly labor as a result of new staffing guidelines for certain positions in our restaurants  reductions in dedicated to go positions at certain locations  lower hourly turnover  and the elimination of certain positions from fiscal to as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the increase in payroll and related costs in fiscal is primarily due to minimum wage increases in several states during the current year and higher management labor due to loss of operating leverage on lower sales volumes 
these increased costs were partially offset by cost savings initiatives implemented in the second half of fiscal including new labor scheduling systems 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs decreased million to million for the year ended june   as compared to the prior year 
this decrease includes million of costs incurred on the restaurants closed in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  these costs decreased from to 
for the year ended june   the remaining reductions not attributable to fiscal closings related to the following in thousands utilities bad debt expense rent and leasing supplies visa mastercard antitrust settlement other repairs insurance net reductions in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue for year ended june   the decrease is primarily due to decreases in utilities resulting from reductions in overall electric usage and changing natural gas and fuel vendors at certain of our restaurants which resulted in more favorable rates  lower bad debt expense due to larger prior year adjustments for notes due from certain franchisees  reductions in rent and leasing due to the closure of leased restaurants during fiscal  lower credit card expense resulting from income relating to the net proceeds from the visa mastercard antitrust class action litigation in which we were a class member  and other decreases 
these were partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance due to upgrades and repairs at certain of our restaurants and higher general liability insurance expense due to unfavorable claims experience 
other restaurant operating costs decreased million to million for the year ended june   as compared to fiscal this decrease includes million of fewer costs incurred in fiscal as opposed to fiscal on the restaurants closed in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  these costs increased in fiscal for the year ended june   the remaining reductions not attributable to closings related to the following in thousands repairs supplies other utilities bad debt expense for the year ended june   in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the remaining million in reductions not attributable to closings related to reductions in repairs expense as a result of lower repairs and maintenance costs due to the completion of a re imaging of our restaurants in fiscal and reduced supplies expense due to cost savings from using certain reusable kitchen products in fiscal compared to disposable products in fiscal and higher expense in fiscal as a result of glassware and tablecloth upgrades 
these were partially offset by higher utilities  primarily increases in overall electricity usage  and higher bad debt expense due to larger adjustments for notes due from certain franchisees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million for fiscal  compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  this expense decreased from to 
in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the decrease for fiscal is primarily due to reduced depreciation for assets that became fully depreciated since the prior year reductions of million 
additionally  contributing to the reduction was the impact of the restaurant closures which incurred depreciation expenses totaling million in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million for fiscal  compared to fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  this expense decreased from to 
in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the decrease was due primarily to accelerated depreciation in fiscal million for restaurants re imaged as part of our re imaging initiative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses  net of support service fee income  decreased million to million in fiscal  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease includes million of costs incurred in fiscal on the closed restaurants 
the decrease in absolute dollars from fiscal to is partially attributable to a reduction in advertising million as a result of no national cable television advertising during fiscal  reflecting a shift in our marketing strategy to one based more on offering guests incentives through print media rather than through television 
additionally  management labor was lower million due to the elimination and reduction of certain positions 
these were partially offset by higher bonus expense million and higher share based employee compensation million due to improved achievement of performance goals 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  net of support service fee income  decreased million to million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this decrease includes million of lowered costs incurred in fiscal on the restaurants closed in fiscal as compared with fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars from fiscal to is partially attributable to a reduction in advertising expense million as a result of decreases in cable television advertising due to less air time  advertising agency fees  and new menu printing expense 
this reduction was facilitated by our shift in marketing strategy to include more coupons  the effect of which is to lower the average net check and increase food costs 
additionally  management labor was lower million due to the elimination and reduction of certain positions 
share based employee compensation decreased million  due to smaller grants in fiscal following a shift in compensation strategy in which management s annual award  formerly issued each april  was transitioned to july to better coincide with the fiscal year to which it relates 
also contributing to the million decrease in share based compensation for fiscal was the expensing in fiscal of million for stock options and restricted shares awarded to a retirement eligible executive 
closures and impairments closures and impairments expense decreased million to million for the year ended june   as compared to fiscal the decrease is due primarily to reductions in impairment charges million  closed restaurant lease reserve expense million  dead site costs million  other closing costs million  and higher gains on the sale of surplus properties million 
closures and impairments increased million to million for the year ended june  as compared to fiscal the increase is due primarily to impairment charges for restaurants million  impairments for discounting surplus properties and the company airplane in order to better market them for sale million  closed restaurant lease reserve expense million  dead site costs million  other closing costs million  and other impairments million  which were partially offset by higher gains during the period on the sale of surplus properties million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our closures and impairment charges recorded during fiscal   and goodwill impairment we concluded during the second quarter of fiscal that our goodwill was fully impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge during fiscal of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our goodwill impairment 
equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises for fiscal  our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchises was million compared to negligible equity in earnings for fiscal the change is attributable to increased losses from investments in three of our six owned franchise partnerships over the prior year 
contributing to our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchises were lower same restaurant sales  which was partially offset by an increase in earnings from investments in the other three owned franchise partnerships over the prior year and by lower advertising charges during the current year 
as of june   we held equity investments in each of six franchise partnerships which collectively operate ruby tuesday restaurants 
for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchisees was negligible as compared to equity in losses of million in fiscal the change primarily resulted from decreased losses from investments in each of our six owned franchise partnerships  including three franchise partnerships that experienced losses in the prior year 
the decrease in losses primarily resulted from reduced fees charged to certain of the owned franchise partnerships during fiscal as compared to the prior year  along with rebates from rti for million of fees  which had the impact of increasing equity in earnings by million 
the reduced fees  while contributing to improved equity in earnings  had the contrasting impact of lowering our franchise revenue 
as of june   we held equity investments in each of six franchise partnerships which collectively operate ruby tuesday restaurants 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended june   primarily due to lower average debt outstanding on the revolving credit agreement the credit facility  the retirement of the series a senior notes  lower interest rates on the credit facility  and other debt payments made since the prior year 
net interest expense increased million in fiscal due to higher rates on certain of our debt which was restructured in the latter part of fiscal  offset by lower average debt balances for the fiscal year due to applying our free cash flow to the pay down of debt 
provision benefit for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for the prior year 
the change in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the fact that the company reported an operating loss in fiscal and income in fiscal fica tip credits and work opportunity tax credits generated in fiscal increased the effective tax rate above the statutory rate 
the two tax credits are driven primarily by restaurant sales  rather than closures and impairments and goodwill impairment  which together contributed significantly to the fiscal operating loss 
a similar amount of tax credits generated in fiscal decreased the effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily a result of the company recording a net loss from operations in fiscal as discussed above coupled with an increase in tax credits compared to the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  in part reflecting an overall slowdown in consumer spending  our sales and operating cash flow declined and we renegotiated certain of our loan agreements 
as discussed in more detail below  these revised loan agreements place restrictions on the use of our free cash flow  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  and require us to reduce our outstanding indebtedness with our excess free cash flow 
following these changes  we adopted a strategy to improve our balance sheet  and during fiscal and our cash from operations was principally used to reduce debt 
sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used provided by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net decrease in cash and short term investments operating activities our cash provided by operations is generally derived from cash receipts generated by our restaurant customers and franchisees 
substantially all of the  million   million  and  million of restaurant sales and operating revenue disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal   and  respectively  was received in cash either at the point of sale or within two to four days when our guests paid with debit or credit cards 
our primary uses of cash for operating activities are food and beverage purchases  payroll and benefit costs  restaurant operating costs  general and administrative expenses  and marketing  a significant portion of which are incurred and paid in the same period 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal increased million from the prior year to million 
the increase is due to an increase in net income  after non cash adjustments 
the increase in net income of million for fiscal as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the after tax impact of a substantial decline in non cash impairment charges and lower depreciation in fiscal compared with that of the prior year 
excluding these items  as well as the other non cash items which impact net income  the increase in net income was million 
these and other factors leading to our net income increase are discussed in the results of operations section of our md a 
net cash collected for income taxes was million in fiscal as opposed to million in fiscal due primarily to a tax accounting method change  as permitted by the internal revenue service  relating to the expensing of certain repairs and a collection of the carryback of the federal net operating losses generated in fiscal included in the million increase in net income mentioned above are changes in deferred income taxes relating to this tax accounting method change 
offsetting these increases were various uses of cash including additional outlays for inventory million  due in part to the advance purchase of lobster as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and increased payments associated with closed store leases million due to additional payments for lease settlements in fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was comparable to that of fiscal as many of the charges which contributed to our net loss  such as higher asset impairment expense associated with the closing of restaurants and discounting surplus properties  the goodwill impairment  and an increase in bad debt expense were non cash 
excluding these items  as well as the other non cash items which impacted our net loss  the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was million 
these and other factors leading to our net loss for fiscal are discussed in the results of operations section of our md a 
offsetting the decrease in cash flow attributable to lower cash based net income was an increase in income taxes collected of million 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of june  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset or debt reduction a long term liability and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
investing activities we require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants  limited new restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  remodeling of existing restaurants  and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts 
property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with internally generated cash flows for fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  proceeds from the disposal of assets produced million and million of cash in fiscal and  respectively  following an action taken to aggressively market surplus properties in order to pay down debt 
amounts reflected for fiscal included million for a company wide re image project 
also during fiscal  we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire  directly and through our subsidiaries  the remaining member or limited partnership interests of three franchise partnerships and certain assets from wok hay  llc 
these acquisitions added restaurants to the company 
further acquisitions  particularly from franchise partnerships in the eastern united states  are expected to occur during fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be to million based on our planned improvements for existing restaurants and our expectation that we will open approximately one to two company owned ruby tuesday restaurants and convert approximately one to three ruby tuesday concept restaurants to each of the jim n nick s  truffles  and wok hay concepts in fiscal we intend to fund capital expenditures for company owned restaurants with cash provided by operations 
financing activities historically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises and refranchising transactions 
when these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs  we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness or  more recently  through the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
our current borrowings and credit facilities and our recent common stock offering are described below 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on july   we closed an underwritten public offering of million shares of ruby tuesday  inc common stock at per share  less underwriting discounts 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of the shares  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
the net proceeds were used to repay indebtedness under our five year credit facility 
on november   we entered into the credit facility to provide capital for general corporate purposes 
on february   we amended and restated our credit facility to increase the aggregate amount we may borrow to million 
this amount included a million subcommitment for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a million subcommitment for swingline loans 
due to concerns that at some point in the future we might not be in compliance with certain of our debt covenants  we entered into an additional amendment of the amended and restated credit facility on may  the may  amendment to the credit facility  as well as a similarly dated amendment and restatement of the notes issued in the private placement as discussed below  eased financial covenants regarding the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum funded debt ratio 
we are currently in compliance with our debt covenants 
in exchange for the new covenant requirements  in addition to higher interest rate spreads and mandatory reductions in capacity and or prepayments of principal  the amendments also imposed restrictions on future capital expenditures and required us to achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters before we may pay dividends or repurchase any of our stock 
as of june   we have achieved the required leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters  and thus are now allowed  if our board of directors so chooses  to reinstate dividend payments and repurchases of our stock 
following the may  amendment to the credit facility  through a series of scheduled quarterly and other required reductions  our original million capacity has been reduced  as of june   to million 
we expect the capacity of the credit facility to be further reduced by million in fiscal under the credit facility  interest rates charged on borrowings can vary depending on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or an adjusted libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin is zero to for the base rate loans and a percentage ranging from to for the libo rate based option 
we pay commitment fees quarterly ranging from to on the unused portion of the credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we had borrowings of million with an associated floating rate of interest of at june  as of june   we had million outstanding with an associated floating rate of interest of 
after consideration of letters of credit outstanding  we had million available under the credit facility as of june  the credit facility will mature on february  on april   we issued notes totaling million through a private placement of debt the private placement 
on may   concurrent with the credit facility discussed above  we amended and restated the notes issued in the private placement 
the may  amendment requires us to offer quarterly and other prepayments  which predominantly consist of semi annual prepayments to be determined based upon excess cash flows as defined in the private placement 
on april   we paid off the remaining balance of million of private placement series a notes using funds borrowed under the credit facility 
at june   the private placement consisted of million in notes with an interest rate of the series b notes 
the series b notes mature on april  during fiscal  we offered  and our noteholders accepted  principal prepayments of million on the series b notes 
we estimate that we will offer prepayments totaling million during the next twelve months 
accordingly  we have classified million as current as of june  this amount includes four quarterly offers of million each and additional amounts to be determined based upon excess cash flows 
simultaneous with the other may  amendments  we entered into a pledge agreement with our credit facility and private placement creditors  as well as those creditors associated with our franchise facility discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  whereby we pledged certain subsidiary equity interests as security for the repayment of our obligations under these agreements 
there were no share repurchases or dividends paid during fiscal or for fiscal  cash used for share repurchases totaled million 
cash used for dividend payments during fiscal totaled million 
covenant compliance under the terms of the credit facility and the notes issued in the private placement  we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests and covenants 
the financial ratios include maximum funded debt  minimum fixed charge coverage  and minimum net worth covenants 
our continued ability to meet those financial ratios  tests  and covenants can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios  tests  and covenants 
maximum funded debt covenant our maximum funded debt covenant is an adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitdar ratio 
adjusted total debt  as defined in our covenants  includes items both on balance sheet debt and capital lease obligations and off balance sheet such as the present value of leases  letters of credit  and guarantees 
consolidated ebitdar is consolidated net income loss for the company and its majority owned subsidiaries plus interest charges  income tax  depreciation  amortization  rent  and other non cash charges 
among other charges  we have reflected share based compensation  asset impairment  and bad debt expense  as non cash 
consolidated ebitdar and adjusted total debt are not presentations made in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and  as such  should not be considered a measure of financial performance or condition  liquidity  or profitability 
they also should not be considered alternatives to gaap based net income or balance sheet amounts or operating cash flows or indicators of the amount of free cash flow available for discretionary use by management  as consolidated ebitdar does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments  or debt service requirements and adjusted total debt includes certain off balance sheet items 
further  because not all companies use identical calculations  amounts reflected by rti as consolidated ebitdar or adjusted total debt may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we believe the information shown below is relevant as it presents the amounts used to calculate covenants which are provided to our lenders 
non compliance with our debt covenants could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under such agreements 
the following is a reconciliation of our total long term debt and capital leases  which are gaap based  to adjusted total debt as defined in our bank covenants in thousands june  current portion of long term debt  including capital leases long term debt and capital leases  less current maturities total long term debt and capital leases present value of operating leases letters of credit guarantees adjusted total debt non gaap measure 
see below for discussion regarding reconciliation to gaap based amounts 
the following is a reconciliation of net income  which is a gaap based measure of our operating results  to consolidated ebitdar as defined in our bank covenants in thousands twelve months ended june  net income interest expense income taxes depreciation amortization of intangibles rent expense share based compensation expense asset impairments equity in losses of subsidiaries bad debt expense amortization of debt issuance costs non cash accruals other consolidated ebitdar adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitdar actual x maximum allowed per covenant x the credit facility and notes issued in the private placement require us to maintain a maximum funded debt ratio  defined as adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitdar  of less than or equal to x from march  to march   x from march  to march   and  for the notes issued in the private placement only  x thereafter 
we expect to generate free cash flow of to million during fiscal  a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to the reduction of debt 
minimum fixed charge coverage our fixed charge coverage ratio compares consolidated ebitdar as discussed above to interest and cash based rents 
the following shows our computation of our fixed charge coverage ratio in thousands twelve months ended june  consolidated ebitdar interest expense cash rents total non gaap measure 
see below for discussion regarding reconciliation to gaap based amounts 
fixed charge covenant actual x minimum allowed per covenant x the credit facility and notes issued in the private placement require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to x through march   x from march  to march   and  for the notes issued in conjunction with the private placement  x thereafter 
minimum consolidated net worth covenant our minimum consolidated net worth covenant requires us to maintain a net worth  primarily comprised of the par value of our common stock  plus additional paid in capital and retained earnings  of at least  plus of our consolidated net income for each completed fiscal year ending after june  for purposes of this requirement  we are allowed to exclude from retained earnings charges recorded for the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million relating to impairments of other intangible assets 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million and million relating to impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
we reported net income of million for the period of fiscal and fiscal  and a net loss for fiscal under our covenants  this level of net income results in a consolidated net worth requirement  as defined  of million 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment million  net of tax and other intangible asset impairments million  net of tax  the sum of the par value of our common stock  additional paid in capital  and retained earnings as of june  was million 
non gaap amounts used in debt covenant calculations as previously discussed  we use various non gaap amounts in our adjusted total debt  consolidated ebitdar  and fixed charge covenant calculations 
two of the amounts presented in the adjusted total debt calculation  the present value of operating leases and letters of credit  are off balance sheet and there is no corresponding amount presented in our consolidated balance sheets 
we do have a million liability for guarantees recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
the amount on the balance sheet is the fair value of our guarantee  which is million lower than the amount presented in our debt covenant calculations million  the full amount of the guarantee 
our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio allows for recurring cash rents to be included in the denominator 
cash rents million on a rolling month basis differ from rents determined in accordance with gaap million by the following amounts in thousands cash rents change in rent accruals change in closed restaurant lease reserve rent  rent settlement payments on closed restaurants gaap based rent expense share repurchases from time to time our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock as a means to return excess capital to our shareholders 
the timing  price  quantity  and manner of the purchases have been made at the discretion of management  depending upon market conditions and the restrictions contained in our loan agreements 
although million shares remained available for purchase under existing programs at june   our loan agreements  as amended in fiscal  prohibit the repurchase of our common stock until we achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
these thresholds were not achieved until the end of fiscal and thus we did not repurchase any shares of rti common stock during fiscal the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future 
significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term financial obligations were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years notes payable and other long term debt  including current maturities a revolving credit facility a senior notes series b a interest b operating leases c purchase obligations d pension obligations e total f a see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our debt 
b amounts represent contractual interest payments on our fixed rate debt instruments 
interest payments on our variable rate revolving credit facility and variable rate notes payable with balances of million and million  respectively  as of june  have been excluded from the amounts shown above  primarily because the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility  described further in note of the consolidated financial statements  fluctuates daily 
additionally  the amounts shown above include interest payments on the series b notes at the current interest rate of 
this rate could be different in the future based upon certain leverage ratios 
c this amount includes operating leases totaling million for which sublease income from franchisees or others is expected 
certain of these leases obligate us to pay maintenance costs  utilities  real estate taxes  and insurance  which are excluded from the amounts shown above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
d the amounts for purchase obligations include cash commitments under contract for food items and supplies  utility contracts  and other miscellaneous commitments 
e see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
f this amount excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations 
commercial commitments were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years letters of credit a franchise loan guarantees a divestiture guarantees total a includes a million letter of credit which secures franchisees borrowings for construction of restaurants being financed under a franchise loan facility 
the franchise loan guarantees totaling million also shown in the table exclude the guarantee of million for construction to date on the restaurants being financed under the facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
off balance sheet arrangements see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating leases and franchise partnership and divestiture guarantees 
critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to approval of the award by our board of directors 
we determine the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least one quarter shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
at june   we had restaurants that had been open more than one year with rolling month negative cash flows  of which have been impaired to salvage value 
of the which remained  we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at each of the restaurants and determined no impairment was necessary 
the remaining net book value of these restaurants was million at june  should sales at these restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
franchise accounting equity method accounting as of june   we were the franchisor of franchise partnership ruby tuesday restaurants and traditional domestic and international franchised restaurants 
based on an analysis prepared using financial information obtained  when necessary  from the franchise entities  we concluded that  for all periods presented  we were not required to consolidate any of the franchise entities under us generally accepted accounting principles 
although we do have loans to and provide guarantees for certain of our franchise partnerships  they each have substantial other business activities 
we have not consolidated these entities  as we believe that each of these entities meets the definition of a business and we do not provide more than half of the total of the equity  subordinated debt  and other forms of subordinated financial support to these entities based on an analysis of the fair values of our interests in these entities 
we apply the equity method of accounting to our six owned franchise partnerships 
accordingly  we recognize our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of the franchise partnerships in the consolidated statements of operations when reported by those franchisees 
the cost method of accounting is applied to all owned franchise partnerships 
revenue recognition we charge our franchise partnerships various monthly fees that are calculated as a percentage of the respective franchise s monthly sales 
our franchise agreements allow us to charge up to a royalty fee  a support service fee  a marketing and purchasing fee  and an advertising fee of up to 
we defer recognition of franchise fee revenue for any franchise partnership with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has either borrowed directly from us or through a facility for which we provide a guarantee 
we also do not recognize franchise fee revenue from franchises with fees in excess of days past due 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and million as of june  and june   respectively  which are included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful notes and interest income we follow a systematic methodology each quarter in our analysis of franchise and other notes receivable in order to estimate losses inherent at the balance sheet date 
a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio involves reviewing the following for each significant borrower terms including interest rate  original note date  payoff date  and principal and interest start dates  note amounts including the original balance  current balance  associated debt guarantees  and total exposure  and other relevant information including whether the borrower is making timely interest  principal  royalty  and support payments  the borrower s debt coverage ratios  the borrower s current financial condition and sales trends  the borrower s additional borrowing capacity  and  as appropriate  management s judgment on the quality of the borrower s operations 
based on the results of this analysis  the allowance for doubtful notes is adjusted as appropriate 
no portion of the allowance for doubtful notes is allocated to guarantees 
in the event that collection is deemed to be an issue  a number of actions to resolve the issue are possible  including modification to the terms of payment of franchise fees or note obligations or a restructuring of the borrower s debt to better position the borrower to fulfill its obligations 
the allowance for doubtful notes represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the notes receivable at the balance sheet date 
during fiscal   and  we increased the reserve million  million  and million  respectively  based on our estimate of the extent of those losses 
we recognize interest income on notes receivable when earned which sometimes precedes collection 
a number of our franchise notes have  since the inception of these notes  allowed for the deferral of interest during the first one to three years 
all franchisees that issued outstanding notes to us are currently paying interest on these notes 
it is our policy to cease accruing interest income and recognize interest on a cash basis when we determine the collection of interest is doubtful 
the same analysis noted above for doubtful notes is utilized in determining whether to cease recognizing interest income and thereafter record interest payments on the cash basis 
lease obligations we lease a significant number of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments  called contingent rents  when the associated restaurants sales volumes exceed agreed upon levels 
we recognize contingent rental expense in annual as well as interim periods prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense  provided that achievement of that target is considered probable 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
as of june   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future tax deductions attributable to our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures should a taxing authority take a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the updated guidance eliminates the prior exceptions to consolidating qualifying special purpose entities  contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary  and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this guidance also contains a new requirement that any term  transaction  or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity s status as a variable interest entity  a company s power over a variable interest entity  or a company s obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying the provisions of the pre codification guidance 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  fiscal for rti 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fair value guidance requiring new disclosures and clarification of existing disclosures for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on either a recurring or non recurring basis 
the guidance requires disclosure of transfer activity into and out of level and level fair value measurements and also requires more detailed disclosure about the activity within level fair value measurements 
the majority of the requirements in this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  our fiscal fourth quarter 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
requirements related to level disclosures are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  our fiscal fourth quarter 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statement disclosures 
known events  uncertainties  and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  letters of credit  and any guarantees  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility 
this strategy has periodically allowed us to repurchase rti common stock 
during the year ended june   we repurchased no shares of rti common stock 
the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased  as of june   is approximately million 
to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises  future repurchases  if any  may be funded by borrowings 
however  as previously discussed  under the terms of the amendment to the credit facility and the amendment and restatement of the private placement  we could not engage in the repurchase of our stock until we achieved certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of june   we have achieved the required thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters  and thus are now allowed  if our board of directors so chooses  to repurchase our stock 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to our shareholders 
as noted above  following the amendment to the credit facility and the amendment and restatement of the notes issued in the private placement  we could not pay a dividend until we achieved certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of june   we have achieved the required thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters  and thus are now allowed  if our board of directors so chooses  to reinstate dividend payments 
franchising agreements our agreements with franchise partnerships allow us to purchase an additional equity interest for a specified price 
we have chosen to exercise that option in situations in which we expect to earn a return similar to or better than our expected return from investing in new restaurants 
during fiscal and  we did not exercise our right to acquire an additional equity interest in any franchise partnerships 
we currently have a ownership in seven of our franchise partnerships which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants at june  our franchise agreements with the franchise partnerships allow us to purchase all remaining equity interests beyond the or we already own  for an amount to be calculated based upon a predetermined valuation formula 
we did not exercise our right to acquire the remaining equity interests of any of our franchise partnerships during fiscal and we currently have a ownership in six of our franchise partnerships which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants at june  in early fiscal we anticipate acquiring our long island franchise  a owned franchise partnership  and our new england franchise  a owned franchise partnership  each of which operate ruby tuesday concept restaurants  for a nominal amount of cash plus assumed debt 
to the extent allowable under our debt facilities  we may choose to sell existing restaurants or exercise our rights to acquire an additional equity interest in franchise partnerships in fiscal and beyond 
fiscal year rti s fiscal will contain weeks and end on may  impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  utilities  real estate  and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin is zero to for the base rate loans and a percentage ranging from to for the libo rate based option 
as of june   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of million per year  assuming a consistent capital structure 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
