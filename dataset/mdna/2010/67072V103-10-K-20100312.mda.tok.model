item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative products for the treatment of kidney failure  fluid overload and related blood treatments and procedures 
our primary product  the system one  was designed to satisfy an unmet clinical need for a system that can deliver the therapeutic flexibility and clinical benefits associated with traditional dialysis machines in a smaller  portable  easy to use form that can be used by healthcare professionals and trained lay users alike in a variety of settings  including patient homes  as well as more traditional care settings such as hospitals and dialysis centers 
given its design  the system one is particularly well suited for home hemodialysis and more frequent  or daily  dialysis  which clinical literature suggests provides patients better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life 
the system one is cleared by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for home hemodialysis as well as hospital and clinic based dialysis 
we also sell needles and blood tubing sets primarily to dialysis centers for the treatment of end stage renal disease  or esrd 
we believe our largest future product market opportunity is for our system one used in the home hemodialysis market  or home market  for the treatment of esrd 
we report the results of our operations in two segments the system one segment and the in center segment 
we distribute our products in three markets the home  critical care and in center 
within the system one segment  we offer a similar technology platform of the system one for the home and critical care markets with different features 
the fda has cleared the system one for hemodialysis  hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
we offer primarily needles and blood tubing sets in the in center segment 
our products are predominantly used by our customers to treat patients suffering from esrd or acute kidney failure 
we have marketing and sales efforts dedicated to each market  although nearly all sales in the in center segment are made through distributors 
we received clearance from the fda in july to market the system one for treatment of renal failure and fluid overload using hemodialysis as well as hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
in the first quarter of  we initiated sales of the system one in the critical care market to hospitals and medical centers in the united states 
in late  we initiated sales of the system one for the treatment of patients with esrd 
the fda cleared the system one in june for hemodialysis in the home 
presently  we are pursuing a nocturnal indication for the system one under an ide study started in the first quarter of we recently completed the ide study and have submitted the associated k 
our business expanded significantly in late in connection with the october  acquisition of medisystems corporation and certain affiliated entities  which we refer to as the medisystems acquisition 
with that acquisition  we acquired our needle and blood tubing set product lines for use predominantly in hemodialysis performed in center as well as apheresis  which constitutes our in center segment 
the in center segment is significantly more mature than our system one segment 
medisystems corporation and certain affiliated entities  which we refer to collectively as the mds entities  have been selling products to dialysis centers for the treatment of esrd since  and they have achieved leading positions in the united states 
table of contents market for both blood tubing sets and needles 
our blood tubing set products include the readyset high performance blood tubing set  or readyset  and the streamline airless blood tubing set  or streamline 
readyset has been on the market since streamline is our next generation blood tubing product designed to provide improved patient outcomes and lower costs to dialysis centers 
this product is early in its market launch and adoption has been somewhat limited to date  but growing 
our needle product line includes av fistula needle sets incorporating safety features including masterguard anti stick needle protectors and masterguard technology and buttonhole needle sets 
our av fistula needle sets with masterguard anti stick needle protector were commercially introduced in and our buttonhole needle sets were commercially introduced in our customers  which include dialysis centers and hospitals  receive reimbursement for the dialysis treatments provided with our products typically from medicare and  to a lesser degree  from private insurers 
medicare provides comprehensive and well established reimbursement in the united states for esrd 
reimbursement claims for dialysis therapy using the system one or our blood tubing sets and needles are typically submitted by the dialysis center or hospital to medicare and other third party payors using established billing codes for dialysis treatment or  in the critical care setting  based on the patient s primary diagnosis 
medicare presently limits reimbursement for chronic hemodialysis to three treatments per week  absent a finding of medical justification 
because most of our system one home dialysis patients are treated more than three times a week  expanding medicare reimbursement over time to more predictably cover more frequent therapy may be critical to the market penetration of the system one in the home market and to our revenue growth in the future 
as a result of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of  or mippa legislation  centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  has announced that  in  it will implement a new bundled payment for dialysis treatment 
proposed rules have been released by cms and the public comment period concluded on december  final rules will likely be published in it is not possible at this time to determine what impact this will have on the adoption of home and or daily hemodialysis or the price for which we can sell our products 
the manufacture of our products is accomplished through a complementary combination of outsourcing and internal production 
we have manufacturing facilities in mexico  germany and italy 
we outsource the manufacture of premixed dialysate  needles  some blood tubing sets  and some components 
in our system one segment  we market the system one in the home and critical care markets through a direct sales force in the united states primarily to dialysis centers  for esrd hemodialysis patients  and hospitals 
in our in center segment  we market our blood tubing and needle products primarily through distributors  although we also have a small dedicated sales force for that business 
nearly all in center sales are made to customers in the united states  with very limited amounts sold internationally through distributors 
in may  we announced our first international distribution agreement for the system one with kimal 
to date  substantially all system one segment revenues have been derived from sales within the united states 
under our agreement with kimal  we began selling the system one in the united kingdom and ireland this year  and expect to sell streamline and buttonhole needles through kimal in those territories in the future 
since signing this agreement with kimal  we have continued to expand internationally  recently announcing a five year exclusive distribution agreement with nordic medcom ab for the promotion  sale  delivery and service of the system one and certain of our other products in finland  denmark and sweden and a five year distribution agreement with dirinco for the promotion  sale  delivery and service of the system one and certain of our other products in the netherlands 
since inception  we have incurred losses every quarter  and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase as we grow our business 
while we have achieved positive gross margins for our products  in aggregate  since the fourth quarter of  we cannot provide assurance that our gross margins will improve or  if they do improve  the rate at which they will improve 
we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve profitability  when we will become profitable  the sustainability of profitability  should it occur  or the extent to which we will be profitable 
our ability to become profitable depends principally upon implementing design and process improvements to lower the costs of manufacturing our products  obtaining better purchasing terms and prices  growing revenue  increasing reliability of our products  improving our field equipment utilization  achieving 
table of contents efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain overhead costs  achieving efficiencies in the distribution of our products and achieving a sufficient scale of operations 
we have experienced negative operating margins and cash flows from operations and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future 
we believe  based on current projections  that we have the required resources to fund operating requirements through and beyond 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  continued progress on improving gross margins  the expansion of selling and marketing and research and development activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new geographies or territories  the timing of new product introductions and enhancement to existing products  the continuing market acceptance of products  availability of credit and potential investments in  or acquisitions of complementary businesses  services or technologies 
statement of operations components revenues in the system one segment we derive our revenues from the sale and rental of equipment and the sale of disposable products in the home and critical care markets 
in the home market  customers rent or purchase the system one equipment  including cycler and pureflow sl  and then purchase the related disposable products based on a specific patient prescription 
in the critical care market  we sell or rent the system one and related disposables to hospital customers 
in the in center segment  the majority of revenues are derived from supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
in the home market  for those customers that rent the system one  we recognize revenues on a monthly basis in accordance with customer contracts under which we supply the use of hardware and disposables needed to perform dialysis therapy sessions during a month 
for customers that purchase the system one in the home market  we recognize revenue from the equipment sale ratably over the expected service obligation period and recognize disposable product revenue upon delivery 
our contracts with dialysis centers for esrd home dialysis patients generally include terms providing for the sale of disposable products to accommodate up to the number of prescribed treatments per month per patient and the purchase or monthly rental of system one cyclers and  in some instances  our pureflow sl hardware 
the terms of these contracts vary  and are automatically renewed on a month to month basis thereafter  subject to a day termination notice 
under these contracts  if home hemodialysis is prescribed  supplies are shipped directly to patient homes and paid for by the treating dialysis center 
we also include vacation delivery terms  providing for the shipment of products to a designated vacation destination for a specified number of vacation days 
we derive an insignificant amount of revenues from the sale of ancillary products  such as extra lengths of tubing 
over time  as more home patients are treated with the system one and more systems are placed in patient homes that provide for the purchase or rental of the machine and the purchase of the related disposables  we expect this recurring revenue stream to continue to grow 
a number of our home market customers  including davita  have purchased system one equipment  with certain customers committed to purchase  rather than rent  the significant majority of their future system one equipment requirements 
there can  however  be no assurance that we will be able to expand the percentage of our equipment placements that are purchased rather than rented 
our critical care contracts with hospitals generally include terms providing for the sale of our system one hardware and disposables  although we also provide a hardware rental option 
we recognize revenue from direct product sales at the later of the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
these contracts typically have a term of one year 
we expect  at least in the near term  as hospitals face continued pressure to reduce capital spending  increasingly more of our sales will include the rental rather than the sale of our system one hardware than we have experienced in the past 
we derive a small amount of revenue from the sale of one and two year service contracts following the expiration of our standard one year warranty period for system one hardware 
to further support service in this market  we have implemented a bio medical training program  whereby we train bio medical engineers on how to service and repair certain aspects of the system one in the critical care setting 
bio medical training is not offered for the home market within our system one segment 
bio medical training is typically provided under a two year contract 
table of contents following the expiration of our standard one year warranty period for system one hardware 
similar to our home market  as more system one equipment is placed within hospitals  we expect to derive a growing recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable cartridges and fluids for use with our placed system one equipment as well as  to a much lesser degree  from the sale of service and bio medical training contracts 
our in center segment revenues are highly concentrated in several significant purchasers 
revenues from henry schein  our primary distributor  represented approximately of our in center segment revenues during and approximately during and during the third quarter of  we began selling blood tubing sets to gambro 
revenues from our other significant distributors  including gambro  over each of the same periods were  and of our in center segment revenues  respectively 
sales to davita  through henry schein and gambro represent a significant percentage of these revenues 
davita has contractual purchase commitments under two agreements one for blood tubing sets and one for needles 
davita s purchase obligations with respect to needles will expire under an agreement with us in january under our recently signed gambro agreement  gambro has contractually committed to exclusively supply our blood tubing sets in the united states to davita through july gambro s long term product supply agreement with davita entered into in connection with the sale of gambro s united states dialysis clinic business to davita  obligates davita to purchase a significant majority of its product requirements from gambro 
our in center segment revenues are subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in sales volumes and variations in inventory management policies of our distributors and end users 
we regularly monitor the amount of inventory held by distributors to ensure it is not excessive when compared to end user demand 
some of the distribution contracts for our in center segment offer rebates based on sales to specific end customers and discount incentives for early payment 
our revenues are presented net of these rebates  incentives  discounts and returns 
as of december   we had million reserved against trade accounts receivable for future sales incentives 
we recorded million  million and million during  and  respectively  as a reduction of sales in connection with sales incentives 
our distribution agreement with henry schein  our primary distributor for the in center segment  originally scheduled to expire in july  has been extended on a non exclusive basis while the parties work to negotiate a new agreement 
if we are unable to negotiate a renewal  we will need to seek alternative distribution relationships or to sell our in center segment products directly to end users 
our agreements with two other distributors for the in center segment are scheduled to expire in july and february  respectively 
our blood tubing set distribution agreement with gambro expires in july davita continues to be our most significant customer for both segments 
we have long term purchase agreements directly or indirectly covering product sales to davita in the in center segment  however  the initial term of our long term agreement with davita for the purchase of the system one in the home market expired on december  we are currently working with davita to negotiate the terms of a new agreement for the home market  however  there can be no assurance that we will enter into a new agreement for the home market with davita or regarding the terms of any such agreement 
our february  agreement with davita contemplates ongoing sales of products following december  the loss of any of this business  at least in the near term  would have an adverse effect on our business 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct product costs  including material and labor required to manufacture our products  service of system one equipment that we rent and sell to customers and production overhead 
it also includes the cost of inspecting  servicing and repairing system one equipment prior to sale or during the warranty period and related stock based compensation 
the cost of our products depends on several factors  including the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  the cost at which we can obtain labor and products from third party suppliers  product reliability and related servicing costs and the design of our products 

table of contents operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for sales and marketing personnel  travel  promotional and marketing materials and other expenses associated with providing clinical training to our customers 
included in selling and marketing are the costs of clinical educators  usually nurses  we employ to teach our customers about our products and prepare our customers to instruct their patients and their partners in the operation of our products 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for research and development personnel  supplies  materials and expenses associated with product design and development  clinical studies  regulatory submissions  reporting and compliance and expenses incurred for outside consultants or firms who furnish services related to these activities 
distribution 
distribution expenses include the freight costs of delivering our products to our customers or our customers patients  depending on the market and the specific agreements with our customers  salary  benefits and stock based compensation for distribution personnel and the cost of any equipment lost or damaged in the distribution process 
we use common carriers and freight companies to deliver our products and we do not operate our own delivery service 
also included in this category are the expenses of shipping products under warranty from customers back to our service center for repair and the related expense of shipping a replacement product to our customers or their patients 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for our executive management  legal and finance and accounting staff  fees of outside legal counsel  fees for our annual audit and tax services  and general expenses to operate the business  including insurance and other corporate related expenses

table of contents in the home market  revenues increased million  or  in compared to as a result of an increase in the number of patients prescribed to use and centers offering the system one 
during we increased the average number of patients at existing centers and the number of total centers offering the system one 
critical care market revenues increased million  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of sales of additional system one units  the growth of our installed base of units and the associated sales of disposables due to our efforts to continue to penetrate the market 
future demand for our products in both the home and critical care markets is expected to remain strong due to the life sustaining  non elective nature of dialysis therapy 
revenues in the home market are expected to continue to increase as we further penetrate the market place and as we expand internationally 
however  in the critical care market  we expect  at least in the short term  to see a continuation of a conservative capital spending environment as hospitals face pressure to reduce capital spending 
in center segment revenues increased million  or  in compared to the increase in revenues was due to higher sales volumes of our blood tubing sets including streamline  our newest blood tubing set product line 
we expect future demand will be susceptible to fluctuation as a result of increased competition and variations in inventory management policies with both our distributors and end users 
cost of revenues and gross profit our cost of revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage change change system one segment in center segment total cost of revenue gross profit for the system one segment increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in gross profit was a result of increased revenues  improvements in reliability and equipment utilization and lower overall costs of manufacturing as we continue to realize the benefits of leveraging our manufacturing infrastructure  certain cost saving initiatives such as the transition of manufacturing and equipment service to lower cost labor markets  and improvements in product design and reliability 
gross profit for the in center segment increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in gross profit was due to lower manufacturing costs resulting from the benefits of certain manufacturing process improvements and product design improvements 
we expect the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue to decline over time for three general reasons 
first  we expect to introduce additional process improvements and product design changes that have inherently lower cost than our current products 
second  we expect to continue to improve product reliability  which would reduce service costs 
finally  we anticipate that increased volume and realization of economies of scale will lead to better purchasing terms and prices and efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain overhead costs 
we cannot  however  guarantee that we will achieve our expected cost reduction plans 
selling and marketing our selling and marketing expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages december  december  percentage change change system one segment in center segment total selling and marketing 
table of contents the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily the result of increased personnel and personnel related costs  including non cash stock based compensation expense due to expanded sales and marketing and customer service functions 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we broaden our marketing initiatives to increase public awareness of the system one in the home market and other products  particularly streamline  in the in center segment  and as we add additional sales support and marketing personnel  but decrease as a percent of revenues as we continue to leverage our existing infrastructure 
research and development our research and development expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage change change research and development the increase in research and development expenses was primarily a result of increased personnel and personnel related costs  including non cash stock based compensation expense  due to increased headcount 
additionally  clinical trials expenses have increased due to increased patient enrollment in our nocturnal ide and freedom studies 
we expect research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenues in the foreseeable future as we seek to further enhance our system one and related products  and their reliability  and with the increased activity associated with our freedom study 
distribution our distribution expenses for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  december  percentage change change system one segment in center segment total distribution the decrease in distribution expenses was primarily a result of better pricing obtained from carriers and shipping efficiencies 
distribution expenses for the system one segment remained relatively consistent year over year but decreased as a percentage of revenues from during to during  due primarily to better pricing obtained from carriers  shipping efficiencies and improved reliability of our system one and pureflow sl hardware 
distribution expenses for the in center segment decreased due to shipping efficiencies 
we expect that distribution expenses will continue to increase at a lower rate than revenues due to expected efficiencies gained from increased business volume  better pricing obtained from carriers  increased volume  customer adoption of our pureflow sl hardware  which significantly reduces the weight and quantity of monthly disposable shipments  and improved reliability of system one equipment 
we cannot predict the estimated impact  if any  of fuel costs on future distribution costs

the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased personnel and personnel related costs  including non cash stock based compensation expense  offset by a decreases in external services expense resulting from cost savings measures 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat in the near term as we continue to leverage our existing infrastructure 
other income and expense interest income decreased million in compared to due to lower interest rates on investments 
interest income is derived primarily from investments in money market funds 
interest expense increased million in compared to due primarily to prepayment and other transaction fees of million incurred during to pay off the entire debt obligation owed under our credit and security agreement with general electric capital corporation and an increase in outstanding borrowings

provision for foreign income taxes the provision for income taxes of million in and million in relates to the profitable operations of certain of our foreign entities acquired in the medisystems acquisition on october  liquidity and capital resources we have operated at a loss since our inception in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operating activities  product development and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and ongoing revenues 
a number of our home market customers  including davita  have purchased system one equipment  with certain customers committed to purchase  rather than rent  the significant majority of their future system one equipment requirements 
there can  however  be no assurance that we will be able to expand the percentage of our equipment placements that are purchased rather than rented 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million 
a significant factor affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements is our ability to execute upon cost reduction initiatives to lower product cost 
we have the flexibility under our term loan with asahi to seek up to million in additional debt at market interest rates to fund our growth objectives 
on march   we entered into a loan and security agreement  the agreement  with silicon valley bank  svb  for a million revolving line of credit with a maturity date of april  the agreement is secured by all or substantially all of our assets 
in connection with this agreement  we amended our term loan and security agreement with asahi to provide for certain amendments  including granting to asahi junior liens on certain of our assets for so long as the agreement with svb remains outstanding 
upon termination of all obligations under that facility  asahi s security will revert to a security in all assets other than cash  bank accounts  accounts receivable  field equipment and inventory 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to two percentage points above the prime rate initial prime rate of 
pursuant to the agreement  we have agreed to certain financial covenants relating to liquidity requirements and adjusted ebitda  as defined in our agreement with svb 
the agreement contains events of default customary for transactions of this type  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants  material adverse effect and bankruptcy 
we did not draw any amounts under the agreement at closing  but may do so in the future to fund working capital and operating requirements 
in may  we entered into a series of agreements with asahi 
the agreements are multi faceted and include a term loan in which asahi agreed to provide us with million of debt financing 
the term loan bears interest at a rate of per annum  with fifty percent of such interest being deferred until the maturity date on may  principal is payable in one balloon payment at maturity 
the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in the event the term loan reaches maturity  asahi may require that all of the principal and interest on the term loan that is unpaid as of the maturity date be converted into shares of our common stock  with the number of shares to be determined based upon the average closing stock price of our common stock during the thirty business days preceding the maturity date  subject to certain conditions 
we used million of the proceeds to pay off the entire debt obligation  including prepayment and other transaction fees  owed under our credit and security agreement with general electric capital corporation 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds for operating purposes 
in connection with entering into the loan and security agreement with svb  we amended the term loan and security agreement with asahi to provide for secondary liens on the svb collateral 
the term loan agreement with asahi includes certain affirmative covenants including timely filings and limitations on contingent debt obligations and sales of assets 
the term loan and security agreement also contains customary events of default  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants  material adverse effects  and bankruptcy 
in the event we fail to satisfy our covenants  or otherwise go into default  asahi has a number of remedies  including sale of our assets and acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness 
any of these remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents on may   we entered into a million private placement agreement to sell an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the exercise price of the warrants was fixed at per share on december  based on the company s ability to achieve over  esrd patients prescribed to receive therapy using the system one 
the warrants have a term of years and expire on may  and august  for the first and second tranches respectively 
the warrants also contain a net share settlement feature that is available to investors once the underlying shares are registered 
additional provisions require the company  in the event of a change of control  to pay promptly to the warrant holder an amount calculated by the black scholes option pricing formula 
such payment is required to be in cash or shares in the same proportion that other stockholders receive in such change of control transaction 
we maintain postemployment benefit plans for employees in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the plans provide lump sum benefits  payable based on statutory regulations for voluntary or involuntary termination 
where required  we obtain an annual actuarial valuation of the benefit plans 
we have recorded a liability of million as other long term liabilities at december  for costs associated with these plans 
the expense recorded in connection with these plans was not significant during  or the following table sets forth the components of our cash flows for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities foreign exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents net cash flow net cash used in operating activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in operating activities was attributable primarily to net losses after adjustment for non cash charges  such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
net cash used in operating activities decreased by million and million during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities during both periods were primarily due to a decrease in our net loss after adjustments for non cash charges  as we continue to reduce product costs  and a decrease in inventory purchases for the production and placement of system one and pureflow sl hardware as a result of reduced costs and improved reliability 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities during was offset by an increase in cash used for accounts payable due to timing of vendor payments 
deferred revenues increased million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in deferred revenues was primarily a result of purchases of system one equipment by certain customers  including davita  offset by the amortization of million  million and million during  and  respectively  of deferred revenues into revenues 
non cash transfers from inventory to field equipment for the placement of rental units with our customers represented million  million and million  respectively  during the years ended december   and the decrease is primarily due to lower equipment costs  improved equipment reliability and our continued effort to improve equipment utilization 
non cash transfers from field equipment to deferred costs of sales for sales of units to customers represented million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in provided by investing activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment  primarily for research and development  information technology  manufacturing operations and capital improvements to our facilities 
during  net cash provided by investing activities included million of proceeds from short term investments and million of costs to acquire medisystems 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million during and increased by million during the twelve months ended december  
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities during included million of borrowings under our term loan with asahi offset by million in fees paid in connection with the asahi debt issuance  million in repayments of borrowings under our credit and security agreement with ge and a million amendment fee paid in connection with the march  amendment to our credit and security agreement with ge

net cash provided by financing activities during included million of net proceeds received from the sale to davita of our common stock  million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants and net borrowings of million 
we have experienced negative operating margins and cash flows from operations and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future 
we believe  based on current projections  that we have the required resources to fund operating requirements through and beyond 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  continued progress on improving gross margins  the expansion of selling and marketing and research and development activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new geographies or territories  the timing of new product introductions and enhancement to existing products  the continuing market acceptance of products  availability of credit and potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  and the effect those commitments are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than total one year years years years debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations total long term debt obligations include the aggregate outstanding principle amount under our million term loan with asahi and related deferred interest and estimated interest payments 
our purchase obligations include purchase commitments for system one components  primarily for equipment  blood tubing sets  needles  and fluids pursuant to contractual agreements with several of our suppliers 
certain of these commitments may be extended and or canceled at our option 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
a summary of those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales and services when earned 
revenues are recognized when a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the product has been shipped or services and supplies have been provided to the customer  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
certain agreements with distributors allow for product returns and credits 
for shipment of product sold to distributors  revenue is recognized at the time of sale if a reasonable estimate of future returns or refunds can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of future returns or refunds cannot be made  we recognize revenue using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  revenue and related costs of revenue is deferred until the final resale of such products to end customers 
system one segment we derive revenue in the home market from the sales of hemodialysis therapy to customers in which the customer either purchases or rents the system one and pureflow sl hardware and purchases a specified number of disposable products and  in some instances  service 
under the rental arrangements  which combine the use of the system one and pureflow sl hardware with a specified number of disposable products supplied to customers for a fixed price per month  revenue is recognized on a monthly basis in accordance with agreed upon contract terms and pursuant to binding customer purchase orders and fixed payment terms 
for customers that purchase the system one and pureflow sl hardware  we must determine whether a the equipment has stand alone value and b the fair value of the undelivered items  typically the disposables and  in some instances service  can be determined 
if either criteria is not met  which is generally the case  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the fees received upon the completion of delivery of equipment are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our remaining obligation and direct costs relating to the delivered equipment are amortized over the same period as the related revenue  while disposable products revenue is recognized on a monthly basis upon delivery 
if both criteria are met  then the items are accounted for separately as delivered 
in the critical care market  we structure sales of the system one as direct product sales 
we recognize revenue from direct product sales at the later of the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
our contracts for the system one in the critical care market provide for training  technical support and warranty services to our customers 
we recognize training and technical support revenue when the related services are performed 
in the case of extended warranty  the revenue is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
in center segment in the in center segment  nearly all sales to end users are structured through supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
some of our distribution contracts for the in center segment contain minimum volume commitments with negotiated pricing discounts at different volume tiers 
each agreement may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights  and in many instances minimum volume commitments can be reduced or eliminated upon certain events 
in addition to contractually determined volume discounts  in many agreements we offer rebates based on sales to specific end customers and discount incentives for early payment 
discounts and incentives are 
table of contents recorded as a reduction of sales and trade accounts receivable  based on our best estimate of the amount of probable future rebate or discount on current sales 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or estimated market 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and related cost and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on an estimated forecast of product demand for each of our existing product configurations 
we also review our inventory value to determine if it reflects lower of cost or market  with market determined based on net realizable value 
appropriate consideration is given to inventory items sold at negative gross margins  purchase commitments and other factors in evaluating net realizable value 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid development and technological advances as well as regulatory and quality manufacturing guidelines that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate 
field equipment field equipment consists of equipment being utilized under disposable based rental agreements as well as service pool cyclers 
service pool cyclers are cyclers owned and maintained by us that are swapped for cyclers that need repairs or maintenance by us while being rented or owned by a patient 
we continually monitor the number of cyclers in the service pool  as well as cyclers that are in transit or otherwise not being used by a patient  and assess whether there are any indicators of impairment for such equipment 
we capitalize field equipment at cost and amortize field equipment through cost of revenues using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
we review the estimated useful life of five years periodically for reasonableness 
factors considered in determining the reasonableness of the useful life include industry practice and the typical amortization periods used for like equipment  the frequency and scope of service returns and the impact of planned design improvements 
we also review field equipment carrying value for reasonableness 
we consider factors such as actual equipment disposals and our ability to verify the equipment s existence in the field to identify lost equipment 
charges for lost equipment are included in distribution expenses 
accounting for stock based awards stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which generally equals the vesting period  based on the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including the expected term of our stock options  volatility of our stock  expected dividends  risk free interest rates over the expected term of the options and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our restricted stock programs  we make assumptions principally related to the number of awards that are expected to vest 
intangibles and other long lived assets intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets 
furthermore  for our long lived assets including intangible assets  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if an impairment review is triggered  we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 

table of contents goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
goodwill may be considered impaired if we determine that the carrying value of our reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
our reporting units are our system one and in center operating segments 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments including the identification of reporting units and determination of the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
we estimate reporting unit fair value using a discounted cash flow approach which requires the use of assumptions and judgments including estimates of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates 
our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur 
however  changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values of reporting units 
accounting for income taxes we record the tax effect of transactions when such transactions are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax asset has been established as of december  and to reflect these uncertainties 
we periodically assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the position changes  if the matter is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation expires  the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change  resolution or expiration occurs 
we file federal  state and foreign tax returns 
we have accumulated significant losses since our inception in since the net operating losses may potentially be utilized in future years to reduce taxable income  all of our tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
related party transactions on june   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with david s 
utterberg  a director and significant stockholder  under which we agreed to purchase from mr 
utterberg the issued and outstanding shares of medisystems corporation and certain affiliated entities  which we refer to as the mds entities  in exchange for the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
we may be required to issue additional shares of common stock to mr 
utterberg because  pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement  mr 
utterberg and we have agreed to indemnify each other in the event of certain breaches or failures  and any such indemnification amounts must be paid in shares of our common stock  valued at the time of payment 
however  we will not be required to issue shares for indemnification purposes that in the aggregate would exceed of the then outstanding shares of our common stock without first obtaining stockholder approval  and any such shares will not be registered under the securities act of  as amended 
the stock purchase agreement provided that an aggregate of one million shares would be held back in escrow to secure any indemnification obligations of mr 
utterberg for a period of two years 
all shares have been released from escrow  consistent with the terms of the escrow agreement entered into between the parties 
in connection with the acquisition of the mds entities we assumed a million liability owed to dsu medical corporation  or dsu  a nevada corporation  which is wholly owned by mr 
utterberg 
we paid the liability during as a condition to the parties obligations to consummate the medisystems acquisition  mr 
utterberg and dsu 
table of contents entered into a consulting agreement with us  dated october  we paid mr 
utterberg and dsu   and  during  and  respectively  in consideration for services performed under this agreement 
finally  in connection with the medisystems acquisition  we also agreed that if mr 
utterberg is no longer a director of nxstage  our board of directors will nominate for election to our board of directors any director nominee proposed by mr 
utterberg  subject to certain conditions 
on may   we entered into securities purchase agreements relating to a private placement of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the private placement took place in two closings  on may  and august   and raised million and million  respectively  in gross proceeds 
participants in the private placement consisted of unaffiliated and affiliated accredited institutional investors 
one of these investors  the sprout group  is affiliated with one of our board members  dr 
philippe o 
chambon 
the sprout group purchased million shares and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price similar to that of unaffiliated investors 
under applicable rules of the nasdaq global market  the second closing of the private placement  which included all shares issued to the sprout group and other affiliated accredited institutional investors  was subject to stockholder approval  which was obtained at a special meeting on july  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with orbimed advisors  llc  or orbimed  in connection with the private placement which required that we appoint one individual nominated by orbimed to our board of directors upon the earlier of the second closing of the private placement or sixty days after the first closing of the private placement 
the appointment of mr 
jonathan silverstein  a general partner of orbimed  on july   to the board satisfied this requirement 
orbimed purchased an aggregate of million shares and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock in connection with the private placement at a price similar to that of unaffiliated investors 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard update regarding business combinations 
as codified under accounting standards codification  or asc   this update provides that  upon initially obtaining control  an acquirer shall recognize percent of the fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired percent of its target 
as a consequence  the step acquisition model will be eliminated 
additionally  it changes current practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements will be recorded at their estimated fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs will be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value to the extent that such value can be objectively determined  in process research and development will be capitalized and either amortized over the life of the product or written off if the project is abandoned or impaired  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense  and restructuring costs generally will be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date 
since this accounting update is applicable to future acquisitions completed after january  and we have not had any business combinations subsequent to january  to date  the adoption of this update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
this accounting update also amended accounting for uncertainty in income taxes such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of asc would also follow the provisions of this update 
thus  all changes to valuation allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions established in purchase accounting will be recognized in current period income tax expense 
effective january   we adopted an accounting standard update as codified under asc that requires the application of a two step approach in evaluating whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to a company s own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent 
table of contents exercise and settlement provisions  and must be applied to all instruments outstanding on the date of adoption 
the adoption of this update did not have an impact our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we adopted an accounting standard update as codified under asc which provides guidelines for making fair value measurements more consistent and provides additional authoritative guidance in determining whether a market is active or inactive  and whether a transaction is distressed this guidance is applicable to all assets and liabilities ie financial and nonfinancial and will require enhanced disclosures 
the adoption of this update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we adopted a new accounting standard update as codified under asc this update requires expanded disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements and also requires those disclosures in all interim financial statements 
the adoption of this standard has resulted in the enhanced disclosure of the fair values attributable to debt instruments within this annual report 
since this update addresses disclosure requirements  the adoption of this update did not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effective april   we adopted an accounting standard update as codified under asc  which provides additional guidance to provide greater clarity about the credit and noncredit component of an other than temporary impairment event related to debt securities and to more effectively communicate when an other than temporary impairment event has occurred 
the adoption of this update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective june   we adopted a new accounting standard for subsequent events as codified in asc the update provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of this standard did not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effective july   we adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  or asc this standard establishes only two levels of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  authoritative and nonauthoritative 
the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  asc became the source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became nonauthoritative 
we began using the new guidelines and numbering system prescribed by the codification when referring to gaap in the third quarter of fiscal as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued the following new accounting standard which has not yet been integrated into the codification  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas accordingly  sfas will remain authoritative until integrated 
sfas prescribes the information that a reporting entity must provide in its financial reports about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
specifically  among other aspects  sfas amends sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  or sfas  by removing the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity from sfas and removes the exception from applying fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised  or fin r  to variable interest entities that are qualifying special purpose entities 
it also modifies the financial components approach used in sfas sfas is effective for transfer of financial assets occurring on or after january  we have not determined the effect the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements  but the effect will be limited to future transactions 
in august  the fasb issued update no 
 which amends asc to provide further guidance on how to measure the fair value of a liability  an area where practitioners have been seeking further guidance 
it primarily does three things sets forth the types of valuation techniques to be used to value a 
table of contents liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability and clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
the update became effective during our fourth quarter of the adoption of this update did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  or asu it updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc  which originated primarily from the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
the update will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we are currently assessing the future impact of this new accounting update to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued update no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  or asu it amends asc such that tangible products  containing both software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality  are no longer within the scope of asc it also amends the determination of how arrangement consideration should be allocated to deliverables in a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement 
this asu will become effective for us for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after april  earlier application is permitted with required transition disclosures based on the period of adoption 
the adoption of this update will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have concluded the software component of our tangible products to be incidental 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
our investments are subject to changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 

table of contents foreign currency exposure we operate a manufacturing and research facility in germany as well as manufacturing facilities in italy and mexico 
we purchase materials for those facilities and pay our employees at those facilities in euros and pesos 
in addition  we purchase products for resale in the united states from foreign companies and have agreed to pay them in currencies other than the us dollar  including the euro and peso 
we also have contracts with key suppliers that expose us to foreign currency risks 
as a result  our expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we incur expenses  our foreign currency based expenses increase when translated into us dollars 
although it is possible to do so and we may in the future  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency transactions since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results 
a movement in the euro and peso would have an overall impact to the statement of operations of approximately million for  which would have been approximately of total annual expenses
