item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview we are an alternative energy technology company that provides technology  equipment and engineering services for the conversion of low rank  low cost coal and biomass feedstocks into energy and chemical products 
our strategy is to create value through providing technology and equipment in regions where low rank coals and biomass feedstocks can be profitably converted into high value products through our proprietary u gas fluidized bed gasification technology 
we do this through providing a proprietary technology package whereby we license u gas technology rights to third parties  deliver an engineered technology transfer package and provide proprietary equipment components to customers who plan to own and operate projects 
in addition  we may i integrate our u gas technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering where we may invest in projects either directly or through an investment partner  ii partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our u gas technology package into an integrated modular product offering  iii provide technology to enable coal resources to be integrated together with our u gas technology where the coal resources may be of little value without our u gas conversion technology  or iv acquire or partner with owners of these coal resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the coal resources 
we believe that we have several advantages over commercially available competing gasification technologies  such as entrained flow  fixed and moving bed gasification technologies  including our ability to use all ranks of coals including low rank  high ash and high moisture coals  which are significantly cheaper than higher grade coals  many coal waste products and biomass feed stocks 
in addition  u gas technology s advanced fluidized bed design is tolerant to changes in feedstock 
these factors enable us to be a lower cost producer of synthesis gas  or syngas  a mixture of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide  which can then be used to produce other products 
depending on local market need and fuel sources  syngas can be used as a fuel gas in industrial applications or can be used to produce many products including power  synthetic natural gas  or sng  methanol  dimethyl ether  or dme  glycol  ammonia  direct reduction iron  or dri  synthetic gasoline  steam  and other byproducts eg  sulphur  carbon dioxide or ash 
our principal operating activities are currently in china  however  we are developing opportunities in other countries including the us  india  europe  australia and vietnam  as well as other parts of europe and asia to provide our u gas technology package 
our zao zhuang project is our first commercial scale coal gasification plant located in shandong province  china and has been in operation since february and in commercial operation since december our yima project is currently under construction in henan province  china 
the key elements of our business strategy include executing on existing projects in china 
we are continuing to implement operational measures to improve the financial performance of our zao zhuang project in the near term  while also continuing to evaluate alternatives to better position the project to be commercially and financially successful in the future 
these alternatives include the possible expansion of the plant to produce other products for other customers 
we also intend to continue to leverage our success to date at the zz joint venture in our ongoing business development efforts  including through further visits from senior executives of possible customers and partners  as well as government officials  from china  india  australia  vietnam and the united states 
we are also continuing the ongoing construction of our yima project  and are working to restructure our joint venture agreements to change the scope of the project from methanol to glycol production 
leveraging our proprietary technology through licensing  equipment sales and related services to increase revenues and position us for future growth 
we provide a proprietary technology package whereby we license u gas technology rights to third parties  deliver an engineered technology transfer package and provide proprietary equipment components to customers who plan to own and operate projects 
we intend to focus on developing opportunities for our proprietary technology package whereby we may i integrate our u gas technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering where we may invest in projects either directly or through an investment partner or ii may partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our u gas technology package into an integrated modular product offering  which may include coal or biomass feedstocks for units producing power and fuels such as sng  mtg  diesel and ethanol as well as methanol for gasoline blending 
we anticipate that we can increase revenues through collecting technology licensing fees and royalties  engineering and technical service fees  as well as equipment product sales sold to customers who plan to own and operate projects and desire to incorporate our proprietary technology 
we also believe that our licensing activities will provide additional insight into project development activities  which may allow us to make selective equity investments in such projects in the future  develop integrated  modular product offerings  or take options in projects for which we provide a license 

table of contents expanding our relationships with strong strategic partners 
our efforts have been initially focused on facilities producing syngas  methanol and dme in china 
we are expanding our relationships with our current partners  developing new relationships with strategic partners and developing new downstream coal to chemicals and coal to energy products which may expand our initial focus to include facilities producing sng  methanol to gasoline  or mtg  glycol  power and reducing gas for the steel industry 
we are exploring new markets for entry such as the us  india  australia  vietnam  and other parts of europe and asia 
such strategic relationships may include an investment in projects either directly by us or through an investment partner where u gas plants may supply syngas to strategic customers via long term offtake agreements 
developing value where we have a competitive advantage and have access of rights to feedstock resources 
we believe that we have the greatest competitive advantage using our u gas technology in situations where there is a ready source of low rank  low cost coal  coal waste or biomass to utilize as a feedstock 
we are focusing our efforts in countries with large low rank coal resources such as india  the us  china  turkey and australia 
we are working to develop structured transactions that include securing options to these feedstock resources 
for example  we are currently in discussions regarding several projects in inner mongolia  china where the provincial government is making coal resources available to the project owners which adds protection for the project from future coal cost increases  as well as potentially increasing project revenues 
in these cases  we may provide technology to add value to coal resources which may be of little value without our u gas conversion technology or may acquire or partner with owners of these resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the resources 
additionally  where capital and or financing is available  we may acquire an interest in such resources  including existing facilities or coal mines  where we could create value with our u gas technology through securing greater access to feedstock 
continue to develop and improve u gas technology 
we are continually seeking to improve the overall plant availability  plant efficiency rates and fuel handling capabilities of the existing u gas gasification technology 
we are continuing to work with our prospective customers to determine the suitability of their low rank coals for our u gas technology through our proprietary coal characterization testing as well as selective commercial scale testing in our zao zhuang facility 
in addition  we are growing our technology base through continued development of know how with our engineering and technical staff  growing and protecting our trade secrets as well as through patenting improvements tested at our zao zhuang facility  and improvements resulting from integration of our technology with downstream processes 
to date  we have filed patent applications relating to our improvements to the u gas technology 
grow earnings through increased revenues and control of expenses 
we remain intently focused on control of our expenses while we grow revenues from our technology business 
we believe our strategy will allow us to grow near term revenues to position us for sustainable long term growth 
we intend to minimize project development expense on projects until we have assurances that acceptable financing is available to complete the project 
until the capital markets improve  our strategy will be to operate using our current capital resources and to leverage the resources of financing partners 
results of operations we are in our development stage and therefore have had limited operations 
we generated revenues of million for the year ended june  we have sustained net losses of approximately million from november   the date of our inception  to june  we have primarily financed our operations to date through private placements and two public offerings of our common stock 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue 
total revenue increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  product sales were million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were derived primarily from the sale of syngas and other byproducts produced at the zz joint venture plant in china 
product revenues have increased at the plant due to the plant s increased availability for production  increased syngas volume offtake by our customer  hai hua  and increased byproduct sales  including sales of our excess oxygen to hai hua under our asu cost sharing arrangement  which sales commenced in september for the year ended june   the zz joint venture plant operated for of the period and was available for production for of the period 
plant operations and syngas production has been limited primarily due to extended shutdowns by hai hua 
although the syngas volume offtake by hai hua has increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  to date  hai hua has been unable to offtake the volume of syngas originally expected for the original plant design and we do not foresee this situation changing significantly in the near term 
the zz joint venture plant was in its commissioning phase prior to achieving commercial operations status in december 
table of contents other related party revenue during the year ended june  of approximately million was generated for engineering services provided to the yima joint ventures during the year ended june  there was no other related party revenue during the year ended june  technology licensing and related services revenues were million for the year ended june  and were generated from feasibility studies and other technical services provided in association with our technology licensing business 
there were no technology licensing and related services revenues during the year ended june  other revenues were million for the year ended june  and related to a sponsorship grant for lignite testing at the zz joint venture plant 
other revenues were million for the year ended june  and were generated by a feasibility study for a project in the us that has since been cancelled 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were comprised principally of coal consumption  electricity  and other operating costs at the zz joint venture plant 
the increase is due to a significant increase in syngas production during the year ended june  a majority of the costs during the year ended june  were incurred prior to the plant achieving commercial operations status in december general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs as a result of reduced staffing levels  and a decrease in consulting and professional fees 
project and technical development expenses 
project and technical development expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  project development expenses for the year ended june  included a million charge for a consulting fee related to the financial closing of the yima project 
other expenses included costs for u gas technology development which included advanced analytical flow modeling and other technical support and development costs 
asset impairment losses 
an asset impairment loss of million during the year ended june  related to the write off of the long lived assets of the gc joint venture 
the period included a million impairment loss on a royalty deposit paid to exxonmobil during the three months ended december  and a non cash charge to write off the million remaining carrying value of the reservation and use fee paid to gti 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the period included a credit of approximately million due to the reversal of previously recognized expense due to forfeitures related to cancellations of terminated employees stock option awards 
excluding the effect of this credit  stock based compensation expense decreased because the amount of stock based compensation expense associated with recent grants of stock option awards is lower than certain prior awards due to the decrease in the price of our common stock 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased by million to million during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the decrease was due principally to the change in the estimated useful live of the production equipment at the zz joint venture plant from a period of years to years effective october  and a reduction in equipment costs of approximately million due to settlement with a construction vendor 
equity in losses of yima joint ventures 
the equity in losses of the yima joint ventures for the year ended june  relates to our share of the loss incurred by the yima joint ventures 
the loss is comprised of non capitalizable costs incurred during the design and construction phase  offset in part  by interest income earned on invested funds contributed by us and yima 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to lower yields earned on cash equivalent investments and lower invested principal balances 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to the zz joint venture s lower outstanding principal balance on its loan with the industrial and commercial bank of china and to a lower interest rate based on the annual adjustment in march to 
this rate was not adjusted in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  the increase resulted principally from golden concord absorbing their interest in the asset impairment loss 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue 
product sales increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were derived from the sale of syngas and byproducts produced at the zz joint venture plant 
the plant s initial syngas sales commenced during the three months ended march  product sales of million were recognized during the three months ended june  as the plant operated for approximately of the period and was available for production for approximately of the period 
although the plant declared commercial operations in december  hai hua did not begin paying the zz joint venture for the energy and capacity fees until may due to differing interpretations between hai hua and the zz joint venture regarding certain syngas quality components requirements under the contract 
during the three months ended march   the plant was only operating for approximately of the period due to an unscheduled maintenance outage  repairs related to a power outage  a local area government industrial inspection  and scheduled maintenance by hai hua 
other revenues were million for the year ended june  and were generated by a feasibility study for a project in the us that has since been cancelled 
cost of sales and plant operating expenses 
cost of sales and plant operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were comprised principally of coal consumption  electricity  maintenance and other operating costs at the zz joint venture plant 
the plant s initial operations commenced during the three months ended march  costs were higher during the year ended june  due to the plant operating for a longer period of time and due to costs incurred to enable the plant to declare commercial operations status in december general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee compensation as a result of increased staffing levels during the first half of fiscal  professional fees  travel and other expenses 
during the second half of fiscal  we made significant workforce and other cost reductions which reduced general and administrative expenses by as compared to the first half of fiscal general and administrative expenses included our internal project development and engineering staffing costs which have supported development of our yima project and other projects 
project and technical development expenses 
project and technical development expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  due primarily to a reduction in us project and technical development activities and a million reimbursement from consol energy  inc  or consol  in full settlement of its cost sharing arrangement under our joint development agreement with consol 
project and technical development expenses incurred during the period related principally to the yima project  the feasibility study with north american coal  or nac  for the development of a coal based gasification facility at nac s proposed otter creek mine in north dakota and our project with consol  both of which were cancelled 
asset impairment losses 
asset impairment losses of million during the year ended june  related a million impairment loss on a royalty deposit paid to exxonmobil during the three months ended december  and a non cash charge to write off the million remaining carrying value of the reservation and use fee paid to gti 
the gti reservation and use fee was paid for with shares of our common stock during fiscal to reserve the facility for calendar and stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  for the year ended june   stock based compensation expense included a reduction of approximately million due to the reversal of previously recognized expense due to forfeitures related to cancellations of terminated employees stock option awards 
this decrease was offset  in part  with incremental compensation cost related to modifications resulting from the stock option exchange program and additional stock option awards granted during 
table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due principally to commencing depreciation of the zz joint venture plant during the quarter ended march  interest income 
interest income increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances due to investment of the proceeds from an equity offering completed in june the yields earned on our cash equivalent investments decreased significantly over fiscal due to market conditions 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  prior to the commissioning of the zz joint venture plant in january  the interest expense for the zz joint venture loan was capitalized 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due to recognizing our joint venture partners noncontrolling interests in the operating losses of the gc joint venture and the zz joint venture during the period 
liquidity and capital resources we are in our development stage and have financed our operations to date through private placements of our common stock in and and two public offerings  one in november and one in june we have used the proceeds of these offerings for the development of our joint ventures in china and to pay other development and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we have entered into a loan agreement with icbc to fund certain of the costs of the zz joint venture 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital available to us 
during the year ended june   cash flows used in operating activities were million 
additionally  we invested million of our cash into the yima joint ventures and repaid million of principal on the zz joint venture loan during the year ended june  we are also funding the working capital and operating losses of the zz joint venture 
loan agreement on march   the zz joint venture entered into a seven year loan agreement and received million of loan proceeds pursuant to the terms of a fixed asset loan contract with the industrial and commercial bank of china  or icbc  to complete the project financing for the zz joint venture 
key terms of the fixed asset loan contract with icbc are as follows term of the loan is seven years from the commencement date march  of the loan  interest is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china  and as of june   the applicable interest rate was and is payable monthly  principal payments of million are due in march and september of each year beginning on september  and ending on march   hai hua is the guarantor of the entire loan  assets of the zz joint venture are pledged as collateral for the loan  covenants include  among other things  prohibiting pre payment without the consent of icbc and permitting icbc to be involved in the review and inspection of the zao zhuang plant  and subject to customary events of default which  should one or more of them occur and be continuing  would permit icbc to declare all amounts owing under the contract to be due and payable immediately 

table of contents as of june   the zz joint venture was in compliance with all covenants and obligations under the fixed asset loan contract 
other during the twelve months ended june   we recognized million of related party revenue for engineering services provided to the yima joint ventures 
we have included the million payment paid to gti in june toward future royalties due to gti for the yima joint ventures project as part of our investment in the yima project 
an additional future royalty payment of approximately million will be due to gti upon the commissioning of the gasifier equipment for the yima project 
see note intangible assets for more information on the royalty payments 
in june  we agreed to pay gti a non refundable payment of million toward future royalties due to gti under the original agreement for the proposed yima joint ventures project 
outlook we expect to continue to have negative cash flows until we can generate sufficient revenues from our licensing and related service projects  as well as from the zz joint venture  the yima joint ventures and other projects which are under development  to cover our general and administrative expenses and other operating costs 
we currently plan to use our available cash for i our general and administrative expenses  ii debt service related to the zz joint venture  iii working capital  iv project  third party licensing and technical development expenses  and v general corporate purposes 
the actual allocation of and the timing of the expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including changes in our strategic relationships  commodity prices and industry conditions  and other factors that we cannot currently predict 
in particular  since mid  the global economy has experienced a significant contraction  with an almost unprecedented lack of availability of business and consumer credit  which has impeded  and could continue to impede  our ability to obtain financing for our projects 
although we are seeing signs of improved economic activity  this decrease and any future decrease in economic activity in china or in other regions of the world in which we may in the future do business could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in a number of other ways 
in addition  the market for commodities such as methanol has been under significant pressure and we are unsure of how much longer this pressure will continue 
as a direct result of these trends  our ability to finance and develop our existing projects  commence any new projects and sell our products could be adversely impacted 
we are pursuing possible u gas licensing opportunities with third parties allowing us to build on our experience at the zz joint venture and our technology and engineering capability 
in april  we executed our first third party technology licensing agreement 
under this agreement  we are providing u gas technology for a commercial scale biomass to biofuels project in the us in addition we and the licensee entered into a separate multi site agreement whereby the licensee has the option to license our biomass gasification technology for five additional commercial scale biomass to biofuels projects within north america 
as part of the license agreement  we are providing the biomass gasification process design package  and may provide some key proprietary gasification system equipment components and technical services 
we intend to place increased focus on development of licensing opportunities for our proprietary u gas technology on a global basis with a focus on india  china  turkey  the us  australia and vietnam  as well as other parts of europe and asia  due to their large low rank coal resources 
in december  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with coalworks limited  an emerging australian energy developer  to develop the first coal gasification and liquefaction plant for coalworks at oaklands  new south wales  australia utilizing our u gas technology 
pursuant to the strategic alliance agreement  we have recently completed a feasibility study for the plant and plan to discuss next steps with coalworks 
we also have recently signed an agreement with another australian company that is in the process of shipping coal to our zao zhuang facility for testing 

table of contents our strategy is to create value by providing technology and equipment in regions where low rank coals and biomass feedstocks can be profitably converted into high value products through our proprietary u gas fluidized bed gasification technology 
we do this through providing a proprietary technology package whereby we license u gas technology rights to third parties  deliver an engineered technology transfer package and provide proprietary equipment components to customers who plan to own and operate projects 
in the us  we believe there may be a significant near term opportunity for us to leverage the capability of u gas to efficiently gasify biomass to make renewable fuels 
today s regulatory environment in the us is favorable for these types of projects because increased environmental concerns are creating a market demand for renewable fuels and companies are under increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint 
we anticipate that we can generate revenues through engineering and technical service fees  as well as licensing fees and royalties on products sold by our licensees that incorporate our proprietary technology without incurring the significant capital costs required to develop a plant 
we also believe that our licensing activities will provide additional insight into project development activities  which may allow us to make selective equity investments in such projects in the future and also the development of integrated  modular product offerings 
we may i integrate our u gas technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering where we may invest in projects either directly or through an investment partner  ii partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our u gas technology package into an integrated modular product offering  iii provide technology to enable coal resources to be integrated together with our u gas technology where the coal resources may be of little value without our u gas conversion technology  or iv acquire or partner with owners of these coal resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the coal resource 
we understand the need to partner in certain markets  and plan to do so with companies that we believe can help us accelerate our business 
our partnering approach in some cases is country specific and in some cases is industry or segment specific 
additionally  where capital and or financing is available  we may acquire an interest in such resources  including existing facilities or coal mines  where we could create value with our u gas technology through securing greater access to feedstock 
we are actively pursuing project partners to invest in our projects development  including a different project scope and end product for the gc joint venture and the yima joint ventures and for the possible expansion of the zz joint venture plant 
our yima project is under construction and yima is the project management leader for the project 
during this first quarter of fiscal  yima has indicated their intent to convert the existing project from methanol production to glycol production 
yima has expressed their belief that the prospect for strong economic performance of the plant can be improved by modifying the backend of the project to make glycol 
this is due to the relatively low margins on methanol today versus the more robust margins that could be achieved from glycol production 
in addition  yima has recently acquired a nearby coal to methanol facility and is looking to diversify and sees glycol as a potentially more profitable alternative 
we have indicated to yima that we would be willing to support this scope change if both parties can agree upon appropriate modifications to the joint venture contracts that can improve our overall risk and return without requiring any additional capital investment from us 
yima s project management team believes that this change can be executed without delaying the original schedule for commercial operation 
we have agreed to work diligently with yima to restructure the agreements as necessary to achieve these goals 
we believe that improving the financial performance and reducing the operating costs of the zz joint venture plant are critical to improving our financial performance and we believe one method to achieve this improvement is through the expansion of the plant to produce products such as glycol and the sale of our excess oxygen capacity to hai hua 
to date  hai hua has been unable to offtake the volume of syngas originally expected for the original plant design and the plant has incurred operating losses 
we do not foresee this situation changing significantly in the near term 
in an effort to improve the return on our investment in this plant  we are evaluating alternative products and partnership structures for a possible expansion of the zz joint venture plant to produce products such as glycol 
additionally  the zz joint venture began to provide oxygen to hai hua in september under a cost sharing arrangement that has increased our byproduct revenues 
we have also entered into an investment cooperation framework agreement with a local zao zhuang area coal mining company which outlines proposed terms for a structure to expand the plant 
we do not expect any additional equity for an expansion would be required from us as we continue to expect to contribute our equity interest toward the expansion with third parties contributing all the additional required equity to expand the plant 
in addition  a provincial level coal company has also expressed an interest in becoming our partner on this expansion 
in february  we received the necessary government approval for the expansion 
this approval  along with the previously received environmental approvals  are the key approvals required for us to commence execution of the expansion and also describe certain terms of the expansion project  including but not limiting to  its use of land  the main additional facilities required and the use of the existing facilities 
the scope of the expansion is still under evaluation 
in addition  our successful commercial scale demonstration at the zao zhuang plant using lignite coal from the inner mongolia region of china was a significant milestone for us and our u gas technology as it demonstrated our ability to efficiently process lignite coal 
as a result of the lignite demonstration  we have seen a large increase in visits to our zao zhuang plant from potential customers and partners 
we intend to continue to leverage our success to date at the zz joint venture in our ongoing business development efforts  including through further visits from senior executives of possible customers and partners  as well as government officials  from china  india  australia  vietnam and the united states 
we believe that there is currently a shift in the coal gasification business toward the use of low quality  and therefore low cost  coals for coal to energy and chemicals projects and we believe that china is a good example of this new direction in coal gasification 
in china  coal prices for high quality coals has risen dramatically over the past few years and the high coal prices have a very negative impact on the margins of its coal gasification projects 
today  china is moving toward even larger coal based projects to fuel the country s energy needs  which includes several large scale coal to methane or sng projects  as compared to previous coal to chemical projects that have been build in china 
due to the current encouragement from the chinese government for these projects  we believe there is potential in china for several of these projects  some of which are in various stages of planning 
in addition  we believe many of these projects will be located in regions where very low cost lignite coals can be made available and are necessary to reduce the production cost of sng and should make these projects more profitable 
as we have found with the tests at our zao zhuang plant  our technology has the unique ability to be efficiently process this lignite and thus we believe it is very desirable for these projects 
as evidence of this  we are in discussions regarding several projects in inner mongolia where the provincial government is making coal resources available to the project owners which adds protection for the project from future coal cost increases  as well as potentially increasing project revenues 
in these types of projects  we believe that we have the opportunity to create more value from the u gas technology than licensing alone could bring us 

table of contents we will limit the development of any further projects until worldwide capital and debt markets improve and we have assurances that acceptable financing is available to complete the project 
however  we will pursue the development of selective projects with strong and credible partners or off takers where we believe equity and debt can be raised or where we believe we can attract a financial partner to participate in the project 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital available to us 
during the year ended june   cash flows used in operating activities were million 
additionally  we invested million of our cash into the yima joint ventures and repaid million of principal on the zz joint venture loan during the year ended june  we may need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing for any new projects that are developed  to support our existing projects and possible expansions thereof and for our corporate general and administrative expenses 
we cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things  i maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels  ii successfully develop our licensing and related service business  iii negotiate and enter into new gasification plant development contracts and licensing agreements  iv expand our operations  v hire and train new employees  or vi respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions which are inherently imprecise and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies due to the significance  subjectivity and judgment involved in determining our estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis utilizing historic experience  anticipated future events or trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the resulting effects of changes in our estimates are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the change in estimate become known 
we believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sales of products  which includes the capacity fee and energy fee earned at the zz joint venture plant  and byproducts are recognized when the following elements are satisfied i there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  ii there is persuasive evidence that an agreement exists  iii delivery has occurred  iv the sales price is fixed or determinable  and v collectability is reasonably assured 
technology licensing revenue is typically received and earned over the course of a project s development 
we may receive upfront licensing fee payments in addition to fees for engineering services that are integral to the initial transfer of our technology to a customer s project 
typically  the majority of a license fee is received once project financing and equipment installation occur 
recognition of upfront licensing fee payments is deferred and recognized as a percentage of completion of the engineering services associated with the initial technology transfer 
further  such revenues are deferred until performance guarantee terms under the licensing agreement are finalized with the licensee 
we recognize revenue from engineering services under the percentage of completion method 
impairment evaluation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  construction in progress  equity method investments and specifically identified intangibles  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used 
we evaluate our operating plants as a whole 
production equipment at each plant is not evaluated for impairment separately  as it is integral to the assumed future operations of the plant 
all construction and development projects are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of potential reduction in fair value 
if it is determined that it is no longer probable that the projects will be completed and all capitalized costs recovered through future operations  the carrying values of the projects would be written down to the recoverable value 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment charge 

table of contents the following summarizes some of the most significant estimates and assumptions used in evaluating if we have an impairment charge 
undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our other earnings forecasts 
the use of this method involves inherent uncertainty 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
fair value 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
we will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment 
we may also consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations  however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments for equity method investments such as our equity investment in the yima joint ventures involve the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that we own directly 
similarly  our estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subjective  and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material 
zz joint venture plant impairment analysis we assessed the zz joint venture s plant assets for impairment as of june  due to its operating at reduced capacity and its operating losses to date 
significant assumptions we made in determination of the projected cash flows for purposes of this impairment analysis included the plant s availability for production of compliant syngas and the plant s coal consumption rate 
variances in these assumptions could result in projected cash flows that do not support the assets carrying values 
for example  if the plant s availability to produce compliant syngas was reduced from to  or if the plant s coal consumption rate does not achieve the forecasted improvement of approximately  the projected cash flows would have been less than the assets carrying values resulting in an impairment of the assets 
the zz joint venture plant operated at limited capacity for a significant part of fiscal and and is expected to continue operating at reduced capacity due to the depressed methanol market 
the reduced capacity at the zz joint venture plant has contributed to the plant s operating losses 
in addition to funding these operating losses  we are funding the working capital and debt service for the zz joint venture 
we are in the process of implementing operational measures  pursuing additional customers and evaluating strategies to reduce the zz joint venture s losses and improve its financial performance including the possible expansion of the plant to produce other products 
if an expansion of the zz joint venture plant were to be developed  we would expect to contribute our interest in the zz joint venture to the project without significant additional cash investment by us 
if we are not successful in improving the zz joint venture s profitability  or if management s estimated cash flow projections for these assets decrease  or if hai hua does not make its required payments  the plant s assets could be impaired 
as of june   we have determined that these assets were not impaired 
accounting for variable interest entities vies and financial statement consolidation criteria the joint ventures which we enter into may be considered vies 
we consolidate all vies where we are the primary beneficiary 
this determination is made at the inception of our involvement with the vie 
we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors and form a conclusion that we  or another interest holder  absorb a majority of the entity s risk for expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s potential for expected residual returns  or both 
we do not consolidate vies where we are not the primary beneficiary 
we account for these unconsolidated vies under the equity method of accounting and include our net investment in investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
our equity interest in the net income or loss from our unconsolidated vies is recorded in non operating income expense on a net basis on our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents we have determined that the zz joint venture is a vie and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary 
in making that determination  we considered  among other items  the change in profit distribution between us and hai hua after years 
the expected negative variability in the fair value of the zz joint venture s net assets was considered to be greater during the first years of the zz joint venture s life  which coincides with our original profit loss allocation  versus the latter years in which our profit loss allocation is reduced to 
in addition  we considered whether the terms of the syngas purchase and sale agreement with hai hua contained a lease 
the factors considered included i our ability to operate and control the plant during the initial years  and ii whether it was more than remote that one or more parties other than hai hua would purchase more than a minor amount considered to be of the plant s output during the term of the syngas purchase and sale agreement 
because we determined that the syngas purchase and sale agreement did not contain a lease  we account for the revenues from this agreement in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for product sales 
off balance sheet arrangements in january  we entered into a month lease agreement  with a month optional renewal  for our corporate offices in houston  texas 
the lease commenced on march  with rental payments of  per month for the first year and escalating thereafter annually 
our obligations under the lease are secured by a letter of credit for  which is payable to the landlord in the event of any uncured default by us under the lease 
the letter of credit remains in place until the third anniversary of the lease 
we have a certificate of deposit pledged as collateral for this letter of credit and pay an annual fee of on this letter of credit 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations at june  were as follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years zz joint venture long term bank loan  including interest operating leases total recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued an amendment to the disclosure requirement related to fair value measurements 
the amendment requires new disclosures related to transfers in and out of levels and and activity in level fair value measurements 
a reporting entity is required to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
additionally  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements in level  a reporting entity must present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than a net number 
the new disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not anticipate that our adoption of this amendment will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets 
this amendment applies to the financial reporting of a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
it eliminates the exceptions for qualifying special purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets 
the provisions of this amendment must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
the requirements in the amendment must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that such requirements may have on our financial statements once adopted

the asc topic for revenue recognition includes identification of a unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be allocated to separate the units of accounting  when applicable 
the new guidance  including expanded disclosures  is applied on a prospective basis beginning on or after june  
table of contents in june  the fasb also issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of vies 
this amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a vie 
the amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a vie 
additionally  the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with vies and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement  as well as how its involvement with vies impacts the enterprise s financial statements 
finally  an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a vie 
this amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier application is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this amendment may have on our financial statements once adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to certain qualitative market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these risks through regular operating and financing activities  and may  in the future  use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to date 
foreign currency risk we conduct operations in china and the functional currency in china is the renminbi yuan 
our financial statements are expressed in us dollars and will be negatively affected if foreign currencies  such as the renminbi yuan  depreciate relative to the us dollar 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by exchange control regulations in china or other countries that restrict our ability to convert into us dollars 
commodity price risk our business plan is to purchase coal and other consumables from suppliers and to sell commodities  such as syngas  methanol and other products 
coal is the largest component of our costs of product sales and in order to mitigate coal price fluctuation risk for future projects  we expect to enter into long term contracts for coal supply or to acquire coal assets 
for the sale of commodities from our projects  fixed price contracts will not be available to us in certain markets  such as china  which will require us to purchase some portion of our coal and other consumable needs  or sell some portion of our production  into spot commodity markets or under short term supply agreements 
hedging transactions may be available to reduce our exposure to these commodity price risks  but availability may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge this exposure at all 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our loan with icbc 
interest under this loan is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china 
as of june   the applicable interest rate was 
we could also be exposed to the risk of rising interest rates through our future borrowing activities 
this is an inherent risk as borrowings mature and are renewed at then current market rates 
the extent of this risk as to our icbc loan  or any future borrowings  is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates 
customer credit risk when our projects progress to commercial production  we will be exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
to manage customer credit risk  we intend to monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
as of june   hai hua  a related party  is our only customer for syngas sales and as such  we are exposed to significant customer credit risk due to this concentration 
our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain hai hua as a customer and secure new customers
