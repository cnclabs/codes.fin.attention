item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  describe certain business risks 
consideration should be given to the risk factors described below as well as those in the safe harbor statement at the beginning of this annual report on form k  in conjunction with reviewing the forward looking statements and other information contained in this annual report on form k 
these risks are not the only risks we face 
our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial in our operations 
economic or industry downturns the current global recession has adversely affected and is likely to continue to adversely affect our business and our industries  as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers 
the volatile domestic and global recessionary climate is having significant negative impacts on our business 
the global recession has resulted in a significant decrease in customer demand throughout nearly all of our markets  including our two largest markets construction and automotive 
the impacts of recent government approved and proposed measures  including various measures intended to provide stimulus to the economy in general or to certain industries  are currently unknown 
overall  operating levels across our businesses have fallen and may remain at depressed levels until economic conditions improve and demand increases 
continued volatility in the united states and worldwide capital and credit markets has impacted and is likely to continue to significantly impact our end markets and result in continued negative impacts on demand  increased credit and collection risks and other adverse effects on our business 
the domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets have experienced and are experiencing significant volatility  disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability 
these have caused diminished availability of credit and other capital in our end markets  including automotive and construction  and for participants in  and the customers of  those markets 
there is continued uncertainty as to when and if the capital and credit markets will improve and the impact this period of volatility will have on our end markets and business in general 
the construction and automotive industries account for a significant portion of our net sales  and reductions in demand from these industries have adversely impacted and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business 
the overall downturn in the economy  the disruption in capital and credit markets  declining real estate values and reduced consumer spending have caused significant reductions in demand from our end markets in general and  in particular  the construction and automotive end markets 
demand in the commercial and residential construction markets has weakened as it has become more difficult for companies and consumers to obtain credit for construction projects and the economic slowdown has caused delays in or cancellations of construction projects 
the domestic auto industry is currently experiencing a very difficult operating environment  which has resulted in and will likely continue to result in lower levels of vehicle production and an associated decrease in demand for products sold to the automotive industry 
many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers have reduced production levels and eliminated manufacturing capacity  through the closure of facilities  extension of temporary shutdowns  reduction in operations and other cost reduction actions 
the difficulties faced by these industries are likely to continue to adversely affect our business 
financial difficulties and bankruptcy filings by customers could have an adverse impact on our business 
many of our customers are experiencing extremely challenging financial conditions 
general motors and chrysler have gone through bankruptcy proceedings and both companies have implemented 
table of contents plans to significantly reduce production capacity and their dealership networks 
certain other customers have filed or are contemplating filing bankruptcy petitions 
these and other customers may be in need of additional capital or credit to continue operations 
the bankruptcies and financial difficulties of certain customers and or failure in their efforts to obtain credit or otherwise improve their overall financial condition could result in numerous changes within the markets we serve  including additional plant closings  decreased production  reduced demand  changes in product mix  unfavorable changes in the prices  terms or conditions we are able to obtain and other changes that may result in decreased purchases from us and otherwise negatively impact our business 
these conditions also increase the risk that our customers may default on their payment obligations to us  particularly customers in hard hit industries such as automotive and construction 
the overall weakness among automotive manufacturers and their suppliers has increased the risk that at least some of our customers  which are suppliers to the automotive industry  could have further financial difficulties 
the same is true of our customers in other industries  including construction  which are also experiencing significant financial weakness 
should the economy or any applicable market not improve  the risk of bankruptcy filings by our customers will continue to increase 
such filings may result not only in a reduction in sales  but also in a loss associated with the potential inability to collect outstanding accounts receivable 
while we take steps intended to mitigate the impact of financial difficulties and potential bankruptcy filings by our customers  these matters could have a negative impact on our business 
raw material pricing and availability the costs of manufacturing our products and the ability to supply our customers could be negatively impacted if we experience interruptions in deliveries of needed raw materials or supplies 
if  for any reason  our supply of flat rolled steel or other key raw materials  such as aluminum and zinc  is curtailed or we are otherwise unable to obtain the quantities we need at competitive prices  our business could suffer and our financial results could be adversely affected 
such interruptions might result from a number of factors  including events such as a shortage of capacity in the supplier base or of the raw materials  energy or the inputs needed to make steel or other supplies  failure of suppliers to fulfill their supply obligations  financial difficulties of suppliers resulting in the closing or idling of supplier facilities  other significant events affecting supplier facilities  significant weather events  those factors listed in the immediately following paragraph or other factors beyond our control 
further  the number of suppliers has decreased in recent years due to industry consolidation and the financial difficulties of certain suppliers  and consolidation may continue 
accordingly  if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted  it may be more difficult to obtain an alternative supply than in the past 
our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in raw material prices 
our principal raw material is flat rolled steel  which we purchase from multiple primary steel producers 
the steel industry as a whole has been cyclical  and at times availability and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control 
these factors include general economic conditions  domestic and worldwide demand  curtailed production from major suppliers due to factors such as the closing or idling of facilities  equipment breakdowns  repairs or catastrophic events  labor costs or problems  competition  import duties  tariffs  energy costs  availability and cost of steel inputs eg ore  scrap  coke and energy  currency exchange rates and other factors described immediately in the preceding paragraph 
this volatility can significantly affect our steel costs 
in an environment of increasing prices for steel and other raw materials  competitive conditions may impact how much of the price increases we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  our financial results could be adversely affected 
also  if steel prices decrease  in general  competitive conditions may impact how quickly we must reduce our prices to our customers and we could be forced to use higher priced raw materials to complete orders for which the selling prices have decreased 
decreasing steel prices may also require us to write down 
table of contents the value of our inventory to reflect current market pricing  as was the case during fiscal these write downs are discussed further in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
inventories our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
we are required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of our customers including  in many cases  short lead times and just in time delivery requirements 
although we typically have customer orders in hand prior to placement of our raw material orders for steel processing  we anticipate and forecast customer demand for all operating segments 
we purchase raw materials on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon orders  customer volume expectations  historic buying practices and market conditions 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in the use of higher priced inventory to fill orders reflecting lower selling prices  if steel prices have significantly decreased 
these events could adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate demand for our products or if our suppliers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages might result in unfilled orders  negatively impacting our customer relationships  and resulting in lost revenues  any of which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results 
suppliers and customers the loss of significant volume from key customers could adversely affect us 
in fiscal  our largest customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales  and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
a significant loss of  or decrease in  business from any of these customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial results if we cannot obtain replacement business 
also  due to consolidation in the industries we serve  including the construction  automotive and retail industries  our sales may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments with respect to  one or more of our top customers 
many of our key industries  such as construction and automotive  are cyclical in nature 
these industries can be impacted by both market demand and raw material supply  particularly steel 
the demand for our products is directly related to  and quickly impacted by  customer demand in our industries  which can change as the result of changes in the general united states or worldwide economy and other factors beyond our control 
adverse changes in demand or pricing can have a negative effect on our business 
significant sales reductions for any of the detroit automakers could have a negative impact on our business 
approximately half of the net sales of our steel processing operating segment and substantially all of the net sales of the automotive body panels operating segment are to automotive related customers 
although we do sell to the domestic operations of foreign automakers  a significant portion of our automotive sales are to ford  general motors  and chrysler the detroit and their suppliers 
the closing or relocation of customer facilities could adversely affect us 
our ability to meet delivery requirements and the overall cost of our products as delivered to a customer facility are important competitive factors 
if customers close or move production facilities further away from our manufacturing facilities which can supply them  it can have an adverse effect on our ability to meet competitive conditions which could result in the loss of sales 
likewise  if customers move production facilities overseas  it can result in the loss of potential sales for the company 
sales conflicts with our customers and or suppliers can adversely impact us 
in some instances  we may compete with one or more customers and or suppliers in pursuing the same business 
such conflicts can strain our relationships with those parties  which can adversely affect our future business with them 

table of contents the closing or idling of steel manufacturing facilities could have a negative impact on us 
as steel makers have reduced their production capacities by closing or idling production lines in light of the current recessionary conditions  the number of facilities from which we can purchase steel  in particular certain specialty steels  has decreased 
accordingly  if delivery from a supplier is disrupted  particularly with respect to certain types of specialty steel  it may be more difficult to obtain an alternate supply than in the past 
also  these closures can have an adverse effect on the supplier s on time delivery performance which can have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our own delivery commitments and may have other adverse effects on our business 
the loss of key supplier relationships could adversely affect us 
over the years  our various manufacturing operations had developed relationships with certain steel and other suppliers which have been beneficial to us by providing more assured delivery and a more favorable all in cost  which includes price and shipping costs 
if those relationships are disrupted  it can have an adverse effect on delivery times and the overall cost of our raw materials  which can have a negative impact on our business 
competition our business is highly competitive  and increased competition could negatively impact our financial results 
generally  the markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive 
competition for most of our products is primarily on the basis of price  product quality and our ability to meet delivery requirements 
the current economic recession has also resulted in significant open capacity which could increase competitive presence 
competition may also increase if suppliers to or customers of our industries begin to more directly compete with our businesses through acquisition or otherwise 
increased competition could cause us to lose market share  increase expenditures  lower our margins or offer additional services at a higher cost to us  which could adversely impact our financial results 
sales by competitors of light guage metal framing products which are not code compliant could adversely affect us 
our metal framing business has been an industry leader in driving code compliance for light gauge metal framing 
if our competitors offer products which are not code compliant and thus are cheaper  and certain customers are willing to purchase such non compliant products  it may be difficult for us to be cost competitive on these sales 
material substitution in certain applications  steel competes with other materials  such as aluminum particularly in the automobile industry  cement and wood particularly in the construction industry  composites  glass and plastic 
prices of all of these materials fluctuate widely and differences between them and steel prices may adversely affect demand for our products and or encourage substitution  which could adversely affect prices and demand for steel products 
the high cost of steel relative to other materials can make material substitution more attractive for certain uses 
freight and energy the availability and cost of freight and energy  such as electricity  natural gas and diesel fuel  is important in the manufacture and transport of our products 
our operating costs increase when energy costs rise 
during periods of increasing freight and energy costs  we might not be able to fully recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products 
our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to pass all of the increases on to our customers or if we are unable to obtain the necessary freight and energy 
also  increasing energy costs could put a strain on the transportation of materials and products if it forces certain transporters to close 

table of contents information systems we are subject to information system security risks and systems integration issues that could disrupt our internal operations 
we are dependent upon information technology for the distribution of information internally and also to our customers and suppliers 
this information technology is subject to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including but not limited to computer viruses  security breaches and defects in design 
there also could be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly  or are not properly integrated into operations 
we recently implemented a new software based enterprise resource planning system 
various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information system and network disruptions  but a system failure could negatively impact our operations and financial results 
business disruptions disruptions to our business or the business of our customers or suppliers  could adversely impact our operations and financial results 
business disruptions  including increased costs for or interruptions in the supply of energy or raw materials  resulting from shortages of supply or transportation  from severe weather events such as hurricanes  floods and blizzards  from casualty events such as explosions  fires or material equipment breakdown  from acts of terrorism  from pandemic disease  from labor disruptions or from other events such as required maintenance shutdowns could cause interruptions to our businesses as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers 
while we maintain insurance coverage that can offset some losses relating to certain types of these events  losses from business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results and we can be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by insurance or cause some other adverse impact to the us 
foreign economic  political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international financial results 
although the substantial majority of our business activity takes place in the united states  we derive a portion of our revenues and earnings from operations in foreign countries  and are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we have wholly owned facilities in austria  canada  the czech republic and portugal and joint venture facilities in china  france  india  mexico  spain and the united kingdom 
our mid rise construction business is also becoming more active in pursuing foreign business 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include the potential for adverse changes in the local political climate  in diplomatic relations between foreign countries and the united states or in government policies  laws or regulations  terrorist activity that may cause social disruption  logistical and communications challenges  costs of complying with a variety of laws and regulations  difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations  deterioration of foreign economic conditions  currency rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  differing local business practices and cultural considerations  restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply  changes in duties or taxes  and potential issues related to matters covered by the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws 
we believe that our business activities outside of the united states involve a higher degree of risk than our domestic activities 
the global recession and the volatility of worldwide capital and credit markets have impacted and will likely continue to significantly impact our foreign customers and markets 
this has decreased demand in our foreign operations and is having significant negative impacts on our business 
see  in general  the discussion under economic or industry downturns above 
joint ventures a change in the relationship between the members of any of our joint ventures may have an adverse effect on that joint venture 
worthington has been successful in the development and operation of various joint ventures  and equity in net income from our joint ventures  particularly wave  has been important to our 
table of contents financial results 
we believe an important element in the success of any joint venture is a solid relationship between the members of that joint venture 
if there is a change in ownership  a change of control  a change in management or another event with respect to a member that adversely impacts the relationship between the members  it may adversely impact the joint venture 
acquisitions we may not be able to consummate  manage and integrate future acquisitions successfully 
some of our growth has been through acquisitions 
we continue to seek additional businesses to acquire in the future 
there are no assurances  however  that any acquisition opportunities will arise or  if they do  that they will be consummated  or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when required 
in addition  acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations  that business judgments concerning the value  strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect  that the acquired businesses may not be integrated successfully and that the acquisitions may strain our management resources 
accounting tax estimates we are required to make accounting and tax related estimates and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is dependent on future events  or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
the estimates and the assumptions having the greatest amount of uncertainty  subjectivity and complexity are related to our accounting for bad debts  returns and allowances  inventory  self insurance reserves  derivatives  stock based compensation  deferred income taxes and asset impairments 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
claims and insurance adverse claims experience  to the extent not covered by insurance  may have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we self insure a significant portion of our potential liability for workers compensation  product liability  general liability  property  automobile liability and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce risk  we purchase insurance from highly rated  licensed insurance carriers that covers most claims in excess of the deductible or retained amounts 
we maintain reserves for the estimated cost to resolve open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
the occurrence of significant claims  our failure to adequately reserve for such claims  a significant cost increase to maintain our insurance or the failure of our insurance provider to perform could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
principal shareholder our principal shareholder may have the ability to exert significant influence in matters requiring a shareholder vote and could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of worthington industries 
pursuant to our charter documents  certain matters such as those in which a person would attempt to acquire or take control of the company  must be approved by the vote of the holders of common shares representing at least of worthington industries outstanding voting power 
approximately of our outstanding common shares are beneficially owned by john p 
mcconnell  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
as a result of his beneficial ownership  mr 
mcconnell may have the ability to exert significant influence in these matters and other proposals upon which our shareholders vote 

table of contents credit ratings rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which could make it more difficult for us to raise capital and could increase our financing costs 
any downgrade in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
the rate on some of our credit facilities is tied to our credit rating 
any downgrade would likely result in an increase in the current cost of our revolving credit facility 
difficult financial markets should we be required to raise capital in the current financing environment  potential outcomes might include higher borrowing costs  less available capital  more stringent terms and tighter covenants  or in extreme conditions  an inability to raise capital 
although we currently have significant borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities  should those facilities become unavailable due to covenant or other defaults  or should we otherwise be required to raise capital outside existing facilities  given the current uncertainty in the financial markets  our ability to access capital and the terms under which we do so may change 
any adverse change in our access to capital or the terms of our borrowings  including increased costs  would have a negative impact on us 
environmental  health and safety we may incur additional costs related to environmental and health and safety matters 
our operations and facilities are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety 
failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws and regulations or with the permits required for our operations could result in increased costs and capital expenditures and potentially fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations 
over time  we and other predecessor operators of our facilities have generated  used  handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes 
environmental liabilities could exist  including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off site locations where materials from our operations were disposed of or at facilities we have divested  which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits and cash flow 
we may be held strictly liable for the contamination of these sites  and the amount of that liability could be material 
due to our stringent commitment toward safety  it is probable that we may incur costs which exceed compliance in many areas 
under the joint and several liability principle of certain environmental laws  we may be held liable for all remediation costs at a particular site  even with respect to contamination for which we are not responsible 
changes in environmental laws  regulations or enforcement policies  including without limitation new or more stringent regulations affecting greenhouse gas emissions  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
legislation and regulation certain proposed legislation and regulations can have an adverse impact on the economy in general and in our markets specifically  which may adversely affect our business 
for example  legislation and regulations proposing increases in taxation on or heightened regulation of carbon emissions may result in higher prices for steel  higher prices for utilities required to run our facilities  higher fuel costs for us and our shippers and other adverse impacts 
to the extent this or other new legislation or regulation increases our costs  we may not be able to fully pass these costs on to our customers without a resulting decline in sales and adverse impact to our profits 
likewise  to the extent new legislation or regulation would have an adverse effect on the economy  our markets or the ability of domestic businesses to compete against foreign operations  it could also have an adverse impact on us 

table of contents impairment charges continued or enhanced weakness in the economy  our markets or our results of operations could result in future asset impairments  which would reduce our reported earnings and net worth 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable 
when a potential impairment is indicated  accounting standards require a charge to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements if the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets exceeds the fair value of that asset or group of assets 
the loss recognized would be the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets
