item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
business overview we design  develop  manufacture and market proprietary  high voltage  analog integrated circuits ics for use in electronic power supplies  also known as switched mode power supplies 
our ics are used principally in ac dc power supplies in a wide variety of end products  primarily in the consumer  communications  computer and industrial electronics markets 
for example  our ics are commonly used in such end products as mobile phone chargers  desktop computers  home entertainment equipment  appliances  utility meters and led light fixtures 
we believe that our products enable power supplies superior to those designed with alternative technologies 
we differentiate our ics through innovation aimed at helping our customers meet the desired performance specifications for their power supplies while minimizing complexity  component count  time to market and overall system cost 
we invest significant resources in research and development in an effort to achieve this differentiation 
while the size of the power supply market fluctuates with changes in macroeconomic conditions  such as the current economic downturn  the market has generally exhibited only a modest growth rate over time  as growth in the unit volumes of power supplies has largely been offset by reductions in the average selling price of components in this market 
therefore  the growth rate of our revenues  income and cash flow depends primarily on our penetration of the power supply market  as well as our success in expanding the addressable market by introducing new products that address a wider range of applications 
our growth strategy includes the following elements increase the penetration of our ics in the low power ac dc power supply market 
the vast majority of our revenues come from power supply applications requiring watts of output or less 
we continue to introduce more advanced products that make our ic based solutions more attractive in this market 
we have also increased the size of our sales and field engineering staff considerably over the past several years  and we continue to expand our offerings of technical documentation and design support tools and services in order to help customers use our ics 
these tools and services include our pi expert design software  which we offer free of charge  and our transformer sample service 
capitalize on the growing demand for more energy efficient electronic products and lighting technologies 
we believe that energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important design criterion for power supplies due largely to the emergence of standards and specifications that encourage  and in some cases mandate  the design of more energy efficient electronic products 
while power supplies built with competing technologies are often unable to meet these standards cost effectively  power supplies incorporating our ics are generally able to comply with all known efficiency specifications currently in effect 
additionally  technological advances combined with concerns about the inefficiency of traditional incandescent lighting are resulting in the adoption of alternative lighting technologies such as light emitting diodes leds 
we believe this presents a significant opportunity for us because our ics are used in power supply circuitry for high voltage  or offline  led lighting applications 
expand our addressable market to include high power applications 
we believe we have developed new technologies and products that enable us to bring the benefits of highly integrated power supplies 
table of contents to applications requiring more than watts of output 
these include such applications as main power supplies for flat panel tvs and pcs  as well as power supplies for led streetlights  game consoles  and notebook computers 
our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuations 
external factors such as global economic conditions and supply chain dynamics can cause our operating results to be volatile 
for example  like many semiconductor companies  we experienced a sharp decrease in demand for our products beginning in the fourth quarter of as a result of the global economic downturn  but have experienced a sharp recovery in demand since the first quarter of  reflecting an improvement in business conditions industry wide as well as increased penetration of our products into our addressable markets 
also  our business is normally characterized by short term orders and short customer lead times  and a high percentage of our revenues may come from turns business  or orders booked and shipped within the same quarter 
customers typically can cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty 
we plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
our net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the growth of revenues in each of these years primarily reflects the increased penetration of our products into our addressable markets 
our top ten customers  including distributors that resell to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers  accounted for  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
our top two customers  both distributors of our products  collectively accounted for approximately of our net revenues for in and  one customer  a distributor of our products accounted for and of net revenues  respectively 
in  and  international sales comprised  and  respectively  of our net revenues 
because our industry is intensely price sensitive  our gross margin gross profit divided by net revenues is subject to change based on the relative pricing of solutions that compete with ours 
variations in product and customer mix can also cause our gross margin to fluctuate 
also  because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon wafers from foundries located in japan  our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
all else being equal  a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen would eventually result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately one percentage point 
also  although our wafer fabrication and assembly operations are outsourced  as are most of our test operations  a portion of our production costs are fixed in nature 
as such  our unit costs and gross profit margin are impacted by the volume of units we produce 
our gross profit  defined as net revenues less cost of revenues  was million  or of net revenues  in  compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in the reduction in our gross margin in was driven by several factors the weakening of the us dollar compared with the japanese yen  which increases the cost of our silicon wafers  increased sales of recently introduced products  which tend to have lower gross margin than earlier generation products  and the expiration of our royalty agreement with panasonic in mid  which eliminated a small but high margin revenue stream 
while we cannot predict the future direction of our gross margin because many of the factors influencing it are outside of our control  we are working to increase our gross margin through a combination of product cost reductions and the development of new products and technologies aimed at increasing the value of our ics to customers 
total operating expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses in compared with was driven primarily by reduced stock based compensation expenses  which totaled million in compared with million in the higher amount in was the result of a tender offer we conducted at the end of to repurchase outstanding out of the money stock options  the tender offer resulted in the recognition of million of stock based compensation expenses in that would otherwise have been recognized over the remaining 
table of contents vesting periods of the tendered options of up to four years 
in we also incurred a charge of approximately million related to impairment of intangible assets 
while our operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future  over time our aim is to increase them at a rate lower than the growth rate of our revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those listed below 
we base our estimates on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  stock based compensation  estimating sales returns and allowances  estimating distributor pricing credits  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating write downs for excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  and goodwill and intangible assets 
our critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a brief description of these critical accounting policies is set forth below 
for more information regarding our accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenues consist of sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  merchant power supply manufacturers and distributors 
shipping terms to international oem customers and merchant power supply manufacturers from our facility in california are delivered at frontier daf 
as such  title to the product passes to the customer and revenue is recognized when the shipment reaches the destination country 
shipping terms to international oems and merchant power supply manufacturers on shipments from our facility outside of the united states are ex works exw  meaning that title to the product transfers to the customer upon shipment from our foreign warehouse 
shipments to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers in the americas are free on board fob point of origin meaning that revenue is recognized upon shipment  when the title is passed to the customer 
we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition accounting standard codification asc asc and all related appropriate guidance 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to have occurred 
table of contents when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we consider the price to be fixed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks we perform as well as the customer s payment history 
we make sales to distributors and retail partners and recognize revenue based on a sell through method 
sales to distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return on our products held by the distributors 
as a result of these rights  we defer the recognition of revenue and the costs of revenues derived from sales to distributors until such distributors resell our products to our customers 
we determine the amount to defer based on the level of actual inventory on hand at our distributors as well as inventory in transit to our distributors 
fluctuations in deferred income on sales to distributors coincide with an increase or decrease in revenue shipments to our distributors  in addition  deferred income levels are also impacted by the speed at which our distributors sell our products to their end customers 
the gross profit that is deferred as a result of this policy is reflected as deferred income on sales to distributors in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the total deferred revenue as of december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the total deferred cost as of december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation we apply the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment asc 
under the provisions of asc  we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation in financial statements over the requisite service period of the individual grants  which generally equals a four year vesting period 
we use estimates of volatility  term  risk free interest rate  dividend yield and forfeitures in determining the fair value of these awards 
changes in these estimates could result in changes to our compensation charges 
estimating sales returns and allowances net revenues consist primarily of product revenues reduced by estimated sales returns and allowances 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze  both when we initially establish the reserve and then each quarter when we review the adequacy of the reserve  the following factors historical returns  current economic trends  levels of inventories of our products held by our distributors  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
this reserve represents a reserve of the gross profit on estimated future returns and is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the reserve are recorded as a reduction to net revenues equal to the expected customer credit memo  and a corresponding credit is made to cost of revenues equal to the estimated cost of the product to be returned 
the net difference  or gross margin  is recorded as an addition to the reserve 
because the reserve for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to future customer demand and level of acceptance of our products  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our future net revenues and cost of revenues could be adversely affected 
estimating distributor pricing credits historically  between one half and two thirds of our total sales have been made to distributors 
frequently  distributors need a cost lower than our standard sales price in order to win business 
after the distributor ships product to its customer  the distributor submits a ship and debit claim to us in order to adjust its cost from the standard price to the approved lower price 
after verification by us  a credit memo is issued to the distributor to adjust the sell in price from the standard distribution price to the pre approved lower price 
we maintain a reserve for these credits that appears as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
any increase in the reserve results in a corresponding reduction in our net revenues 
to establish the adequacy of our reserves  we analyze historical ship and debit amounts and levels of inventory in the distributor channels 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 

table of contents if we reduce our distribution list prices  we give our distributors protection against these price declines in the form of credits on products they hold in inventory 
these credits are referred to as price protection 
since we do not recognize revenue until the distributor sells the product to its customers  we generally do not need to provide reserves for price protection 
however  in rare instances we must consider price protection in the analysis of reserve requirements  as there may be a timing gap between a price decline and the issuance of price protection credits 
if a price protection reserve is required  we will maintain a reserve for these credits that appears as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
any increase in the reserve results in a corresponding reduction in our net revenues 
we analyze distribution price declines and levels of inventory in the distributor channels in determining the reserve levels required 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
estimating allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for losses we may incur as a result of our customers inability to make required payments 
any increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts results in a corresponding increase in our general and administrative expenses 
in establishing this allowance  and in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  or if we otherwise underestimate the losses we incur as a result of our customers inability to pay us  we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could in turn adversely affect our operating results 
estimating write downs for excess and obsolete inventory when evaluating the adequacy of our valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory  we identify excess and obsolete products and also analyze historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends  and historical write offs 
this write down is reflected as a reduction to inventory in the consolidated balance sheets  and an increase in cost of revenues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  we may be required to take additional write downs  which could adversely impact our cost of revenues and operating results 
income taxes income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carry forwards that are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes asc 
under the provisions of asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  utilizing the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets to the amount that we estimate will more likely than not be realized based on available evidence and management s judgment 
we limit the deferred tax assets recognized related to certain of our officers compensation to amounts that we estimate will be deductible in future periods based upon internal revenue code section m 
in the event that we determine  based on available evidence and management judgment  that all or part of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future  we would record a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents on february   california enacted budget legislation that allows certain corporate taxpayers to elect to use a single sales factor to apportion income for taxable years beginning on or after january  this legislation is expected to enable us to significantly reduce our apportionment to california starting in this change in law resulted in additional tax provision of million for the year ended december  during the quarter ended march   the company concluded there is a need for a valuation allowance on a portion of its california deferred tax assets primarily due to recent california budget legislation 
as of december   the company also maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of its deferred tax assets relating primarily to tax credits in certain non us jurisdictions 
goodwill and intangible asset in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets asc  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or as other indicators of impairment emerge 
the provisions of asc require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the implied fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment adjustment is required 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value  step two will be completed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any exists 
if the carrying value of our single reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference  but not in excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter  and concluded that no impairment existed as of december  asc also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc 
we review long lived assets  such as acquired intangibles and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  we recognize an impairment charge by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we would present assets to be disposed of separately in the balance sheet or footnote disclosure and would report the assets at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and would no longer depreciate the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale

our operating expenses and cost of revenues in include non cash  stock based compensation expenses recognized under asc these non cash expenses were significantly higher in as compared to due primarily to our completion of a tender offer in december  through which we repurchased million employee stock options 
the tender offer resulted in the recognition of million of incremental stock based compensation expenses in that would otherwise have been recognized over the remaining vesting periods of the tendered options of up to four years 
total stock based compensation expense in was million  compared with million in  reflecting these accelerated expenses 
the table below compares stock based compensation expenses for and in thousands 
stock based compensation expense included in year ended december  change cost of revenues research development expense sales marketing expense general administrative expense total net revenues 
net revenues consist of revenues from product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances  plus license fees and royalties 
net revenues increased in compared with as a result of growth in the volume of units sold into the consumer  communications and industrial end markets  including applications such as appliances  home entertainment equipment  mobile phone chargers  led lights and utility 
table of contents meters 
the increase in net revenue did not fully correspond to the increase in unit volume because the product mix included a larger percentage of recently introduced products  which tend to have a lower average sales price than earlier generation products 
we believe the growth in our net revenues reflects increased penetration of our ics in the ac dc power supply market and  to a lesser extent  increased demand for consumer appliances and entertainment equipment in china as a result of government subsidies of consumer purchases 
our net revenue mix by product family and by the end markets served in and were as follows product family year ended december  tinyswitch linkswitch topswitch other end market year ended december  consumer communications industrial electronics computer prior to  our revenue mix by end market included a category called other  primarily representing revenues from low volume designs for which the end market was not readily identifiable 
beginning in  we eliminated the other category  electing instead to allocate these revenues to the four primary end markets using management s estimate of the approximate end market distribution for these revenues 
we believe this method provides a more accurate view of our revenue mix by end market 
for the sake of comparability with the prior period  we revised our revenue mix data for to reflect the new format  as shown above 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total net revenues were reclassified from other to our four primary end market categories 
also  beginning in  we reclassified revenues related to certain smart phone devices from the computer end market category to the communications category  the revenue mix data provided above for has also been revised to reflect this reclassification 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our net revenues were reclassified from computer revenues to communications revenues 
sales to customers outside of the americas were million in compared to million in  representing approximately and of net revenues  respectively 
although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured by our customers in asia 
as a result  sales to this region were and of our net revenues for and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues 
distributors accounted for of our net product sales for the twelve months ended december   while of revenues were from direct sales to end customers 
these percentages did not change significantly compared with in  two distributors  avnet and atm electronic corporation  accounted for approximately and of our net revenues  respectively 
in  avnet accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
no other customers accounted or more of net revenues during these years 
customer demand for our products can change quickly and unexpectedly 
our customers perceive that our products are readily available and typically order only for their short term needs 
our revenue levels are highly dependent on the amount of new orders that we receive for which product can be delivered by us within the same period 
orders that are booked and shipped within the same period are called turns business 
because of the uncertainty of customer demand  and the short lead time environment and proportionally high turns business  it is difficult to predict future levels of revenues and profitability 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of wafers from our contracted foundries  the assembly  packaging and testing of our products by sub contractors  product testing performed in our own facility  and overhead associated with the management of our supply chain 
gross margin is gross profit divided by net revenues 
the table below compares gross profit for the twelve months ended december  and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues gross profit gross margin the decrease in our gross margin in compared to was driven by a variety of factors  including increased sales of recently introduced products  which tend to have a lower gross margin than earlier generation products  the stronger japanese yen compared to the us dollar  and lower royalty revenues reflecting the expiration of our royalty agreement with panasonic in june these effects were partially offset by a benefit of million recognized from the sale of previously reserved inventory  and lower stock based compensation expense in compared to stock based compensation expense was million in compared to million in research and development expenses 
research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including stock based compensation and expensed material and facility costs associated with the development of new processes and new products 
we also record r d expenses for prototype wafers related to new products until such products are released to production 
the table below compares r d expenses for the twelve months ended december  and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues r d expenses r d expenses as a of net revenue r d expenses were down in compared with  due primarily to a decline in stock based compensation expenses  which was partially offset by increased product and technology development expenses 
r d related stock based compensation expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the reduction in stock based compensation expenses was primarily the result of the tender offer conducted in to repurchase employee stock options  as well as reduced expenses associated with our employee stock purchase plan 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including stock based compensation  commissions to sales representatives  and facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
the table below compares sales and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses as a of net revenue the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared with was driven primarily by lower stock based compensation expenses reflecting the impact of the tender offer  as well as reduced 
table of contents expenses associated with our employee stock purchase plan 
stock based compensation expenses for the year ended december  were million compared with million in the decrease also reflects general expense reduction efforts undertaken in response to the economic downturn 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative  or g a  expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including stock based compensation expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  as well as consulting  professional services  legal and auditing expenses 
the table below compares g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues g a expenses g a expenses as a of net revenue the decrease in g a expenses for the year ended december  compared with the same period in was primarily the result of lower stock based compensation expenses reflecting the impact of the tender offer  as well as reduced expenses associated with our employee stock purchase plan 
stock based compensation expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease was partially offset by higher legal expenses related to patent litigation  patent litigation expenses totaled million in compared with million in impairment of intangibles 
in the fourth quarter of we concluded that intangible assets related to a certain patent  licensed technology and customer relationships were no longer useful in our manufacturing and sales processes and were therefore impaired 
as a result  we recognized a non cash charge of million in the quarter ended december  total other income 
total other income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and investments 
other income  net totaled million in compared with million in the decrease was due partially to lower interest income on our cash and investments  reflecting lower interest rates available during the year 
the decrease in was also due to an insurance reimbursement of million received in for legal fees related to litigation filed against us and certain of our directors and officers  in connection with an investigation relating to historical stock option grants 
because the settlement is final  we do not expect any future insurance reimbursement 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the table below compares the provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december  and dollars in millions year ended december  income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of for the twelve months ended december  due primarily to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings  partially offset by the establishment of a partial valuation allowance on our california deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate in was higher than the statutory rate of primarily due to an increase in the relative amount of non deductible stock based compensation charges  as well as lower profitability in our foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us rate 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits in

net revenues increased by in compared to the increase was driven by increased sales of our products across a wide range of applications in each of our four major end market categories  including mobile phone chargers  led lighting applications  cordless phones  consumer appliances and various other applications 
the increase in net revenues was driven largely by sales of our linkswitch products  which are generally utilized in very low power applications 
the growth in linkswitch sales was partially offset by lower sales of our tinyswitch products  primarily reflecting the loss of a major end customer in the communications market in our net revenue mix by product family and by the end markets served in and are as follows year ended december  product family tinyswitch topswitch linkswitch dpa switch year ended december  end market consumer communications computer industrial electronics prior to  our revenue mix by end market included a category called other  primarily representing revenues from low volume designs for which the end market was not readily identifiable

the table below compares r d expenses for the twelve months ended december  and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues r d expenses r d expenses as a of net revenue the increase in r d expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expenses of million recognized in of this amount  million was in conjunction with the tender offer described above 
r d expenses also increased as a result of our acquisition of potentia semiconductor in december  as most of potentia s employees joined our company in research and development functions 
sales and marketing expenses

table of contents the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of million recognized in of this amount  million was in conjunction with the tender offer described above 
also contributing to the increase was higher headcount related expenses such as salaries and payroll taxes  reflecting growth in our global sales force 
general and administrative expenses 
the table below compares g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues g a expenses g a expenses as a of net revenue the increase in g a expenses in was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of million recognized in the fourth quarter of of this amount  million was in conjunction with the tender offer described above 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in professional services expenses  which were elevated in due to the restatement of our historical financial statements  which was completed during that year 
impairment of intangibles 
in the quarter ended december   we recognized a non cash charge of million reflecting the impairment of certain intangible assets 
as a result of our ongoing monitoring of asset impairment we performed an analysis of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of  and concluded we had an impairment of intangible assets related to a certain patent  licensed technology and customer relationships 
we determined that these intangible assets were no longer useful in our manufacturing and sales processes and they were written off completely 
there was no such impairment in the year ended december  total other income 
other income  net totaled million in compared with million in the decrease was due partially to a decrease in interest income on our cash and investment balances  reflecting generally lower interest rates available during the year on cash and short term investments  and a reduction in our overall cash and short term investment balances as a result of our stock buyback plan 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million for compared to a provision of million for our effective tax rate for was approximately  compared to approximately in the increase in our effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due an increase in the relative amount of non deductible stock based compensation charges and lower profitability in our foreign jurisdictions which is taxed at rates lower than the us rate 
the increase was partially offset by an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments at december  compared to million at december  including million of restricted cash in and  and million at december  including million of restricted cash in 
we entered into a security agreement with the union bank of california  whereby we agreed to maintain million in an interest bearing certificate of deposit cd with the bank 
the purpose of this agreement was to secure commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit up to the deposit amount 
as of december   our cd was for million  per our agreement with the bank

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we consider cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater than three months but not longer than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as short term investments 
investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as long term investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage our interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  or for any other purpose 
we invest in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to facilitate portfolio liquidity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
at december  and we held primarily cash equivalents and short term and long term investments with fixed interest rates 

table of contents the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at december  and carrying value approximates fair market value at december  and in thousands  except weighted average interest rates

our investment securities are subject to market interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
to minimize market risk  most of our investments subject to market risk mature in less than one year  and therefore if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by from interest rates as of december  and  the increase or decrease in the fair market value of our portfolio on these dates would not have been material 
we monitor our investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of our investments exceeds its fair value  and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary  we will reduce the carrying value to its current fair value 
as of december  none of our investments were impaired 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are in asia and western europe and involve a contract with one of our suppliers oki 
currently  we do not employ a foreign currency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  however  the contract prices to purchase wafers from oki are denominated in japanese yen and the agreement allows for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
the purchase price is fixed at a base rate and allows for some sharing of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations from the base rate 
one of our other major suppliers  epson  contracts prices to purchase wafers in us dollars however  the agreement with epson also allows for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
each year  our management and epson agree to a fixed exchange rate 
the fluctuation from this annual exchange rate is shared equally between both parties 
nevertheless  changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen could subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations
