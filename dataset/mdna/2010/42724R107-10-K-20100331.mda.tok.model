local economic climate the economy in the company s service area is based primarily on agriculture  tourism  light industry  oil and retail trade 
services supporting these industries have also developed in the areas of medical  financial and educational services 
the population of san luis obispo county  the city of santa maria in northern santa barbara county  and the city of santa barbara totaled approximately   and  respectively  according to the most recent economic data provided by the us census bureau 
the moderate climate allows a year round growing season in the local economy s agricultural sector 
vineyards and cattle ranches also contribute largely to the local economy 
the central coast s leading agricultural industry is the production of wine grapes and production of premium quality wines 
vineyards in production have grown significantly over the past several years throughout the company s service area 
access to numerous recreational activities and destinations including lakes  mountains and beaches  provide a relatively stable tourist industry from many areas including the los angeles orange county basin  the san francisco bay area and the san joaquin valley 
the economy in the company s primary markets of san luis obispo and santa barbara counties has not been immune to the current downturn in national and state economic conditions 
weakened economic conditions have resulted in  among other things  increased unemployment  increased vacancy rates  and lower occupancy rates in the hospitality industry within the company s primary markets 
however  the abundant tourism that has developed over the past decade in our market area  especially in the wine industry and coastal communities  has provided some support for our local economy in previous economic downturns and has to some degree provided some support for the local economy in the current economic environment 
proved to be a challenging year not only on the national level  but within the state of california and more specifically our primary market area 
as the us housing market continued to wane throughout and economic growth remained weak  the ability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations to the financial sector has languished 
these among other factors placed severe stress on the us financial system  leading to a crisis of confidence in the financial sector in the first half of  further downturn in economic growth and unprecedented volatility in the us equity and credit markets 
as mentioned  our primary market area has historically witnessed a more stable level of economic activity  however we believe these more macro level concerns have started to become more evident within our market area 
recent indications show the unemployment rate within california to be approximately 
within the company s primary market area  recent indications show the unemployment rate within san luis obispo and santa barbara major metropolitan areas to be approximately and  respectively 
additionally  according to a recent publication by smith travel research in regard to hotel occupancy rates comparing may to may  there was a decline in occupancy of  and for paso robles san luis obispo  santa barbara santa maria and the state of california  respectively 
housing prices have fallen significantly in california and within the bank s market area from the highs seen during and recent information provided by dataquick information systems indicates that housing prices in san luis obispo and santa barbara counties have declined in excess of from the highs seen in and however  the company s market area has seen increases in home sales over the last year  with san luis obispo and santa barbara counties showing sales increases of approximately and  respectively for when compared to that reported for increased sales can be attributed in part to sales of distressed assets and the work through of any additional supply added to the market in recent years during the economic downturn 
although the level of sales in the company s market area has increased on a year over year basis  recent information provided by dataquick indicates home prices declined in compared to that reported for december prices in some of the largest cities in our market area such as san luis obispo  paso robles  santa barbara  and santa maria have shown year over year declines of approximately   and  respectively as of december it should be noted that although changes in local median home prices typically indicate home price appreciation and depreciation  price changes may also reflect shifts in the composition of housing market activity 
therefore  some of the variations in median home prices as of december may be impacted by compositional changes in housing demand 
although prices in the company s market area remain well below the highs witnessed in and  a significant lack of oversupply in the company s market relative to other areas of california  desirable climate  and close proximity to popular tourist destinations  for both san luis obispo and santa barbara counties have resulted in lower percentage declines in prices for the local real estate market  relative to other areas of california 
commercial real estate prices in the company s primary markets have also come under some pressure in the current economic downturn  although not to the extent witnessed in some other areas of california 
the most current data available to the company indicates vacancy rates in the retail  office and manufacturing sectors of the company s primary market area to be  and  respectively as of the fourth quarter of this compares to vacancy rates of  and for the same respective categories in management acknowledges that as economic conditions continue to wane on state and national levels and as the level of unemployment continues to rise  conditions within our primary market may be negatively impacted above and beyond what the company has seen thus far 
additional job losses and any prolonged decline in economic activity will no doubt impact the borrowers to whom the bank has extended credit  which may further impact our operating results and financial condition 
competition banking and the financial services business in california generally  and in the company s service area specifically  is highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers and the appearance of new banking organizations 
in order to compete with other financial institutions in its service area  the bank relies principally upon local advertising programs  direct personal contact by officers  directors  employees  and shareholders  and specialized services such as courier pick up and delivery of non cash banking items 
the bank emphasizes to customers the advantages of dealing with a locally owned and community oriented institution 
the bank also seeks to provide special services and programs for individuals in its primary service area who are employed in the agricultural  professional and business fields  such as loans for equipment  furniture  tools of the trade or expansion of practices or businesses 
larger banks may have a competitive advantage because of higher lending limits and major advertising and marketing campaigns 
they also perform services  such as trust services  international banking  discount brokerage and insurance services that the bank is not authorized or prepared to offer currently 
the bank has made arrangements with correspondent banks and with others to provide such services for its customers 
for borrowers requiring loans in excess of the bank s legal lending limits  the bank has offered  and intends to offer in the future  such loans on a participating basis with correspondent banks and with other independent banks  retaining the portion of such loans which is within its lending limit 
commercial banks compete with savings and loan associations  credit unions  other financial institutions  securities brokerage firms  and other entities for funds 
for instance  yields on corporate and government debt securities and other commercial paper affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits 
the recent stresses placed on the us financial system have had a direct impact on the levels of liquidity at many financial institutions  which in turn has made the competition for deposits more challenging in the current economic environment 
commercial banks also compete for loans with savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  mortgage companies  and other lending institutions 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes involving frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services that have further increased competition 
there can also be no assurance that these technological improvements  if made  will increase the company s operational efficiency or that the company will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
effect of government policies and recent legislation banking is a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received by the company on loans extended to its customers and securities held in its investment portfolio comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including inflation  recession and unemployment 
the commercial banking business is not only affected by general economic conditions but is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation  combating recession and providing liquidity by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact on the company of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory and other professional agencies

supervision and regulation regulatory order and written agreement the bank stipulated to the issuance of a consent order the order  effective march   with the fdic  its principal federal banking regulator  and the california department of financial institutions dfi which requires the bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness 
the bank s stipulation to the issuance by the fdic and the dfi of the order resulted from certain findings in a report of examination resulting from an examination of the bank conducted in september based upon financial and lending data measured as of june  in entering into the stipulation to entry of the order  the bank did not concede the findings or admit to any of the assertions in the report of examination roe 
under the order  the bank is required to take certain measures as more fully discussed below

the bank intends to fully comply with the order and will continue to take all steps necessary to achieve such compliance 
among the corrective actions required are for the bank to develop and adopt a plan to maintain the minimum capital requirements for a well capitalized bank  and to reach and maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least and a total risked based capital ratio of at the bank level beginning days from the issuance of the order 
based on the company s recently completed capital raise  on a pro forma basis as of december  and assuming the full million of preferred stock is issued and an initial contribution of million to the bank from the company  the bank s leverage ratio and total risk based capital ratio would be and  respectively

a consultant has been retained to complete the required management study  and the bank intends to comply with the order s timelines for completion of such study and implementation by the board of a plan to address the findings of such study 
as part of the capital raise  the company and bank have agreed to seek regulatory approval to add as a director of both the bank and company one of the principals of the investor in the transaction that proposes to own approximately of the outstanding voting shares of the company 
appropriate applications for such approval were submitted on march  the addition of a director to the company s board of directors will require an amendment to the company s bylaws to increase the range of the size of the board 
such an amendment will require the approval of the company s shareholders  and it is expected that such amendment will be submitted to the shareholders for approval at the company s next annual meeting of shareholders 
under the order the bank s board of directors must also increase its participation in the affairs of the bank  assuming full responsibility for the approval of sound policies and objectives and for the supervision of all the bank s activities 
the board of directors believes it has always provided appropriate oversight of the bank  but has recently taken additional steps to reevaluate such oversight and enhance where appropriate the frequency and duration and the scope and depth of matters covered at its board meetings in response to the current economic environment and concerns raised in the roe 
in direct response to the roe  a new joint regulatory compliance committee was formed at both the bank and company levels to oversee the bank s and company s response to all regulatory matters  including the order and the written agreement  discussed below

the order further requires the bank to increase its allowance for loan losses alll  as of the date of the roe  by million and to review and revise its alll methodology 
the bank subsequently made provision of approximately million for alll during the third and fourth quarters of the bank is currently in the process of revising its policy for determining the adequacy of the alll to include an assessment of market conditions and other qualitative factors 
the bank s policy otherwise continues to provide for a comprehensive determination of the adequacy of its alll which is to be reviewed promptly and regularly at least once each calendar quarter and be properly reported  and any deficiency in the allowance must be remedied in the calendar quarter it is discovered  by a charge to current operating earnings 
with respect to classified assets as of the date of the roe  the order also requires the bank to charge off or collect all assets classified as loss and one half of the assets classified as doubtful  and within days of the order  to reduce its level of assets classified as substandard to no more than the greater of million or of tier capital plus the alll 
as of december   the bank met the requirement to charge off or collect all assets classified as loss and one half of the assets classified as doubtful as of the date of the roe 
the bank is currently pursuing strategies to reduce its substandard assets in an effort to comply with this requirement 
additionally  upon downstream of a majority of the funds the company raised in its march private placement  the bank will have substantially met this requirement 
the bank presently expects to fully comply with this requirement within the day time limit 
the bank has also developed and implemented a process for the review and approval of all applicable asset disposition plans 
the order requires that the bank develop or revise  adopt and implement a plan  which must be approved by the fdic and dfi  to reduce the amount of commercial real estate loans extended  particularly focusing on reducing loans for construction and land development 
in addition  the bank is to develop a plan for reducing the number of watch list credits to an acceptable level  and develop or revise its written lending and collection policies to provide more effective guidance and control over the bank s lending function 
the bank is currently in the process of developing a plan to comply with this provision of the order 
the order restricts the bank from taking certain actions without the consent of the fdic and the dfi  including paying cash dividends  and from extending additional credit to borrowers of loans charged off or classified as loss  substandard  or doubtful in the roe 
the bank has not paid cash dividends since the first quarter of in addition  the bank has put processes and controls in place to ensure extensions of credit  directly or indirectly  are not granted to those borrowers of loans charged off or classified as loss  substandard or doubtful in the roe 
the bank has also acknowledged that neither the loan committee nor the board of directors will approve any extension to a borrower classified substandard or doubtful in the roe without first collecting all past due interest in cash 
the order further requires the bank to develop or revise  adopt and implement a revised liquidity policy  and to adopt a contingency funding plan to adequately address contingency funding sources and appropriately reduce contingency funding reliance on off balance sheet sources 
the bank is currently in the process of revising its current liquidity policy and has developed a new contingency funding plan 
the order also requires that the bank prepare and submit to the regulators a revised business plan  that is to include a comprehensive budget  and a year strategic plan  and to further revise its investment policy 
the bank has since prepared a comprehensive budget and revised the investment policy and is in the process of developing a revised business plan and year strategic plan 
on march   the company entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve board the written agreement  which requires the company to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness

capital standards the federal reserve board and the fdic have adopted risk based minimum capital guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as business loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets 
the regulators measure risk adjusted assets  which include off balance sheet items  against both total qualifying capital the sum of tier i capital and limited amounts of tier ii capital and tier i capital 
tier i capital consists primarily of common stock  retained earnings  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock cumulative perpetual preferred stock for bank holding companies and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most intangible assets and any amount of a bank s net deferred tax asset deemed to be disallowed 
tier ii capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for possible loan losses  cumulative preferred stock  long term preferred stock  eligible term subordinated debt and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity 
the inclusion of elements of tier ii capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies 
the federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier i capital to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier i capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets is 
for all banking organizations not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio must be at least 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy 
such a change could affect the ability of the company to grow and could restrict the amount of profits  if any  available for the payment of dividends 
the regulatory capital requirements  as well as the actual capital ratios for the bank and the company as of december   are presented in detail in note regulatory matters  of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k 
see also capital within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
as of december   both the bank and the company exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be well capitalized 
however  please also see the discussion titled regulatory order and written agreement under the section supervision and regulation of item business  of this form k for enhanced capital requirements for the bank as well as a discussion of the recent capital raise completed in march under applicable regulatory guidelines  the company s trust preferred securities issued by our subsidiary capital trusts qualify as tier i capital up to a maximum limit of of total tier i capital 
any additional portion of the trust preferred securities would qualify as tier ii capital 
as of december   the subsidiary trusts had million in trust preferred securities outstanding  of which million qualify as tier i capital 
in addition  the dfi has authority to take possession of the business and properties of a bank in the event that the tangible shareholders equity of a bank is less than the greater of i of the banks total assets or ii  prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios described above 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver or the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a depository institution  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
additionally  a holding company s inability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banking organizations could serve as an additional basis for a regulatory action against the holding company 
please also refer to the discussion titled regulatory order and written agreement under this section supervision and regulation of item business of this form k 
banks are also subject to certain federal reserve board restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons ie  insiders 
extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms and pursuant to the same credit underwriting procedures as those for comparable transactions with persons who are neither insiders nor employees  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders 
a violation of these restrictions may result in regulatory sanctions on the bank or its insiders 
safety and soundness standards the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia imposes certain specific restrictions on transactions and requires federal banking regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control  loan underwriting and documentation and asset growth 
among other things  fdicia limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions  restricts the use of brokered deposits  limits the aggregate extensions of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer  director  principal shareholder or related interest  and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts 
the federal banking agencies may require an institution to submit to an acceptable compliance plan as well as have the flexibility to pursue other more appropriate or effective courses of action given the specific circumstances and severity of an institution s noncompliance with one or more standards 
premiums for deposit insurance the bank s deposits have historically been insured by the fdic up to  per insured depositor  except certain types of retirement accounts  which are insured up to  per insured depositor 
on october   the maximum amount insured under fdic deposit insurance was temporarily increased from  to  per insured depositor through december  this increase was part of the emergency economic stabilization act of additionally  the bank has elected to participate in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
under this program  all non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts at the bank with balances over  will also be fully insured through june  at an additional cost to the bank of basis points per dollar over  on a per account basis 
the fdic has set a designated reserve ratio of against of insured deposits for the deposit insurance fund dif 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of fdic act provides the fdic board of directors the authority to set the designated reserve ratio between and 
the fdic must adopt a restoration plan when the reserve ratio falls below and begin paying dividends when the reserve ratio exceeds 
the dif reserve ratio calculated by the fdic that was in effect at december  was 
through the later part of and into the number of bank and thrift failures began to rise significantly  resulting from  among other things  the us financial crisis and significantly weakened economic conditions 
this placed considerable strain on the fdic s dif 
as a result  on september  the fdic adopted an amended restoration plan to allow the dif to return to a ratio of within eight years 
the fdic also adopted higher annual risk based assessment rates beginning in january of on november  the fdic also adopted a final rule amending the assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay their quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of  and  on december   except for those institutions where the fdic grants an exemption 
the bank was notified in the fourth quarter of by the fdic that it was exempt from prepayment of assessments for  and under the fdic s amended restoration plan  due in large part to the recent consent order issued to the bank  as more fully discussed under regulatory order and written agreement under this section supervision and regulation of item business of this form k and recent developments of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note subsequent events of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k 
however  the bank currently anticipates its quarterly assessments will increase significantly during the next three years 
it is currently estimated that assessments against the bank for will total approximately million compared to the approximately million reported for the year ended december  in  fdic regulations established a new risk based assessment system under which deposit insurance assessments are based upon supervisory ratings for all insured institutions  financial ratios for most institutions  and long term debt issuer ratings for large institutions that have them 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance if it finds that the institution is being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner or has violated any rule  regulation  order or condition administered by the institution s regulatory authorities 
any such termination of deposit insurance would likely have a material adverse effect on the bank  the severity of which would depend on the amount of deposits affected by such a termination 
under federal law  deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution  including federal funds and letters of credit  in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver appointed by regulatory authorities 
such priority creditors would include the fdic 
sarbanes oxley act of on july   the sarbanes oxley act of sox  was signed into law to address corporate and accounting fraud 
sox establishes a new accounting oversight board that will enforce auditing standards and restricts the scope of services that accounting firms may provide to their public company audit clients

financial services modernization legislation on november   the gramm leach bliley act of the financial services modernization act was signed into law 
the financial services modernization act is intended to modernize the banking industry by removing barriers to affiliation among banks  insurance companies  the securities industry and other financial service providers 
it provides financial organizations with the flexibility of structuring such affiliations through a holding company structure or through a financial subsidiary of a bank  subject to certain limitations 
the financial services modernization act establishes a new type of bank holding company  known as a financial holding company  which may engage in an expanded list of activities that are financial in nature  which include securities and insurance brokerage  securities underwriting  insurance underwriting and merchant banking 
the company has not sought financial holding company status and has no present plans to do so 
the financial services modernization act also sets forth a system of functional regulation that makes the federal reserve board the umbrella supervisor for holding companies  while providing for the supervision of the holding company s subsidiaries by other federal and state agencies 
in addition  the bank is subject to other provisions of the financial services modernization act  including those relating to cra  privacy and safe guarding confidential customer information  regardless of whether the company elects to become a financial holding company or to conduct activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company does not  however  currently intend to file notice with the federal reserve board to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded financial activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company and the bank do not believe that the financial services modernization act will have a material adverse effect on its operations in the near term 
however  to the extent that it permits banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the financial services modernization act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  this act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company faces from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the company 
usa patriot act of on october   the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism  or the patriot act  of was signed into law 
among other things  the patriot act i prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks  ii imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals  iii requires financial institutions to establish an anti money laundering compliance program  and iv eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports 
the patriot act also increases governmental powers to investigate terrorism  including expanded government access to account records and to make rules to implement the patriot act 
on march   the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act was signed into law  which extended and modified the original act 
while we believe the patriot act  as amended and reauthorized  may  to some degree  affect our operations  we do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
transactions between affiliates transactions between a bank and its affiliates are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the federal reserve act 
the federal reserve board issued regulation w on october   which comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
sections a and b and regulation w restrict loans by a depository institution to its affiliates  asset purchases by a depository institution from its affiliates  and other transactions between a depository institution and its affiliates 
regulation w unifies in one public document the federal reserve board s interpretations of section a and b 
regulation w had an effective date of april  community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving home mortgage lending operations and community reinvestment act cra activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws  the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra into account when regulating and supervising other activities 
when a bank holding company applies for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company  the federal reserve board will review the assessment of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
a bank s compliance with its cra obligations is based on a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on an institution s lending service and investment performance  resulting in a rating by the appropriate bank regulatory agency of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
in its last examination by the fdic  the bank received a cra rating of satisfactory 
privacy federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose non public information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
we have implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
in recent years  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
for example  in  california adopted standards that are more restrictive than federal law  allowing bank customers the opportunity to bar financial companies from sharing information with their affiliates 
predatory lending the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation  or asset based lending  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced  or loan flipping  and engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
federal reserve board regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widened the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 
the following triggers coverage under the home ownership and equity protection act of interest rates for first lien mortgage loans in excess of percentage points above comparable treasury securities  subordinate lien loans of percentage points above treasury securities  and fees such as optional insurance and similar debt protection costs paid in connection with the credit transaction  when combined with points and fees if deemed excessive 
in addition  the regulation bars loan flipping by the same lender or loan servicer within a year 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans shouldn t be made to people unable to repay them unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
the company does not expect these rules and potential state action in this area to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
bank secrecy act and money laundering control act in  congress passed the currency and foreign transactions reporting act  otherwise known as the bank secrecy act the bsa  which established requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial institutions 
the bsa was designed to help identify the source  volume and movement of currency and other monetary instruments into and out of the united states in order to help detect and prevent money laundering connected with drug trafficking  terrorism and other criminal activities 
the primary tool used to implement bsa requirements is the filing of suspicious activity reports 
today  the bsa requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions 
these programs must  at a minimum  provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance  provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance  designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training 
recent government actions in response to the financial crises emergency economic stabilization act in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  the emergency economic stabilization act eesa was signed into law on october   and established the troubled asset relief program tarp 
as part of tarp  the united states department of the treasury treasury established the capital purchase program cpp to provide up to billion of funding to eligible financial institutions through the purchase of capital stock and other financial instruments for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
in connection with eesa  there have been numerous actions by the frb  congress  and the treasury  the fdic  the sec and others to further the economic and banking industry stabilization efforts under eesa 
it remains unclear at this time what further legislative and regulatory measures will be implemented under eesa affecting the company 
the company participated in the cpp and on march   issued and sold  shares of its series a preferred stock to treasury  and issued warrants for the purchase of  shares  in exchange for million 
for further details on our participation in the cpp  please see note preferred stock  of the consolidated financial statements filed with this form k 
because of our participation in the cpp  we are subject to certain limitations on executive compensation and the payment of dividends 
the company believes it is fully compliant with all such limitations 
financial stability plan on february   treasury announced the financial stability plan fsp which  among other things  established a new capital assistance program cap through which eligible banking institutions will have access to treasury capital as a bridge to private capital until market conditions normalize  and extended the debt guarantee program of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to october  pursuant to which the fdic fully guaranteed certain newly issued senior unsecured debt and provided full fdic deposit insurance coverage for certain accounts  including noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
the fsp also extended the transaction account guarantee program of the tlgp to june  as a complement to cap  a new public private investment fund on an initial scale of up to billion  which was later revised to be billion  was announced to catalyze the removal of legacy assets from the balance sheets of financial institutions 
this fund will combine public and private capital with government financing to help free up capital to support new lending 
in addition  the existing term asset backed securities lending facility talf would be expanded up to trillion in order to reduce credit spreads and restart the securitized credit markets that in recent years supported a substantial portion of lending to households  students  small businesses  and others 
furthermore  the fsp proposed a new framework of governance and oversight to help ensure that banks receiving funds are held responsible for appropriate use of those funds through stronger conditions on lending  dividends and executive compensation along with enhanced reporting to the public 
american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law 
arra is intended to provide tax breaks for individuals and businesses  direct aid to distressed states and individuals  and provide infrastructure spending 
in addition  arra imposes new executive compensation and expenditure limits on all previous and future tarp recipients and expands the class of employees to whom the limits and restrictions apply 
arra also provides the opportunity for additional repayment flexibility for existing tarp recipients 
among other things  arra prohibits the payment of bonuses  other incentive compensation and severance to certain highly paid employees except in the form of restricted stock subject to specified limitations and conditions  and requires each tarp recipient to comply with certain other executive compensation related requirements 
these provisions modify the executive compensation provisions that were included in eesa  and in most instances apply retroactively for so long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided to the recipient under tarp remains outstanding 
in addition  arra directs the treasury to review previously paid bonuses  retention awards and other compensation paid to the senior executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees of each tarp recipient to determine whether any such payments were excessive  inconsistent with the purposes of arra or the tarp  or otherwise contrary to the public interest 
if the treasury determines that any such payments have been made by a tarp recipient  the treasury will seek to negotiate with the tarp recipient and the subject employee for appropriate reimbursements to the us government not the tarp recipient with respect to any such compensation or bonuses 
arra also permits the treasury  subject to consultation with the appropriate federal banking agency  to allow a tarp recipient to repay any assistance previously provided to such tarp recipient under the tarp  without regard to whether the tarp recipient has replaced such funds from any source  and without regard to any waiting period 
any tarp recipient that repays its tarp assistance pursuant to this provision would no longer be subject to the executive compensation provisions under arra 
homeowner affordability and stability plan on february   the treasury announced the homeowner affordability and stability plan hasp  which proposes to provide refinancing for certain homeowners  to support low mortgage rates by strengthening confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac  and to establish a homeowner stability initiative to reach at risk homeowners 
among other things  the homeowner stability initiative would offer monetary incentive to mortgage servicers and mortgage holders for certain modifications of at risk loans  and would establish an insurance fund designed to reduce foreclosures 
future legislation and regulatory initiatives various other legislative and regulatory initiatives  including proposals to overhaul the banking regulatory system are from time to time introduced in congress and state legislatures  as well as regulatory agencies 
currently  the congress is actively considering significant changes to the manner of regulating financial institutions including combining one or more of the frb  fdic  comptroller of the currency and the office of thrift supervision and creating a new consumer protection agency for financial products 
the current legislation being consider and other future legislation regarding financial institutions may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company and the bank in substantial and unpredictable ways  and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it or any implementing regulations  would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company or the bank 
the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions is unpredictable at this time 
the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that such potential legislation  if enacted  would have upon its financial condition or operations

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect our business are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our business 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this annual report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks associated with our business our banking subsidiary is operating under a consent agreement with the fdic and dfi and the company is operating under a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco to address  among other things  lending  credit and capital related issues 
in light of the current challenging operating environment  along with our elevated level of non performing assets  delinquencies  and adversely classified assets  we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and additional regulatory restrictions  and have become subject to certain enforcement actions under a consent order issued by the fdic and dfi to the bank on march  and written agreement with the federal reserve board entered into on march  these enforcement actions follow the fdics regularly scheduled examination of our banking subsidiary during the fourth quarter of and are based on discussions the bank had following the examination 
such enforcement actions place limitations on our business and may adversely affect our ability to implement our business plans 
these enforcement actions require  among other things  the bank to take certain steps to strengthen its balance sheet  such as reducing the level of classified assets  increasing capital levels  and addressing other criticisms of the examination 
these enforcement actions are more fully discussed in under supervision and regulation of part business of this form k  note subsequent events of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k as well as recent developments under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if the company fails to comply with these enforcement actions  it may become subject to further regulatory enforcement actions up to and including the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank 
even though the bank remains well capitalized  the regulatory agencies have the authority to restrict our operations to those consistent with adequately capitalized institutions 
for example  the regulatory agencies have imposed restrictions that place limitations on our lending activities 
the regulatory agencies also have the power to limit the rates paid by the bank to attract retail deposits in its local markets 
the bank is required to reduce our levels of non performing assets within specified time frames 
these time frames might not necessarily result in maximizing the price that might otherwise be received for the underlying properties 
in addition  if such restrictions were also imposed upon other institutions that operate in the bank s markets  multiple institutions disposing of properties at the same time could further diminish the potential proceeds received from the sale of these properties 
it should be noted that the company recently completed a private placement in march  raising gross proceeds of approximately million with an additional million in escrow for a second closing 
for additional information regarding the private placement please see note subsequent events of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k 
we cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economic downturn on our future results of operations or market price of our stock the national economy and the financial services sector in particular  are currently facing challenges of a scope unprecedented in recent history 
we cannot accurately predict the severity or duration of the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted the markets we serve 
any further deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our markets would have an adverse effect  which could be material  on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects  and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our level of classified assets expose us to increased lending risk 
further  if our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio  our earnings could decrease at december   loans that we have categorized as doubtful and substandard totaled million of which approximately million were non accruing 
these loans represent of total gross loans as of december  if these loans do not perform according to their terms and or the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  we may experience loan losses  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
at december   our allowance for loan losses totaled million  which represented of total loans and of non performing loans 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and their probability of making payment  as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  significant factors we consider include loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  trends and absolute levels of classified loans  trends and absolute levels in delinquent loans  trends in risk ratings  trends in industry charge offs by particular segments and changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our lending areas and the national economy 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
material additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income 
our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
please also refer to regulatory order and written agreement under the section supervision and regulation of item business of this form k for additional information on regulatory requirements regarding the bank s allowance for loan losses 
we are highly dependent on real estate and any further downturn in the real estate market may hurt our business a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
at december   real estate served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately of our loan portfolio 
a decline in current economic conditions  a decline in the local housing market  both of which we are experiencing currently  or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans and the value of real estate owned by us  as well as our financial condition and results of operations in general and the market value of our common stock 
acts of nature  including earthquakes  floods and fires  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans  may also negatively impact our financial condition 
we also have a concentration in higher risk commercial real estate loans we also have a high concentration in commercial real estate cre loans 
cre loans as defined by final guidance issued by bank regulators are defined as construction  land development  other land loans  loans secured by multifamily or more residential properties  and loans secured by non farm nonresidential properties 
following this definition  approximately of our lending portfolio can be classified as cre lending as of december  of total cre balances approximately consisted of loans secured by real estate in the hospitality industry as of december  cre loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential mortgage lending due  among other things  to the large amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
losses incurred on loans to a small number of borrowers could have a material adverse impact on our income and financial condition 
in addition  unlike residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans generally depend on the cash flow from the property to service the debt 
cash flow may be significantly affected by general economic conditions 
this is especially true with regard to our hospitality loans as cash flows are affected by occupancy rates  which have declined as people are traveling less due to economic conditions 
losses incurred on loans to a small number of borrowers could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
also  many of our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a family residential mortgage loan 
additionally  federal banking regulators recently issued final guidance regarding commercial real estate lending 
this guidance suggests that institutions that are potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk will be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny 
institutions that have experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  have notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate lending  or are approaching or exceed certain supervisory criteria that measure an institution s commercial real estate portfolio against its capital levels  may be subject to such increased regulatory scrutiny 
we have become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny because of our commercial real estate portfolio and as a result the bank must develop or revise  adopt  and implement a plan to systematically reduce the amount of loans within this category as outlined in the consent order issued to the bank on march  the unseasoned nature of a large portion of our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios may result in changes in estimating collectability  which may lead to additional provisions or charge offs  which could hurt our profits our commercial real estate cre  as previously defined  and commercial and industrial loan portfolios have increased million or from the end of through december  accordingly  much of these loan portfolios are unseasoned 
these loans also have not been subjected to continued declining and unfavorable economic conditions 
as a result  it may be difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio 
these loans may have delinquency or charge off levels above our historical experience  which could adversely affect our future performance 
further  these types of loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater risk than family residential mortgage loans 
accordingly  if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans  any resulting charge offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred historically with our residential mortgage loan or consumer loan portfolios 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
additionally  we regularly monitor certain larger deposit relationships that we determine are not suitable for any form of long term investment or that possess a higher risk of leaving us 
these balances are disclosed in deposits and borrowed funds under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on this form k 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in general 
we depend on cash dividends from our subsidiary bank to meet our cash obligations  but our consent order and written agreement prohibit the payment of such dividends without prior regulatory approval  which may impair our ability to fulfill our obligations as a holding company  dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities  our preferred stock and other obligations  including any cash dividends 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our subsidiary bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
as outlined in the consent order  previously mentioned  and written agreement  the bank cannot pay any cash dividends or other payments to the holding company without prior written consent of the regulatory authorities 
additionally  the company cannot declare or pay any dividends including those on outstanding preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program or make any distributions of principal  interest or other sums on its trust preferred securities without prior written approval of the federal reserve 
the recession and changes in domestic and foreign financial markets have adversely affected our industry and may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition economic indices have shown that since the fourth quarter of  the united states economy has been in a recession 
this has been reflected in significant business failures and job losses 
further  dramatic declines in the housing market  with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
general downward economic trends  reduced availability of commercial credit and increased unemployment  have negatively impacted the performance of commercial and consumer credit resulting in additional write downs 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity 
financial institutions have experienced decreased access to deposits and borrowings 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we potentially face increased regulation of our industry  compliance with which may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates  which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
the value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected 
we may be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recently enacted legislation and other measures undertaken by the us treasury  the frb and other governmental agencies may not help stabilize the us financial system or improve the housing market on october   president bush signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa  which  among other measures  authorized the treasury secretary to establish the troubled asset relief program tarp 
eesa gives broad authority to treasury to purchase  manage  modify  sell and insure the troubled mortgage related assets that triggered the current economic crisis as well as other troubled assets 
eesa includes additional provisions directed at bolstering the economy  including authority for the frb to pay interest on depository institution balances  mortgage loss mitigation and homeowner protection  temporary increase in fdic insurance coverage from  to  through december   and authority to the sec to suspend mark to market accounting requirements for any issuer or class of category of transactions 
pursuant to the tarp  the treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
under the tarp  the treasury has created a capital purchase program  pursuant to which it is providing access to capital to financial institutions through a standardized program to acquire preferred stock accompanied by warrants from eligible financial institutions that will serve as tier capital 
eesa also contains a number of significant employee benefit and executive compensation provisions  some of which apply to employee benefit plans generally  and others which impose on financial institutions that participate in the tarp program restrictions on executive compensation 
eesa followed  and has been followed by  numerous actions by the frb  congress  treasury  the sec and others to address the liquidity and credit crisis that has followed the sub prime meltdown that commenced in these measures include homeowner relief that encourage loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
on october   the fdic announced the establishment of a temporary liquidity guarantee program to provide insurance for all non interest bearing transaction accounts and guarantees of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by financial institutions such as the bank and bank holding companies such as the company 
under the program  newly issued senior unsecured debt issued on or before june  will be insured in the event the issuing institution subsequently fails  or its holding company files for bankruptcy 
the debt includes all newly issued unsecured senior debt eg  promissory notes  commercial paper and inter bank funding 
the aggregate coverage for an institution may not exceed of its debt outstanding on december  that was scheduled to mature before june  the guarantee will extend to june  even if the maturity of the debt is after that date 
on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus bill  more commonly known as the economic stimulus or economic recovery package 
the stimulus bill includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health and education needs 
in addition  the stimulus bill imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients that are in addition to those previously announced by the us treasury 
the actual impact that eesa  the stimulus bill and such related measures undertaken to alleviate the credit crisis will have generally on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced  is unknown 
the failure of such measures to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced significant downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our ability to access capital and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fdic deposit insurance assessments will increase substantially  which will adversely affect our net earnings fdic deposit insurance expense for the year ended december  was approximately million 
deposit insurance assessments will increase in due to recent strains on the fdic deposit insurance fund resulting from the cost of recent bank failures and an increase in the number of banks likely to fail over the next few years 
during the latter half of the fdic issued a final ruling requiring insured institutions  exclusive of those granted an exemption  to pre pay their regulatory assessments for  and although the bank was granted an exemption from the fdic  we currently anticipate fdic assessment costs to increase in  due primarily to a change in risk ratings 
the bank currently anticipates these costs to total approximately million for declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investments  financial performance and capital we maintain an investment portfolio that includes  but is not limited to  mortgage backed securities 
the market value of investments in our portfolio has become increasingly volatile over the past year 
the market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the servicer of the securities or the mortgages underlying the securities  such as ratings downgrades  adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
we may be required to record impairment charges if our investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other than temporary 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to charge against earnings the credit related portion of the other than temporary impairment  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the write offs occur 
during  the bank determined several non agency collateralized mortgage obligations in the investment portfolio to be other than temporarily impaired otti and as a result wrote down the value of those securities by approximately million

our real estate lending also exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities in the course of our business  we may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third persons for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates may adversely affect our performance and financial condition our earnings and cash flows are highly dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
our net interest income including net interest spread and margin and ultimately our earnings are impacted by changes in interest rates and monetary policy 
changes in interest rates and monetary policy can impact the demand for new loans  the credit profile of our borrowers  the yields earned on loans and securities and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
given our current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  we would expect our interest rate spread the difference in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and the yields earned on interest earning assets as well as net interest income to increase if interest rates rise and  conversely  to decline if interest rates fall 
additionally  increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may decrease our net interest spread as well as net interest margin by forcing us to offer lower lending interest rates and pay higher deposit interest rates 
although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates such as a sudden and substantial increase in prime and overnight fed funds rates as well as increasing competition may require the bank to increase rates on deposits at a faster pace than the yield it receives on interest earning assets increases 
the impact of any sudden and substantial move in interest rates and or increased competition may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as the bank s net interest income including the net interest spread and margin may be negatively impacted 
additionally  a sustained decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings 
when interest rates decline  borrowers tend to refinance higher rate  fixed rate loans at lower rates  prepaying their existing loans 
under those circumstances  we would not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on the prepaid loans 
in addition  our commercial real estate and commercial loans  which carry interest rates that  in general  adjust in accordance with changes in the prime rate  will adjust to lower rates 
we are also significantly affected by the level of loan demand available in our market 
the inability to make sufficient loans directly affects the interest income we earn 
lower loan demand will generally result in lower interest income realized as we place funds in lower yielding investments 
failure to successfully execute our strategy may adversely affect our performance our financial performance and profitability depends on our ability to execute our corporate growth strategy 
continued growth  however  may present operating and other problems that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced 
factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long term financial performance goals include those stated elsewhere in this section  as well as inability to control non interest expense  including  but not limited to  rising employee  regulatory compliance  and healthcare costs  limitations imposed on us in the consent order and or written agreement 
inability to increase non interest income  and continuing ability to expand  through de novo branching or finding acquisition targets at valuation levels we find attractive 
economic conditions in the central coast of california area may adversely affect our operations and or cause us to sustain losses our retail and commercial banking operations are concentrated primarily in san luis obispo and santa barbara counties 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results of operations depend largely upon economic conditions in this area 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of our borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
this risk increases when the economy is weak 
the industries of tourism  agriculture specifically that related to the production of wine and hospitality represent a significant portion of economic activity in our primary market area have been impacted to some degree by the current economic downturn 
although the company has not seen any significant increase in non performing assets related to loans the bank has made to borrowers in these industries  the company believes a prolonged economic downturn may have an impact on such borrowers  which may result in further increases in the level of our non performing assets 
we have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses that management believes is appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our loan portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that may have material adverse affects on our results of operations in general and the market value of our stock 
additionally  our primary market area is an increasingly competitive and overcrowded banking market 
our ability to achieve the growth outlined in our corporate strategic goals may be dependent in part on an ability to grow through the successful addition of new branches or the identification and acquisition of potential targets at acceptable pricing levels either inside or outside of our primary market 
if we are unable to attract significant new business through strategic branching  or acquire new business through the acquisition of other banks  our growth in loans and deposits and  therefore  our earnings  may be adversely affected 
we face strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking services  which may hurt our business as previously mentioned  the financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we face competition both in attracting quality assets and deposits and in making loans 
we compete for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees we charge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may reduce our market share  decrease loan demand  cause the prices we charge for our services to fall  or decrease our net interest margin by forcing us to offer lower lending interest rates and pay higher rates on our deposits 
therefore  our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature or level of competition 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most of our activities can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
because of our participation in the troubled asset relief program tarp  we are subject to several restrictions  including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance apply to us for the period during which the us treasury holds an equity position in us 
these standards generally apply to our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers 
the standards include  among other things  ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes  executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation may increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods 
pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus bill  more commonly known as the economic stimulus recovery package  further compensation restrictions  including significant limitations on incentive compensation  have been imposed on our senior executive officers and most highly compensated employees 
such restrictions and any future restrictions on executive compensation  which may be adopted  could adversely affect our ability to hire and retain senior executive officers 
our internal operations are subject to a number of risks we are subject to certain operations risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
we maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable  but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls  uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits  it could have a significant adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
information systems we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
technological advances the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
for example  the central coast of california is subject to earthquakes and fires 
operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities 
while we have not experienced such an occurrence to date  other severe weather or natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on cash dividends from our subsidiary bank to meet our cash obligations as a holding company  dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities and other obligations  including any cash dividends 
see item market for common equity and related stockholder matters 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our subsidiary bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
additionally  the consent order and written agreement we are operating under prohibit our banking subsidiary from paying dividends or any form of payment to the holding company that would represent a reduction in the subsidiary bank s capital 
for more information regarding the consent order and written agreement  please see the discussion titled consent order and written agreement under the section supervision and regulation of item business  recent developments under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note subsequent events of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k 
risks associated with our industry we are subject to government regulation that may limit or restrict our activities  which in turn may adversely impact our operations the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  and not to benefit our shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations 
new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or repeal of existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our business 
we anticipate that continued compliance with various regulatory provisions will impact future operating expenses 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects economic conditions for us 
new legislative and regulatory proposals may affect our operations and growth proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of  and federal insurance premiums paid by  banks and other financial institutions and companies that control such institutions are frequently raised in the us congress  state legislatures and before bank regulatory authorities 
the likelihood of any major changes in the future and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine 
similarly  proposals to change the accounting treatment applicable to banks and other depository institutions are frequently raised by the sec  the federal banking agencies  the irs and other appropriate authorities 
the likelihood and impact of any additional future changes in law or regulation and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine at this time 
risks associated with our stock our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program cpp may pose certain risks to holders of our common stock under the terms of the cpp  the company sold to the us treasury million in preferred stock and a warrant to purchase approximately million of the company s common stock 
although the company believes that its participation in the cpp is in the best interests of our shareholders in that it will enhance company and bank capital and provide additional funds for future growth  it may pose certain risks to the holders of our common stock such as the following under the terms outlined by the us treasury for participants in the cpp  the company issued a warrant to the u 
s treasury to purchase shares of its common stock 
the issuance of this warrant is dilutive to current common stockholders in that it reduces earnings per common share 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant is exercised 
the shares of common stock underlying the warrant represent approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outstanding 
although the us treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction and therefore may become a significant holder of the company s common stock and possess significant voting power 
although the preferred equity issued to the us treasury is non voting  the terms of the cpp stipulate that the us treasury may vote their senior equity in matters deemed by the us treasury to have an impact on their holdings 
the purchase agreement between the company and the u 
s treasury provides that before the earlier of march  and the date on which all of the shares of the preferred stock have been redeemed by us or transferred by the us treasury to third parties  we may not  without consent of the us treasury  a increase the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock above per share  the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to october  or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock other than the preferred stock 
in addition  we are unable to pay any dividends on our common stock unless we are current in our dividend payments on the preferred stock 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant issued to the us treasury  may have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
although the company does not foresee any material changes to the terms associated with its participation in the cpp  the us government  as a sovereign body  may at any time change the terms of our participation in the cpp and or significantly influence company policy 
for more information about the company s participation in the cpp  see note preferred stock  of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k 
our outstanding preferred stock impacts net income available to our common stockholders and earnings per common share and other potential issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to holders of our common stock the dividends declared and the accretion on our outstanding preferred stock will reduce the net income available to common stockholders and our earnings per common share 
the preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of the company s liquidation  dissolution or winding down 
in addition  to the extent options to purchase common stock under our employee and director stock option plans are exercised  holders of our common stock will incur additional dilution 
further  if the company sells additional equity or convertible debt securities  such sales may result in increased dilution to our shareholders 
our stock trades less frequently than others although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global market  the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given the lower trading volume of our common stock  significant sales of our common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause our stock price to fall 
our stock price is affected by a variety of factors stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors discussed in this section  including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  recommendations by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  and perceptions in the marketplace regarding our company and or its competitors and the industry in which we operate 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the public offering price 
in addition  the stock markets  from time to time  experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our trading performance 
we recently raised additional capital  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock 
we frequently evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets  taking into account our regulatory capital ratios  financial condition and other relevant considerations 
in march of  the company raised gross proceeds of approximately million though the issuance of mandatorily convertible preferred stock and an additional million was placed in escrow for a second closing  as more fully disclosed in note subsequent events of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k 
these securities are convertible into shares of the company s common stock  which will significantly dilute the interests of current common shareholders upon conversion and may impact the price of our common stock 
in addition  we face significant regulatory and other governmental risk as a financial institution and a participant in the cpp and it is possible that capital requirements and directives may  in the future  require us to change the amount or composition of our current capital  including common equity 
in this regard  we note that we were not one of the institutions required to conduct a forward looking capital assessment or stress test 
however  the stress assessment requirements under the capital assistance program or similar requirement could be extended to us 
as a result  we may determine  or our regulators may require us  to raise additional capital in addition to the capital raise we recently completed in march there may also be market perceptions regarding the capital we raised or the need to raise additional capital  whether as a result of public disclosures that were made regarding the capital assistance program stress test methodology or otherwise and  regardless of the outcome of the stress tests or other stress case analysis  such perceptions may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders we have supported our continued growth through two issuances of trust preferred securities from two separate special purpose trusts 
at december   we had outstanding trust preferred securities totaling million 
payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these special purpose trusts are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
further  the accompanying junior subordinated debentures we issued to the special purpose trusts are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no cash dividends may be paid on our common stock 
our common stock is not an insured deposit our common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire our common stock  you may lose some or all of your investment 
our articles of incorporation and by laws  as well as certain banking laws  may have an anti takeover effect provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders 
the combination of these provisions may hinder a non negotiated merger or other business combination  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale or perceived threat of sale of the million shares of common stock that will be issued if our recently sold preferred stock is converted and that we are obligated to register for re sale by investors in our march private capital raise may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
the market value of our common stock may be adversely affected by sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur 
in our march private offering  we issued mandatorily convertible preferred securities that represent up to million shares of common stock  assuming all shares of preferred stock are issued 
we presently have million shares of common stock outstanding

the corporation law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if the corporation s retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution 
the corporation law also provides that  in the event that sufficient retained earnings are not available for the proposed distribution  a corporation may nevertheless make a distribution to its shareholders if it meets two conditions  which generally stated are as follows i the corporation s assets equal at least times its liabilities  and ii the corporation s current assets equal at least its current liabilities or  if the average of the corporation s earnings before taxes on income and before interest expenses for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the corporation s interest expenses for such fiscal years  then the corporation s current assets must equal at least times its current liabilities 
refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on junior subordinated debenture limitations on dividends 
the ability of the company to pay a cash dividend and to service the debt on its junior subordinated debentures depends largely on the bank s ability to pay a cash dividend to the company 
the payment of cash dividends by the bank is subject to restrictions set forth in the california financial code the financial code 
the financial code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of a bank s retained earnings  or b bank s net income for its last three fiscal years  less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority owned subsidiary of the bank to the shareholders of the bank during such period 
however  a bank may  with the approval of the dfi  make a distribution to its shareholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of x its retained earnings  y its net income for its last fiscal year  or z its net income for its current fiscal year 
in the event that the dfi determines that the shareholders equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound  the dfi may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution 
the fdic may also restrict the payment of dividends if such payment would be deemed unsafe or unsound or if after the payment of such dividends  the bank would be included in one of the undercapitalized categories for capital adequacy purposes pursuant to federal law 
see  item description of business prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms

increases within this category in can be attributed in large part to the acquisition of business first national bank as well as higher net sundry losses 
provision for income taxes the amount of the tax provision is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income  adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
such permanent differences include  but are not limited to  tax exempt interest income and earnings on bank owned life insurance 
for the year ended december  the company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million 
for the years ended december  and provision for income taxes was million and million  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was impacted significantly by the substantial provisions the bank made to the allowance for loan losses during those years  significantly reducing pre tax income 
as a result  income from permanent items such as interest on municipal securities and earnings on holdings of bank owned life insurance had a greater impact on the income tax provision than in prior periods 
provision for loan losses an allowance for loan losses has been established by management to provide for those loans that may not be repaid in their entirety for a variety of reasons 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for probable incurred losses 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and is reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which includes  among other things  an analysis of past loan loss experience and management s evaluation of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
the bank recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the bank s best estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for probable estimable losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in making this determination  the bank analyzes the ultimate collectability of loans in the portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff  management s findings from internal loan reviews  findings from an independent semi annual loan review function  and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the bank makes monthly evaluations as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and makes adjustments to the related provision for loan losses accordingly 
the bank accounts for problem loans in accordance with accounting guidance provided under us gaap 
us gaap provides that when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan that such loan is deemed impaired 
impaired loans are accounted for differently in that the amount of the impairment is measured and reflected in the records of the creditor 
the allowance for loan losses related to loans that are identified for evaluation in accordance with accounting guidance under us gaap is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
when the bank determines a loan to be impaired  an analysis is performed to determine the extent of the impairment and specific reserves may be established for such loans  which in many cases requires the bank to make additional provisions for loan losses in addition to any provisions required under management s monthly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance  exclusive of the impact that such impaired loans may have on the required balance of the allowance and the related provision for loan losses 
management s discussion and analysis the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed monthly by the bank s directors  loan committee and full board of directors  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the provision for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision for loan losses for the year ended december  is consistent with prior periods 
the bank s provision for loan losses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and provisions for loan losses in were approximately million higher than that reported for as economic conditions throughout the later part of and into worsened on national  state and local levels  the bank moved to increase the allowance as required by monthly analyses it conducts in determining its adequacy to cover potential losses in the loan portfolio 
in addition  during the third quarter of the bank s independent loan review firm completed its semi annual loan portfolio examination that augments management s internal loan review 
as a result of feedback from this review  in connection with management s own effort to identify and reserve for perceived credit risks in the portfolio and due to the continuation of worsening economic conditions  the level of non accruing loans increased significantly in from that reported at december  the balance of non performing loans at december  totaled approximately million  an increase of approximately million or from that reported at december  this increase in non performing loans contributed significantly to the increased provisions for loan losses in in the first quarter of and in expectation of due diligence to be conducted as part of the capital raise completed in march  the bank contracted with an independent third party to perform an aggressive credit review of of the largest commercial and commercial real estate loans held by the bank 
the total principal balance reviewed was approximately million or approximately of the outstanding loan portfolio as of the review date 
the objective of this review was to determine loans that had cash flow or repayment weaknesses as measured by their ability to service debt from a historical perspective  and  which also had some collateral deficiencies or unknown collateral values to identify a possible worst case scenario for performance of the bank s commercial and commercial real estate portfolio utilizing certain assumptions about the performance of such loans within certain risk grading classifications 
based solely on assumptions about the performance of loans within certain risk grading classifications and extrapolating the potential loss over the remaining portfolio  the review identified certain additional levels of potential problem credits 
the bank is using this information to assist in identifying credit weaknesses earlier in the cycle to help mitigate future losses 
the bank employs the use of a watch list and loan grading system to assist in monitoring the quality of certain credits in the loan portfolio 
as loans on the watch list and any other loan within the portfolio experience deterioration  the bank typically moves to downgrade such loans  resulting in an increase in the required allowance to cover any potential losses 
during  the bank further expanded the list of credits it has placed on the watch list in an effort to add additional oversight and to more closely scrutinize certain groups of loans that have experienced deterioration as a result of  among other things  the continued weakened state of local  state and national economic environments 
management believes the significant economic downturn witnessed during and that continued into has had a considerable impact on the ability of certain borrowers to satisfy their obligations to the bank  resulting in continued watch list expansion  loan downgrades and corresponding increases in loan loss provisions 
at december  the balance of loans the bank has graded substandard totaled approximately million  of which approximately million were non accruing 
when compared to the million in substandard balances as december   substandard balances increased approximately million during the bank also makes estimates as to the impact that certain economic factors will have on various credits within the portfolio 
negative economic trends witnessed during continued in and contributed substantially to increases in the required allowance to cover potential losses in the loan portfolio  resulting in year over year increases in loan loss provisions 
charge offs during the year ended december  totaled approximately million  an increase of approximately million when compared to the million in charge offs reported for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net charge offs to average loans were compared to the reported for the year ended december  during the majority of charge offs occurred in the commercial and industrial  agriculture  construction and land segments of the loan portfolio  increasing significantly over charge offs reported in those categories for and were mainly attributable to several large write downs 
these losses in conjunction with an increase in the number and total dollar volume of past due and non accruing loans within these segments contributed further to the additional provisions the bank made to the allowance for loan losses during when compared to continued increases in the level of charge offs  the number and dollar volume of past due  non accruing and non performing loans and any further significant downturn in economic conditions may result in further significant provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
management s discussion and analysis looking forward into  management anticipates there to be continued weakness in economic conditions on national  state and local levels compared to historical periods 
many economic forecasts suggest there may be further increases in the national unemployment rate  which will undoubtedly place continued pressure on conditions within the bank s primary market area 
continued economic pressures may negatively impact the financial condition of borrowers to whom the bank has extended credit and as a result the bank may be required to make further significant provisions to the allowance for loan losses during that said  management has and will continue to be proactive in looking for signs of deterioration within the loan portfolio in an effort to manage credit quality and work with borrowers where possible to mitigate any further losses 
financial condition at december  total assets were million 
when compared to the million reported at december   total assets increased by million 
the year over year increase in total assets is primarily attributable to a million increase in gross loan balances as well as a million increase in the balance of the investment portfolio 
asset growth in was due in large part to the significant increase in core deposit balances the bank witnessed during the year 
loan growth in was approximately million less than that reported for gross loans increased approximately million in compared to the million in growth witnessed in weakened economic conditions as well as a more selective stance on the types of loans the bank chooses to originate resulted in a lower level of loan growth during at december  total deposits were million or million higher than the million reported at the end of the bank placed considerable emphasis on deposit growth during in part to reduce wholesale funding balances and the reliance on brokered funds

higher commercial real estate balances in can be attributed in part to the completion of several large construction projects and their subsequent reclassification from construction to commercial real estate 
the aggregate balance of these large loans was approximately million at december  further contributing to the year over year increase in commercial real estate balances was the funding of one million credit during the third quarter of for the purpose of purchasing professional office space  occupied by three national tenants 
this credit was originated with a loan to value of and a debt coverage ratio of times

additionally  the bank charged off approximately million in construction balances during contributing further to the year over year decline was the reclassification of several large construction loans to the commercial real estate category following the completion of the underlying projects 
the bank classifies real estate construction loans as construction until projects are complete 
if upon the completion of construction the loan is retained  it is re classified as real estate secured 
at december  total construction commitments represented approximately of the bank s total risk based capital 
this when compared to the reported at december   represents a decline of approximately percentage points 
the additional capital obtained under the company s participation in the us treasury s cpp in conjunction with the items mentioned in the preceding paragraph contributed substantially to the year to date decline 
approximately million or of the bank s construction portfolio was considered owner occupied as of december  construction loans are typically granted for a one year period and then  with income properties  are amortized over a period not more than years with to year maturities 
all loans the bank originates that are considered construction or for acquisition and development are monitored by a construction budget 
draw requests are aligned with monthly projections and reviewed against documents submitted by the borrower 
in addition a third party construction inspector conducts regular on site visits to the project site and provides a written report comparing the loan balance to work completed  budget accuracy  as well as the adequacy of funds left to disburse against the remaining costs to complete the project 
as part of its ongoing monitoring of acquisition and development loans  the bank periodically evaluates the appropriateness of continued use of interest reserves 
various factors are considered by the bank when determining the continued use of an interest reserve with focus placed on certain red flags during the life cycle of acquisition and development projects acquisition  development  and construction 
such red flags are designed to alert the bank to potential significant delays or execution risk for the overall project  which would indicate that continued use of an interest reserve is not appropriate  and include such things as the borrower s delay  neglect  or failure to perform appropriate engineering and environmental studies  prepare site plans  submit formal applications to relevant planning and zoning authorities  subdivide  level  or grade the site  build out required site improvements  and properly manage the construction phase of the project 
management s discussion and analysis as of december  the bank has extended nine loans with interest reserves for various reasons in the normal course of business 
this would include  for example  allowing adequate time to complete the construction project  securing permanent financing or an sba guarantee 
no loans with interest reserves have been renewed or restructured 
the differences in underwriting practices for loans with interest reserves versus those without interest reserves are nominal 
the merits of any construction or acquisition and development loan are underwritten by examining the various financial and environmental factors specific to the project 
the viability of the project is then layered against the financial strength of the sponsor guarantor and their historical track record of performance 
this process is essentially the same whether the proposed loan will include an interest reserve or not 
at december  the outstanding balance of loans with an interest reserve totaled approximately million and interest reserves related to these loans totaling approximately million

summary of market condition prices of single family homes have fallen significantly from market highs seen in in california as a whole 
along with other segments in the real estate sector  commercial real estate prices in the company s market area experienced pressure during and the company has begun to see increases in vacancy rates in certain retail  industrial and office segments 
the most recent data available to the company shows vacancy rates within retail  industrial and office segments to be approximately  and  respectively as of the third quarter of this compares to  and  respectively as of the third quarter of the company realizes that any prolonged and significant downturn in the national  state and local economies may further impact the values of commercial real estate within its market footprint as well as the borrowers to whom the bank has extended such credit and as such vacancy rates may increase in future periods 
as such  management continues to closely monitor the credits within this segment of the loan portfolio for potential signs of deterioration 
additionally  the bank is aware that as economic conditions worsen and levels of unemployment continue to rise  borrowers to whom the bank has extended commercial lines of credit may come under additional pressure to satisfy their outstanding obligations 
that said  the bank continues to employ stringent lending standards and remains very selective with regard to any additional commercial real estate  real estate construction  land and commercial loans it chooses to originate in an effort to effectively manage risk in this difficult credit environment 
management s discussion and analysis although  the company s market footprint has historically enjoyed a more stable level of economic growth  we have not been immune to the effects of a slowdown on a state or national level 
as previously mentioned  with the effects of a weakened economy placing more pressure on borrowers  the ability of consumers to satisfy outstanding obligations to the financial sector  as a whole  has begun to languish 
we believe that within certain areas of our local economy these more macro level concerns have become more evident 
this has had an impact on the level of and type of loans the bank has placed on non accrual and charged off during and additionally  the company has devoted considerable resources to the monitoring of credits within the loan portfolio in order to take any appropriate steps when and if necessary to mitigate any material adverse impact the effects of weakened economic conditions may have on the bank overall 
as of december   a substantial portion of loans the bank originated within the major categories of commercial real estate  construction  land  and commercial and industrial were made to borrowers within our current market footprint 
credit quality while the bank continues to adhere to prudent underwriting standards  the credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio is impacted by numerous factors  including the economic environment in the markets it operates and its impact on real estate prices securing collateral dependent loans in the bank s loan portfolio 
weakened economic conditions have had  and if continue to persist  may further impact real estate used as collateral for certain loans the bank has made 
additionally  weak economic conditions have impacted certain borrowers to who the bank has extended credit  making it difficult and in some cases impossible for those borrowers to continue to make scheduled loan payments 
an inability of certain borrowers to continue to perform under the original terms of their respective loan agreements in conjunction with declines in collateral values has resulted in and if such conditions continue  may result in further increases in provisions for loan losses and have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
in an effort to manage credit quality the bank monitors loans in the portfolio with the assistance of a semi annual independent loan review to identify and mitigate any potential credit quality issues and losses in a proactive manner 
management s review in conjunction with the semi annual independent review focuses on non watch related credits within certain pools of loans that may be expected to experience stress due to economic conditions 
this process allows the bank to validate credit ratings  underwriting structure and the bank s estimated exposure in the current economic environment and enhance communications with borrowers where necessary ultimately in an effort to mitigate potential losses to the bank 
has proven to be a difficult year for the bank 
significantly weakened economic conditions have resulted in a considerable increase in the number and dollar volume of past due loans as well as loans the bank has placed on non accrual during the year 
in response to these conditions  the bank formed a special assets department in this area of the bank not only monitors loans that have been classified as non performing and or groups of loans that have been downgraded in order to enhance communications with borrowers  assist in the work out of certain credits  more closely monitor collateral  and determine the bank s exposure to such relationships 
allowance for loan losses the bank maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for probable incurred losses as of the date of the balance sheet 
the allowance is comprised of three components specific credit allocation  general portfolio allocation  and subjectively determined allocation 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to earnings and decreased by loan charge offs  net of recovered balances 
specific credit allocation the specific credit allocation of the allowance is determined through the measurement of impairment on certain loans that have been identified during each reporting period as impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when the borrower is no longer performing under the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
the bank may also consider a loan impaired when based on certain information and events surrounding a borrower  it is determined that the likelihood of the bank receiving all scheduled payments  including interest  when due is remote 
once a loan is classified as impaired  the bank places the loan under the supervision of its special assets department 
the special assets department is responsible for performing comprehensive analyses of impaired loans  including obtaining updated financial information regarding the borrower  obtaining updated appraisals on any collateral securing such loans and ultimately determining the extent to which such loans are impaired 
once the amount of impairment on specific impaired loans has been determined  the bank typically establishes a corresponding valuation allowance  which then becomes a component of the bank s specific credit allocation in the allowance for loan losses 
management s discussion and analysis general portfolio allocation for purposes of determining the general portfolio allocation of the allowance  the loan portfolio is segmented into several pools of loans  exclusive of balances individually evaluated for impairment  similar to the stratification presented in note loans  of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k 
the loan portfolio is then further segmented by an internal loan grading system that classifies loans as pass  special mention  substandard and doubtful 
estimated loss rates are then applied to each segment of the loan portfolio according to loan grade to determine the amount of the general portfolio allocation 
estimated loss rates applied are determined through an analysis of historical loss rates for each segment of the loan portfolio  based on the bank s prior experience with such loans 
subjectively determined allocation the subjectively determined allocation of the allowance is determined by estimates the bank makes in regard to certain internal and external factors that may have either a positive or negative impact on the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio 
certain of these factors include local  state and national economic and business conditions  trends in the credit quality of the loan portfolio  existence and the effects of concentrations  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  the quality of loan review as well as any other factor determined by management to possibly have an impact on the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
management periodically monitors loans in the portfolio to identify certain credits that may be impaired and or experiencing deterioration and as such  makes appropriate changes in the level of the allowance when necessary 
management employs the use of  among other things  a watch list  loan grading system  feedback provided by internal loan staff regarding specific credits  management s findings from internal loan reviews  findings and analyses provided from the bank s semi annual independent loan review function and information provided from examinations by regulatory agencies to manage credit risk and address any necessary changes in the required level of the allowance for loan losses in a timely manner 
the determination of the amount of the allowance and any corresponding increase or decrease in the level of provisions for loan losses is based on management s best estimate of the current credit quality of the loan portfolio and any probable inherent losses as of the balance sheet date 
the nature of the process in which management determines the appropriate level of the allowance involves the exercise of considerable judgment 
while management utilizes its best judgment and all available information in determining the adequacy of the allowance  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the bank s control  including but not limited to  the performance of the loan portfolio  changes in current and future economic conditions and the view of regulatory agencies regarding the level of classified assets 
continued weakness in economic conditions and any other factor that may adversely affect credit quality  result in higher levels of past due and non accruing loans  defaults  and additional loan charge offs  which may require additional provisions for loan losses in future periods and a higher balance in the bank s allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses increased in  due to several factors including a considerably weakened economy  an increase in the number of and dollar volume of past due and non performing loans  an increase in the level of charge offs when compared to prior periods and an increase in the balance of classified loans 
at december  the balance of loans the bank classified as substandard totaled approximately million compared to the million in loans classified as substandard at december  the year over year increase in substandard balances resulted in higher required balances in the general portfolio allocation under the bank s methodology for determining an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
higher charge off rates for also contributed to the higher required balances of the general portfolio allocation of the allowance 
additionally  weakened economic conditions as well as negative trends in credit quality resulted in higher required balances of the subjectively determined allocation of the allowance 
as a result of the items mentioned the bank made provisions to the allowance for loan losses in the amount of million during  compared to provisions of approximately million during as a result the allowance for loan losses at december  was approximately million compared to the million reported at december   an increase of approximately million or during management s discussion and analysis loans charged off during totaled approximately million compared to the million and million reported for and  respectively 
net charge offs to average loans for  and were    respectively 
at december  the allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans compared to the reported at december  as of december  management believes the allowance for loan losses was sufficient to cover current estimable losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
for reporting purposes  the company allocates the allowance for loan losses across product types within the loan portfolio 
however  substantially all of the allowance is available to absorb all credit losses without restriction  unless specific reserves have been established

semi annually  the loan portfolio is also reviewed by an experienced  outside loan reviewer not affiliated with the bank to augment management s own internal review of loans in the portfolio 
a list of delinquencies  the watch list  internal loan classifications and internal and external loan reviews are reviewed regularly by the bank s board of directors 
the bank has a non accrual policy that requires a loan greater than days past due and or specifically determined to be impaired to be placed on non accrual status unless such loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
when loans are placed on non accrual status  all accrued but uncollected interest income is reversed from earnings 
once on non accrual status payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest on a loan is only recognized on a cash basis and is generally not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
loans may be returned to accrual status if management believes that all remaining principal and interest is fully collectible and there has been at least six months of sustained repayment performance since the loan was placed on non accrual 
loans typically move to non accruing status from the bank s substandard risk grade 
when a loan is first classified as substandard  the bank obtains updated appraisal information on the underlying collateral 
once the updated appraisal is obtained and analyzed by management  a valuation allowance  if necessary  is established against such loan or a loss is recognized by a charge to the allowance for loan losses if management believes that the full amount of the bank s recorded investment in the loan is no longer collectible 
therefore  at the time a loan moves into non accruing status  a valuation allowance typically has already been established or balances on such loan have been charged off 
the bank orders new appraisals on underlying collateral in order to have the most current indication of fair value  if appraisals obtained while the loan was classified as substandard are deemed to be out dated 
if a complete appraisal will take a significant amount of time to complete  while waiting for an appraisal the bank may also rely on a broker s price opinion or other meaningful market data  such as comparables  in order to derive its best estimate of a property s fair value at the time the decision to classify the loan as substandard  or move the loan to non accruing status  is made 
once a loan is on non accruing status an analysis of the underlying collateral is performed at least quarterly 
if a loan s credit quality deteriorates to the point that collection of principal is believed by management to be doubtful and the value of collateral securing the obligation is sufficient  the bank generally takes steps to protect and liquidate the collateral 
any loss resulting from the difference between the loan balance and the fair market value of the collateral is recognized by a charge to the allowance for loan losses 
when collateral is held for sale after foreclosure  it is subject to a periodic appraisal 
if the appraisal indicates that the collateral will sell for less than its recorded value  the bank recognizes the loss by a charge to non interest expense 
negative undertones associated with the economy and real estate markets have resulted in the expansion of the bank s internal watch list as well as the number of and dollar volume of non accruing loans during as witnessed in the table below 
while credit quality is consistently monitored  management has implemented additional precautionary actions that include but are not limited to pro actively identifying credit weaknesses earlier in the collection cycle  increasing the oversight frequency of watch list credits and devoting additional internal resources to monitor those credits 
although the bank believes these actions will serve to potentially minimize any future losses the bank may incur related to problem loans  we cannot guarantee that the bank will not experience an increase in non performing loans  given continued uncertainties surrounding the state and national economies

at december   the balance of the investment portfolio was approximately million or million higher than that reported at december  although the values of certain securities within the portfolio declined in the face of continued market turbulence in  purchases the bank made during the year in the approximate amount of million  offset in part by principal payments  maturities  calls and sales in the aggregate amount of million  contributed to the overall increase in the balance of the portfolio 
during the bank sold approximately million in investment securities and recognized an aggregate pre tax gain of approximately thousand 
gains on the sale of investments for the years ended december  and totaled approximately thousand and thousand  respectively 
management s discussion and analysis securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with related unrealized net gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  recorded as an adjustment to equity capital 
at december  the securities portfolio had net unrealized losses  net of taxes of approximately million  substantially unchanged from that reported at december  unrealized losses in the investment portfolio in the last two years can be attributed in part to extreme market turbulence  stemming from the ongoing financial crisis and weakened economic conditions 
during and  the credit markets came under significant duress as investor and consumer confidence in the us financial system became significantly destabilized 
as a result  many financial institutions in severe need of liquidity were forced to de leverage for a variety of reasons  selling significant portions of their investment holdings which in turn placed considerable pressure on the values of many classes of investment securities 
in particular  mortgage related securities came under substantial pressure and the bank s portfolio was not completely immune to this 
although substantially all of the bank s mortgage related securities are considered investment grade  overall lack of confidence in the housing market  the inability of many consumers to meet their mortgage related obligations  and the strong need for liquidity during and have  among other things  been influential in placing pressure on the prices of these types of securities 
at december   the bank owned twelve whole loan private label mortgage backed securities pmbs with a remaining principal balance of approximately million 
pmbs do not carry a government guarantee explicit or implicit and require much more detailed due diligence in the form of pre and post purchase analysis 
all pmbs bonds were rated aaa by one or more of the major rating agencies at the time of purchase 
due to the severe and prolonged downturn in the economy pmbs bonds along with other asset classes have seen deterioration in price  credit quality  and liquidity 
rating agencies have been reassessing all ratings associated with bonds starting with lower tranche or subordinate pieces which have increased loss exposure then moving on to senior and super senior bonds which is what the bank owns with the exception of one mezzanine bond subordinate 
at december   six bonds in the approximate amount of million  have been reassessed by one or more of the rating agencies the bank must use the most recent and lowest rating when there are discrepancies between the agencies and subsequently downgraded below investment grade 
all six of these bonds are in senior or super senior tranche positions of their respective deals  meaning the bank has priority in cash flows and has subordinate tranches below its position providing credit support 
as more fully disclosed in note investments  of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k  during the fourth quarter of the company performed an analysis  with the assistance of an independent third party  on several pmbs in the investment portfolio for other than temporary impairment otti  including those mentioned in the previous paragraph 
based on this analysis  the company determined four securities with an aggregate remaining book balance of approximately million to be other than temporarily impaired 
as a result  the bank realized approximately thousand in aggregate pre tax losses related to these securities during the bank continues to perform regular extensive analyses  monthly  on pmbs bonds in the portfolio including but not limited to updates on credit enhancements  loan to values  credit scores  delinquency rates and default rates 
these investment securities continue to demonstrate cash flows as expected  based on pre purchase analyses 
as of december   management does not believe that losses on pmbs in the portfolio  other than those previously discussed  are other than temporary 
all pmbs the bank owns are in senior or super senior tranche positions of their respective deals  except for one mezzanine bond  meaning that the bank has priority in cash flows and has subordinate tranches below its position providing credit support 
the more credit support or enhancement  the more protection is provided from possible losses on non performing collateral 
credit support on pmbs the bank owns has increased from the time of purchase through december   except for one bond 
as the bank receives cash flow on its senior positions and principle is reduced quicker than default losses are applied to the subordinate positions  the credit enhancement percentage grows 
the majority of the bank s mortgage securities were issued by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae  the federal national mortgage association fannie mae  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac

at december  approximately million or of the bank s mortgage related securities were issued by a government agency such as those listed above 
all fixed and adjustable rate mortgage pools contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact upon prepayment rates 
the bank uses computer simulation models to test the average life  duration  market volatility and yield volatility of adjustable rate mortgage pools under various interest rate assumptions to monitor volatility 
stress tests are performed quarterly

as indicated in the tables above  total deposit balances at december  were approximately million 
this represents an increase of approximately million compared to the million reported at the end of the bank s focus on core deposit gathering in including the use of certain promotions  resulted in significantly higher money market  time certificate and non interest bearing demand deposits 
higher core deposit balances during has allowed the bank to rely less on wholesale funding and brokered deposits 
exclusive of pay downs in brokered funds  deposit balances increased approximately million during at december  brokered deposits totaled million  representing a decline of approximately million from that reported at december  management s focus on core deposit gathering in has significantly enhanced the bank s on balance sheet liquidity and aided the bank in bringing down the overall cost of funds  providing support for the net interest margin

management s discussion and analysis volatile deposits the table below provides a summary for deposit balances the bank considers to be volatile as of december  and percent of percent of december  total december  total dollar dollar amounts in thousands deposits deposits variance non interest bearing demand interest bearing demand savings deposits money market deposits total volatile deposits the bank monitors the balance of various accounts that it considers to be volatile for a variety of reasons and provides this data to the board of directors on a regular basis 
accounts may be added to or removed from the volatile liability dependency report when  based on management s judgment  it is determined that these funds are not suitable for any form of long term investment or that the risk associated with these funds leaving the bank has become minimal 
typically a material change in the balances of these accounts is reflected in the balance of federal funds sold 
at december   the aggregate balance of deposits the bank considers to be volatile was approximately million or million lower than that reported at december  the year to date decline in balances the bank considers to be volatile can be attributed in large part to declines in volatile interest bearing demand balances of approximately million 
the year to date decline within this category is the result of two relationships leaving the bank  the majority of which are considered public funds 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in volatile non interest bearing demand balances 
the customers that hold these deposits engage in mortgage related activities 
as more and more home owners have moved to re finance existing mortgages  given the current rate environment  deposit balances related to these customers have increased 
management and the board of directors are aware that as conditions in the market change these relationships will be impacted 
declines in the balance of volatile money market deposits can be attributed to two depositors using funds for tax payments and for investment in other asset classes 
borrowed funds the bank has a variety of sources from which it may obtain secondary funding 
these sources include  among others  the federal home loan bank fhlb and credit lines established with correspondent banks 
at december   fhlb borrowings were million or million lower than that reported at december  the year over year decline in fhlb borrowing can be attributed to the significant increase the bank saw in core deposit balances during allowing for less of a reliance on wholesale funding 
at december   the bank s remaining capacity to borrow from the fhlb was approximately million 
additionally  in september  the bank issued a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million  which has since been reduced to million  to a customer in regard to a senior care facility 
the letter of credit was issued pursuant to a letter of credit reimbursement agreement between the bank and the fhlb 
it is collateralized by a blanket lien with the fhlb that includes all qualifying loans on the bank s balance sheet 
the letter of credit will expire in september for additional information related to the bank s borrowings with the fhlb  please see note borrowings  of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k 
in october the company renewed a promissory note with pacific coast bankers bank pcbb for a revolving line of credit in the amount of million 
the note is revolving in nature for the first two years and the terms of the note call for quarterly interest only payments for the first two years with subsequent principal and interest payments for eight years on a fully amortized basis 
at december   there was no outstanding balance on this line of credit 
the company pledged  shares of the bank s stock as collateral for the line 
during the third quarter of  the company was advised that the ability to draw on the promissory note with pcbb was suspended 
the company was informed that pcbb was not suspending the company s line due to any action or circumstance surrounding the condition of the company itself  but rather pcbb was suspending all such similar lines of credit that they had issued to financial institutions due to overall uncertainty in the economic environment 
the company did not deem this to be of a material nature as the line was not used during or due to lack of use  the company did not renew the line upon its maturity in october the original two year note was executed in october and was originally obtained to assist with cash and capital needs for the acquisition of hacienda bank 
management s discussion and analysis during the bank established a credit arrangement with another correspondent bank to provide an additional source of short term liquidity

capital ratios for commercial banks in the united states are generally calculated using three different formulas 
these calculations are referred to as the leverage ratio and two risk based calculations known as tier one risk based capital ratio and the total risk based capital ratio 
these standards were developed through joint efforts of banking authorities from different countries around the world 
the standards essentially take into account the fact that different types of assets have different levels of risk associated with them 
furthermore  they take into account the off balance sheet exposures of banks when assessing capital adequacy 
management s discussion and analysis the leverage ratio calculation simply divides common stockholders equity reduced by any goodwill a bank may have by the total assets of the bank 
in the tier one risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is the total risk weighted assets of the bank 
risk weighted assets are determined by segregating all the assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio  again  uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the loan loss reserve  long term capital debt  preferred stock and other instruments 
summarized below are the company s and the bank s capital ratios at december  and regulatory standard december  december  adequately well heritage oaks heritage oaks ratio capitalized capitalized bancorp bank bancorp bank leverage ratio tier i capital to risk weighted assets total risk based capital to risk weighted assets on march  the company announced that it completed a private placement of  shares of its series b mandatorily convertible adjustable cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b preferred stock and  shares of its series c convertible perpetual preferred stock  raising gross proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  approximately million was placed in escrow for a second closing of  shares of series b preferred stock  pending receipt of regulatory approvals required for the particular investor purchasing such shares 
as discussed in note subsequent events of the consolidated financial statements  had the private placement taken place in  the company estimates tier i capital and total risk based capital for the company to have been and  respectively as of december  assuming the company down streamed million to the bank  tier i capital and total risk based capital for the bank are estimated to have been and  respectively as of december  it should be noted that these pro forma regulatory capital ratios presented are based on certain assumptions and estimates which the company believes are reasonable and do not purport to be indicative of what would have actually been presented in the company s financial statements had the private placement occurred as of the date of the balance sheet  but serve to provide management s best estimate  given all available information  of what may have been presented as of the date of the balance sheet

liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to meet the demands of depositors  investors and borrowers 
asset liquidity is primarily derived from loan payments and the maturity of other earning assets 
liquidity from liabilities is obtained primarily from the receipt of new deposits 
the bank s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the on and off balance sheet commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving the bank s financial objectives 
alco meets regularly to assess the projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual customer funding needs 
deposits generated from the bank s customers serve as the primary source of liquidity 
the bank has credit arrangements with correspondent banks that serve as a secondary liquidity source 
at december   these credit lines totaled million and the bank had no borrowings against those lines 
as previously mentioned the bank is a member of the fhlb and has collateralized borrowing capacities remaining of million at december  additionally as previously mentioned  the bank has established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve and is currently in the process of collateralizing this borrowing facility 
the bank manages liquidity by maintaining a majority of the investment portfolio in federal funds sold and other liquid investments 
most of these investments include obligations of state and political subdivisions municipal bonds and mortgage related securities that provide a relatively steady stream of cash flows 
as of december   the company believes investments in the portfolio can be liquidated at their current fair values in the event they are needed to provide liquidity 
the ratio of liquid assets not pledged for collateral and other purposes to deposits and other liabilities was at december  compared to at december  at december   the bank was within its internal guideline for liquidity 
the ratio of gross loans to deposits ltd  another key liquidity ratio  was at december  compared to at december  both of which are and were within the bank s policy guidelines 
management s discussion and analysis during and  the financial markets proved to be challenging for many financial institutions  including the bank 
as a result of these challenging market conditions  many banks experienced considerable liquidity constraints  increases in the cost of certain types of borrowing  and increased pressures on deposit pricing in efforts to retain core funding balances 
the bank did not experience any significant liquidity constraints during or however  the bank believes its significant levels of on balance sheet liquidity availability of secondary funding sources combined with its ability to re price deposits  if so needed  provides ample liquidity to continue to meet the needs of its depositors  investors and borrowers

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of interest income and interest expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
virtually all of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the banking subsidiary level 
thus  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the banking subsidiary level other than million in subordinated debentures issued by the company s subsidiary grantor trusts 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk procedures are performed at the banking subsidiary level 
the subsidiary bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within santa barbara and san luis obispo counties  of california  are subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the fundamental objective behind the management of the company s assets and liabilities is to maximize the company s economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets re price differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the company seeks to control interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
management believes historically it has effectively managed the effect of changes in interest rates on its operating results 
management believes that it can continue to manage the short term effect of interest rate changes under various interest rate scenarios 
management employs the use of an asset and liability management software that is used to measure the bank s exposure to future changes in interest rates 
this model measures the expected cash flows and re pricing of each financial asset liability separately in measuring the bank s interest sensitivity 
based on the results of this model  management believes the bank s balance sheet is asset sensitive 
the company generally expects expansion in its net interest income if rates rise and expects  conversely  contraction if rates fall 
the level of potential or expected contraction indicated by the tables below is considered acceptable by management and is compliant with the bank s alco policies 
management will continue to perform this analysis each quarter to further validate the expected results against actual data 
the hypothetical impacts of sudden interest rate movements applied to the company s asset and liability balances are modeled monthly 
the results of this movement indicate how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from various rate changes over a one year horizon 
this exercise is valuable in identifying risk exposures 
the results for the company s december  balances indicate that the net interest income at risk over a one year time horizon for a and rate increase and decrease are within the company s policy guidelines for such changes 
rate shock scenarios dollar amounts in thousands bp bp base bp bp net interest income nii change from base change from base it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitor behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the company s net interest income  therefore  the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
the following table provides a summary of the loans the bank can expect to see come off their floors if the prime rate were to increase by the amounts presented as of december  move in prime rate bps dollar amounts in thousands variable daily variable other than daily cumulative total variable at floor as evidenced in the table above  the bank can expect to see approximately million in loans come off their floors if the prime rate were to increase by basis points as of december  the company also attempts to quantify the impact of interest rate changes on borrowers ability to pay on loans and the impact of similar rate changes on the value of collateral held against loans 
to this end  the company  from time to time  will sample loans and analyze them under a rate shock scenario to specifically assess the impact of the rate shock on financial ratios such as interest rate coverage and loan to value 
the results of the analysis have generally revealed that in the case of such a rate shock  a high percentage of loans tested would continue to express ratios within current underwriting guidelines 
the results of these analyses are considered acceptable by management
