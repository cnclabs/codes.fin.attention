item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview amicus therapeutics  inc amicus is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of orally administered  small molecule drugs known as pharmacological chaperones 
pharmacological chaperones are a novel  first in class approach to treating a broad range of diseases including lysosomal storage disorders and diseases of neurodegeneration 
our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company in these areas 
our current strategic priorities include the following the phase development of our lead product candidate  amigal for fabry disease  the preclinical and clinical development of pharmacological chaperone enzyme replacement therapy combination therapy  and the preclinical evaluation of the use of pharmacological chaperones for diseases of neurodegeneration 
our novel approach to the treatment of human genetic diseases consists of using pharmacological chaperones that selectively bind to the target protein  increasing the stability of the protein and helping it fold into the correct three dimensional shape 
this allows proper trafficking of the protein within the cell  thereby increasing protein activity  improving cellular function and potentially reducing cell stress 
we have also demonstrated in preclinical studies that pharmacological chaperones can further stabilize normal  or wild type  proteins 
this stabilization could lead to a higher percentage of the target proteins folding correctly and more stably  which can increase cellular levels of that target protein and improve cellular function  making chaperones potentially applicable to a wide range of diseases 
our lead product candidate  amigal migalastat hydrochloride for fabry disease  is in phase development 
our other clinical stage product candidates are at deoxynojirimycin hcl for pompe disease  which is currently in phase testing and remains on partial clinical hold  and plicera afegostat tartrate for gaucher disease  which we do not plan to advance into phase development at this time 
we are conducting preclinical studies in diseases of neurodegeneration  including parkinson s and alzheimer s disease 
we have generated significant losses to date and expect to continue to generate losses as we continue the clinical development of our drug candidates  including amigal and conduct preclinical studies on other programs 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
from our inception in february through december   we have accumulated a deficit of million 
as we have not yet generated commercial sales revenue from any of our product candidates  our losses will continue and are likely to be substantial over the next several years and we may need to obtain additional funds to further develop our research and development programs and product candidates 
in june  we completed our initial public offering ipo of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
in connection with the closing of the ipo  all of amicus shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding at the time of the offering were automatically converted into  shares of common stock 
in march  we sold million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a select group of institutional investors 
the shares of common stock and warrants were sold in units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per unit 
the warrants have a term of four years and are exercisable any time on or after the six month anniversary of the date they were issued  at an exercise price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering are expected to be approximately million after deducting the placement agency fee and all other estimated offering expenses 
collaboration with shire pharmaceuticals ireland ltd 
shire on november   we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with shire 
under the agreement  amicus and shire were jointly developing amicus three lead pharmacological chaperone compounds for lysosomal storage disorders amigal  plicera and at we granted shire the rights to commercialize these products outside the united states us and retained all rights to our other programs and to develop and commercialize amigal  plicera and at in the us in october  the company and shire mutually agreed to terminate the collaboration agreement 
for further information  see note development and commercialization agreement with shire 

table of contents financial operations overview revenue in connection with our collaboration agreement with shire  shire paid us an initial  non refundable license fee of million and reimbursed us for certain research and development costs associated with our lead clinical development programs 
the license fee was classified as deferred revenue and was being recognized as collaboration revenue on a straight line basis over the period of the performance obligations 
we also recognized any reimbursed research and development costs as research revenue 
in october  we mutually terminated our collaboration agreement with shire and received a cash payment of million as full and final settlement of all amounts due under the collaboration agreement 
this final payment was recorded as research revenue net of a cost sharing receivable 
as a result of the termination of the agreement and as there were no further obligations under the original agreement  we recognized all previously deferred revenue as collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter of we have not generated any commercial sales revenue since our inception 
research and development expenses we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates and explore new uses for our pharmacological chaperone technology 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with our research and clinical development activities  payments we make to third party contract research organizations  contract manufacturers  investigative sites  and consultants  technology license costs  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in drug discovery and development  activities relating to regulatory filings and the advancement of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent  facility maintenance  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
we have multiple research and development projects ongoing at any one time 
we utilize our internal resources  employees and infrastructure across multiple projects 
we record and maintain information regarding external  out of pocket research and development expenses on a project specific basis 
we expense research and development costs as incurred  including payments made to date under our license agreements 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates 
from our inception in february through december   we have incurred research and development expense in the aggregate of million 

table of contents the following table summarizes our principal product development projects through december   including the related stages of development for each project  and the out of pocket  third party expenses incurred with respect to each project in thousands 
period from february  inception to years ended december  december  projects third party direct project expenses amigal fabry disease phase plicera gaucher disease phase at pompe disease phase diseases of neurodegeneration preclinical total third party direct project expenses other project costs personnel costs other costs total other project costs total research and development costs other project costs are leveraged across multiple clinical and preclinical projects 
other costs include facility  supply  overhead  and licensing costs that support multiple clinical and preclinical projects 
we do not plan to advance plicera into phase development at this time 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates 
as a result  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates  including amigal or any of our other preclinical product candidates 
this uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the conduct  duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of evolving events during clinical development  including the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patients  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the results of our clinical trials  and any mandate by the us food and drug administration fda or other regulatory authority to conduct clinical trials beyond those currently anticipated 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
we may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of that product candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
drug development may take several years and millions of dollars in development costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including stock based compensation expense  for persons serving in our executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  promotional expenses  costs associated with industry and trade shows  and professional fees for legal services  including patent related expense and accounting services 
from our inception in february through december   we spent million on general and administrative expense 

table of contents interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on our capital lease facility and our equipment financing agreement 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following discussion represents our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when amounts are realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is considered realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the amounts due are reasonably assured 
in determining the accounting for collaboration agreements  the company determines whether an arrangement involves multiple revenue generating deliverables that should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting or divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
if this division is required  the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the arrangement represents a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy and the performance obligation period must be determined if not already contractually defined for the entire arrangement 
if the arrangement represents separate units of accounting according to the separation criteria  a revenue recognition policy must be determined for each unit 
revenues for non refundable upfront license fee payments will be recognized on a straight line basis as collaboration revenue over the period of the performance obligations 
the revenue associated with reimbursements for research and development costs under collaboration agreements is included in research revenue and the costs associated with these reimbursable amounts are included in research and development expenses 
the company records these reimbursements as revenue and not as a reduction of research and development expenses as the company has the risks and rewards as the principal in the research and development activities 
since the termination of the collaboration agreement with shire in october  the company is not currently a party to any collaboration agreements 
accrued expenses when we are required to estimate accrued expenses because we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost  we identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimate the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees owed to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees owed to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees owed to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  fees owed for professional services  and unpaid salaries  wages and benefits 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value method of measuring stock based compensation  which requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of the award 
we chose the straight line attribution method for allocating compensation costs and recognized the fair value of each stock option on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards 

table of contents we recognized stock based compensation expense of million  million  and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes information related to stock compensation expense recognized in the income statement in thousands years ended december  stock compensation expense recognized in research and development expense general and administrative expense total stock compensation expense we use the black scholes option pricing model when estimating the value for stock based awards 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on a blended weighted average of historical information of our stock and the weighted average of historical information of similar public entities for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use a blended weighted average approach using our own historical volatility and other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life was determined using the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury  zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior  as well as a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows years ended december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options years expected annual dividend per share the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted during  and were  and  respectively 
prior to becoming a public company  the exercise prices for options granted were set by our board of directors  based on its determination of the fair market value of our common stock at the time of the grants with input from our management 
the members of our board of directors have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one are non employee directors 
in connection with the ipo  we performed a retrospective determination of fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock underlying stock option grants in  and through april  utilizing a combination of valuation methods that are more fully described in our form s a that was declared effective by the sec in may basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share we calculated net loss per share as a measurement of the company s performance while giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the reporting period 
we had a net loss for all periods presented  accordingly  the inclusion of common stock options and warrants would be anti dilutive 
therefore  the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share are the same 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share in thousands except share amounts years ended december  historical numerator net loss accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock net loss attributable to common stockholders denominator weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted dilutive common stock equivalents would include the dilutive effect of common stock options for common stock equivalents 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for all periods because of their anti dilutive effect 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in representing an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million associated with headcount growth prior to the work force reduction  a million increase in contract manufacturing costs due to the timing of batch production and a million increase in contract research related to clinical trials 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs related to stock compensation expense of million and an increase in rent of million related to additional office space obtained in  partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in due to the corporate restructuring implemented in the fourth quarter of this measure was intended to reduce costs and to align the company s resources with its key strategic priorities 
the restructuring charges included million for employment termination costs payable in cash and a facilities consolidation restructuring charge of million  consisting of lease payments of million related to the net present value of the net future minimum lease payments at the cease use date and the write down of the net book value of fixed assets in the vacated building of million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  an increase of million or  from million in due to assets acquired in interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million or was due to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances and the decline in interest rates 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in the increase of million or was due to the secured loan obtained in june year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in representing an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million associated with headcount growth  a million increase in research supplies and a million increase in costs for travel and meetings primarily related to clinical studies  partially offset by a reduction in contract research and manufacturing costs due to the timing of studies and manufacturing campaigns of million 

table of contents general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million associated with headcount growth and million of governance  insurance and compliance costs associated with being a public company  partially offset by a reduction in legal costs reflective of legal expenses associated with the collaboration agreement with shire

interest expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million or was due to the decrease in capital lease borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources source of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in we have funded our operations principally with million of proceeds from redeemable convertible preferred stock offerings  million of gross proceeds from our ipo in june and million from the non refundable license fee from the shire collaboration agreement in november the following table summarizes our significant funding sources as of december  approximate amount funding year no

the series a  b  c and d redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock upon the effectiveness of our ipo 
in addition  in conjunction with the shire collaboration agreement  we received reimbursement of research and development expenditures from the date of the agreement november  through year end of million 
however  we will not receive any further reimbursement payments from shire following the mutual termination of our collaboration agreement in october as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
we invest cash in excess of our immediate requirements with regard to liquidity and capital preservation in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies and money market accounts 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
although we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits  we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
in march  we sold million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a select group of institutional investors 
the shares of common stock and warrants were sold in units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per unit 
the warrants have a term of four years and are exercisable any time on or after the six month anniversary of the date they were issued  at an exercise price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering are expected to be approximately million after deducting the placement agency fee and all other estimated offering expenses

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of payments of equipment debt financing obligations of million offset by million proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants 
funding requirements we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future primarily due to research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and conducting clinical trials  and greater general and administrative expenses resulting from expanding our finance and administrative staff  adding infrastructure  and incurring additional costs related to being a public company 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials of our drug candidates  including amigal  the scope  progress  results and costs of preclinical development  laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  our ability to execute our operational and business plans and realize reductions in our expenses in line with our restructuring plan  and our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone  royalty or other payments from any such collaborators 
we do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from commercial sales for at least the next several years  if at all 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several quarters and years 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least until the second half of 
table of contents financial uncertainties related to potential future payments milestone payments we have acquired rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates through licenses granted by various parties 
while our license agreements for amigal and at do not contain milestone payment obligations  two of these agreements related to plicera do require us to make such payments if certain specified pre commercialization events occur 
upon the satisfaction of certain milestones and assuming successful development of plicera  we may be obligated  under the agreements that we have in place  to make future milestone payments aggregating up to approximately million 
however  such potential milestone payments are subject to many uncertain variables that would cause such payments  if any  to vary in size 
royalties under our license agreements  if we owe royalties on net sales for one of our products to more than one licensor  then we have the right to reduce the royalties owed to one licensor for royalties paid to another 
the amount of royalties to be offset is generally limited in each license and can vary under each agreement 
for amigal and at  we will owe royalties only to mt 
sinai school of medicine mssm 
we would expect to pay royalties to all three licensors with respect to plicera should we advance plicera to commercialization 
to date  we have not made any royalty payments on sales of our products and believe we are several years away from selling any products that would require us to make any such royalty payments 
on october   we amended and restated our license agreement with mssm 
the amended and restated agreement consolidated previous amendments into a single agreement  clarified the portion of royalties and milestone payments that we received from shire that were payable to mssm  and provided us with the sole right to control the prosecution of patent rights described in the amended and restated license agreement 
under the terms of the amended and restated license agreement  we agreed to pay mssm million in connection with the million upfront payment that we received in november  which was already accrued for at year end  and an additional million for the sole right to and control over the prosecution of patent rights 
whether we will be obligated to make milestone or royalty payments in the future is subject to the success of our product development efforts and  accordingly  is inherently uncertain 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
less than over total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations debt obligations employment agreement total fixed contractual obligations this table does not include a any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known  b any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts of such payments  timing and or the likelihood of such payments are not known  c amounts  if any  that may be committed in the future to construct additional facilities  and d contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above

on december   we entered into an employment agreement with our president and chief executive officer that provides for an annual base salary  a cash bonus of up to of base salary  an executive medical reimbursement contract  annual reimbursement up to  for medical expenses not covered by the executive medical reimbursement contract or our medical or health insurance policies  and gross up for federal and state income taxes of income tax incurred in connection with medical reimbursement 
the agreement will continue for successive one year terms until either party provides written notice of termination to the other in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
the cost of the executive medical reimbursement contract is estimated based on current premiums 

table of contents we have entered into agreements with clinical research organizations and other outside contractors who are partially responsible for conducting and monitoring our clinical trials for our drug candidates including amigal 
these contractual obligations are not reflected in the table above because we may terminate them without penalty 
we have no other lines of credit or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition related to multiple element arrangements 
this new guidance requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements based on an element s estimated selling price if vendor specific or other third party evidence of value is not available 
this guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted retrospectively from the beginning of an entity s fiscal year 
the company does not expect this will have a significant impact on the financial statements of the company 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification  which became the source of us generally accepted accounting principles to be applied to nongovernmental entities 
the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards and was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  since it is not intended to change or alter existing us gaap  this pronouncement did not have any impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events 
this guidance required application of the requirements to interim or annual financial periods ending after june  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the financial statements of the company 
at its april board meeting  the fasb issued guidance related to the reporting of financial instruments which included the following guidance on the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and new disclosure requirements 
the recognition and presentation provisions apply only to debt securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity 
extension of the fair value disclosure requirements of the fair value of all financial instruments recognized or unrecognized to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies  when practicable to do so 
these fair value disclosures must be presented together with the carrying amount of the financial instruments in a manner that clearly distinguishes between assets and liabilities and indicates how the carrying amounts relate to amounts reported on the balance sheet 
an entity must also disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments 
guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability 
the guidance listed above was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the adoption of these pronouncements did not have a material effect on the financial statements of the company and the additional disclosures required are included in the financial statements of the company for the period ended september  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates  equity prices  creditworthiness  financing  exchange rates or other factors 
our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  corporate debt securities  asset backed securities and us government agency notes with maturities of less than one year  which we believe are subject to limited interest rate and credit risk 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and  due to the short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure and consistent with our investment policy  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities and due to the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in average interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
as december   our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities were all due on demand or within one year 
our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate and therefore  we have no exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have operated primarily in the us  although we do conduct some clinical activities with vendors outside the us while most expenses are paid in us dollars  there are minimal payments made in local foreign currency 
if exchange rates undergo a change of  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
