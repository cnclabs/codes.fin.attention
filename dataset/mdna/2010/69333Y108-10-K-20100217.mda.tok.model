a summary of our financial results and our outlook are also presented 
restaurants we own and operate two restaurant concepts in the asian niche pf chang s china bistro bistro and pei wei asian diner pei wei 
on august   we sold the long lived assets of taneko japanese tavern taneko  a third restaurant concept developed in  which has been classified as a discontinued operation in the company s consolidated financial statements since the end of fiscal bistro as of january   we owned and operated full service bistro restaurants that feature a blend of high quality  traditional chinese cuisine and attentive service in a high energy contemporary bistro setting 
pf chang s was formed in early with the acquisition of the four original bistro restaurants and the hiring of an experienced management team 
utilizing a partnership management philosophy  we embarked on a strategic expansion of the concept targeted at major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
we own and operate all of our restaurants in the us with the exception of two bistro restaurants located in hawaii which are operated under a joint venture arrangement in which we own a noncontrolling interest 
additionally  two international bistro restaurants were opened in mexico city and kuwait city during the fourth quarter of fiscal under international development and licensing agreements 
pei wei as of january   we also owned and operated quick casual pei wei restaurants that serve freshly prepared  wok seared  contemporary pan asian cuisine in a relaxed  warm environment with friendly attentive 
table of contents counter service and take out flexibility 
we opened our first pei wei restaurant in july in the phoenix  arizona area and have expanded the concept significantly since that time 
we closed pei wei restaurants during the fourth quarter of and the results of these restaurants are reported within discontinued operations in our consolidated income statements for all periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
global brand development international we are selectively pursuing international expansion of our bistro restaurants 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we signed two development and licensing agreements with partners who will develop and operate bistro restaurants in international markets 
we expect these relationships to take the form of license agreements under which we would receive an initial territory fee  store opening fees and ongoing royalty revenues based on a percentage of international restaurant sales 
the first development and licensing agreement was signed with mh alshaya  the middle east s leading retailer  to develop bistro restaurants throughout the middle east over the next years 
the first restaurant opened in kuwait city during the fourth quarter of fiscal the second development and licensing agreement was signed with alsea sab de sab  the leading quick service restaurant operator in mexico  to develop bistro restaurants in mexico over the next years 
the first restaurant opened in mexico city during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  during february  we signed a development and licensing agreement with global restaurant concepts  inc  a leading casual dining operator in the philippines  to develop eight restaurants over the next five years 
the first restaurant is scheduled to open in manila during the first quarter of fiscal we continue to engage in discussions with additional potential partners regarding expansion of the bistro into various international markets 
retail in august  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with unilever to develop and launch a new premium line of frozen asian style entr es in the us  under the us chang s brand 
the new products are expected to be available in retail outlets during the first half of fiscal we will receive ongoing royalty revenues based on a percentage of product sales 
other ventures in august  we announced an agreement with frc balance llc  d b a true food kitchen  to provide debt capital for the early stage development of true food kitchen restaurants 
the agreement provides for up to a million loan facility to develop true food kitchen restaurants and can  under certain conditions  be converted by us into a majority equity position in true food kitchen 
as of january   no borrowings were outstanding under the loan facility 
our strategy our objective is to be the best operator of asian restaurants as viewed by our guests and our employees 
we aim to develop and operate a nationwide system of asian inspired restaurants that offer guests a sophisticated dining experience  create a loyal customer base that generates a high level of repeat business and provide superior returns to our investors 
to achieve our objectives  we strive to offer high quality asian cuisine in a memorable atmosphere while delivering exceptional customer service and an excellent dining value 
we are currently operating restaurants exclusively in the asian niche due in part to the continued popularity of asian cuisine  combined with a relatively lower level of organized competition in this segment compared to other popular cuisines segments such as mexican and italian 
we believe this creates a significant long term opportunity for us to both grow our existing restaurant sales and open new locations in new and existing markets 
we are selective when choosing our new restaurant locations and assess anticipated returns on invested capital at both an 
table of contents individual restaurant and market level when determining future development plans 
we seek an average unit level return on invested capital of percent for both of our concepts and plan to continue opening new restaurants to the extent that we continue to achieve our target rate of return 
our challenges our business is highly sensitive to changes in guest traffic 
increases in guest traffic drive higher sales  which improve the leverage of our fixed operating costs and thus enable us to achieve higher operating margins 
as guest traffic decreases  as it has during the past few years  lower sales result in decreased leverage that can lead to deteriorations in our operating margins 
to help offset the negative impacts of decreased leverage in a declining sales environment  our bistro and pei wei operators have undertaken a series of initiatives designed to gain efficiencies at the restaurant level  with a focus on labor and cost of sales improvement opportunities  while taking special care to ensure that these initiatives do not negatively impact our guests dining experience 
these initiatives included a focus on improved cross training  food preparation and scheduling  which created significant improvement in back of the house labor efficiencies 
the restaurant industry can be significantly affected by changes in discretionary spending patterns  economic conditions  consumer tastes  lifestyle trends and cost fluctuations 
in recent years  consumers have been under increased economic pressures and as a result  many have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
many consumers dine out less frequently than in the past or have reduced the amount they spend on meals while dining out 
accordingly  we strive to continuously evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to help maintain and enhance the strength of our brands and remain fresh and relevant to our guests while maintaining a high value to price perception 
we continuously update our menu offerings and have injected our restaurants with an updated contemporary look and feel 
we also continue to implement a number of new marketing initiatives designed to increase brand awareness and help drive guest traffic 
the restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality  price value relationships  ambiance  service and location  and many existing restaurants compete with us at each of our locations 
additionally  the continued popularity of asian cuisine may result in increased competition from new asian branded concepts as well as non asian restaurants and other food outlets  such as supermarkets  that may increase their asian inspired menu offerings 
our business is also influenced by the level of corporate travel and entertainment spending by businesses as a significant portion of our sales is generated by guests conducting business at our restaurants 
during fiscal  there was a considerable reduction in business travel and corporate spending in general  which negatively impacted our fiscal revenues and is expected to continue to have a significant effect on our results until such time as corporate spending increases 
our financial results during  we experienced continued deterioration in guest traffic at our bistro restaurants  while we saw improvement in guest traffic at our pei wei restaurants 
we achieved higher operating margins at both concepts due to labor and operational efficiencies  which contributed to higher income in fiscal our financial results include consolidated revenue growth of percent to billion  driven primarily by new restaurant openings and the benefit of an extra week in fiscal  partially offset by a decline in sales at bistro restaurants open longer than months  an increase in income from continuing operations of percent to million primarily due to operational efficiencies in cost of sales and labor and lower preopening costs  an increase in diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to pfcb of percent to due to a percent increase in income from continuing operations combined with the benefit of lower diluted shares outstanding principally resulting from share repurchases  eight new bistro openings and seven new pei wei openings 

table of contents outlook we anticipate fiscal consolidated revenues will be flat compared to fiscal this is based on our expectation of slightly lower average weekly sales at both concepts during fiscal and the impact of a week fiscal year in fiscal versus weeks in fiscal  offset by the benefit of a full year of revenues for restaurants that opened during fiscal combined with revenues from six to ten anticipated new restaurant openings during fiscal despite the impact of slightly lower anticipated average weekly sales  we expect restaurant operating margins for fiscal to be consistent with fiscal  primarily due to our expectation of favorable cost of sales offsetting the anticipated impact of deleverage of certain fixed operating costs and higher planned marketing spend 
we expect to open three to five new bistro restaurants and three to five new pei wei restaurants during fiscal as a result  we anticipate slightly lower preopening expenses for fiscal additionally  we expect to decrease interest expense and reduce diluted shares outstanding as a result of our planned paydown of outstanding credit line borrowings and additional repurchases of our common shares during fiscal we also plan to fully repay our outstanding credit line borrowings of million and repurchase approximately million in common shares under our current million share repurchase authorization during fiscal overall  we expect consolidated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to approximate for fiscal development bistro we intend to open three to five new bistro restaurants in  primarily located in existing markets 
our bistro restaurants typically range in size from  to  square feet  and require an average total cash investment of approximately million to million net of estimated tenant incentives and total invested capital of approximately million to million per restaurant net of estimated tenant incentives 
this total capitalized investment includes the capitalized lease value of the property  which can vary greatly depending on the specific trade area 
see risk factors development and construction risks 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  to  per restaurant during fiscal pei wei we intend to open three to five new pei wei restaurants in new and existing markets 
our pei wei restaurants typically range in size from  to  square feet and require an average total cash investment of approximately  to  net of estimated tenant incentives and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant net of estimated tenant incentives 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  to  per restaurant during fiscal operating statistics there are several key financial metrics that can be useful in evaluating and understanding our business 
these metrics  which are widely used throughout the restaurant industry  include short term revenue measures such as average weekly sales and total revenues and long term profitability measures such as return on invested capital  each of which are described in further detail below 
we believe it is helpful to review these measures both in total and by class year ie  year of restaurant opening 
average weekly sales represents an average sales amount per restaurant and helps gauge the changes in traffic  pricing and brand development 
new restaurants are included in our average weekly sales comparison at the start of their thirteenth month of operation 
it is not uncommon in the casual dining industry for new restaurant locations to open with an initial honeymoon period of higher than normal sales volumes and then experience a drop off in sales after initial customer trials 

table of contents total revenues by class year helps assess the sales performance of our new and existing restaurants as well as the growth of each concept as we continue our expansion strategy 
return on invested capital is a key profitability measure that provides an indication of the long term health of our concepts 
this metric is based on a comparison of operating profit to the average capital invested in our restaurants 
we believe return on invested capital is a critical indicator in evaluating our ability to create long term value for our shareholders 
the following table shows total revenues and average weekly sales for our company owned bistro and pei wei restaurants based on the year of opening revenues in thousands revenues average weekly sales year of unit opening units bistro pre total bistro pei wei pre total pei wei reflects revenues and average weekly sales for pei wei continuing operations only

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation based on fair value measurement guidance 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  for our options and cash settled liability awards  with the exception of performance units 
these assumptions include estimating expected term  common stock price volatility over the expected term and the number of awards that will ultimately not vest forfeitures 
for performance units  a monte carlo simulation model is used to calculate fair value 
the monte carlo simulation model incorporates the historical performance  volatility and correlation of our stock price and the russell index 
additionally  we use assumptions to estimate the expected forfeiture rate related to restricted stock in determining the share based compensation for these awards 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect fair value and our estimates of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of noncontrolling interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired  but at least quarterly 
an analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances 
for restaurants open greater than two years  negative restaurant level cash flows over the previous twelve month period is considered a potential impairment indicator 
in these situations  we evaluate future restaurant cash flow projections in conjunction with qualitative factors and future operating plans 
based on this assessment  we either a continue to monitor these restaurants over the near term for evidence of improved performance or b immediately recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds fair value  which is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
in the past  restaurants under monitoring have typically achieved cash flow improvements in a timely fashion such that no impairment charge was deemed necessary and the restaurant was removed from active monitoring 
however  an impairment charge was recognized during fiscal based on our decision to close ten underperforming pei wei restaurants  including several locations that were previously being monitored for impairment 
we did not recognize any impairment charges during fiscal our impairment assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and operating outcomes  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment based on our experience and knowledge 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in the economic environment  real estate market conditions and overall operating performance 
at any given time  we are actively monitoring a small number of restaurants and impairment charges could be triggered in the future if individual restaurant performance does not improve or if management decides to close that location 
also  if current economic conditions worsen  additional restaurants could be placed on active monitoring and potentially trigger impairment charges in future periods 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
on a quarterly basis  we review and update our inventory of tax positions as necessary to add any new uncertain positions taken  or to remove previously identified uncertain positions that have been adequately resolved 
additionally  uncertain positions may be re measured as warranted by changes in facts or law 
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments  including estimating the amount  timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
lease obligations we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term of the lease used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lower occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 

table of contents for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on a straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rent paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
many of our leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rent is accrued each period as the liability is incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which tenant incentives received from landlords in connection with certain operating leases for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
we have paid to our insurance carrier amounts that approximate the cost of claims known to date and we have accrued additional liabilities for our estimate of ultimate costs related to those claims 
we develop these estimates using historical experience factors to estimate the ultimate claim exposure 
our self insurance liabilities are actuarially determined and consider estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of our actual historical trends as well as historical industry data 
if actual claims experience differs from our assumptions and estimates  changes in our insurance reserves would impact the expense recorded in our consolidated income statements 
partnership structure we utilize a partnership philosophy to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of our restaurants 
historically  this philosophy was embodied in a traditional legal partnership structure  which included capital contributions from our partners in exchange for an ownership stake in the profits and losses of our restaurants 
under this legal partnership program  each partner who wished to participate in our legal partnership structure  to the extent applicable  was required to make a cash capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the partnership 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranged between two and ten percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees 
generally  no more than ten percent of an individual restaurant was owned in total by noncontrolling partners 
we performed an assessment of what the imputed fair value of these interests might be for a passive equity investor ie not someone actually working in the restaurant  utilizing a discounted cash flow model and updated assumptions based on the results of an annual valuation analysis 
this methodology involved the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments were required 
we recognized any excess of the imputed fair value of these interests  determined by using the discounted cash flow model  over the cash contribution paid by our partners as partner investment expense upon purchase by the partner of the respective interest 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the noncontrolling interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair value 
the estimated fair value of the noncontrolling interest is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows or net income of the subject restaurant or region 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments are required 
prior to fiscal year  any excess of the purchase price over the imputed fair value was recorded as an intangible asset and amortized over approximately years for our bistro restaurants and approximately years for our pei wei restaurants 
beginning in fiscal year upon the adoption of new accounting guidance  an intangible asset is no longer recognized upon buyout of noncontrolling interests 
instead  any excess of the purchase price over the imputed fair value is recognized as a reduction to additional paid in capital in equity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents effective january for new store openings  the bistro began employing a different partnership structure to achieve the same goal 
at the restaurant level  our operating and culinary partners at stores opened on or after january  still partners in the philosophical  but not legal sense no longer have a direct ownership stake in the profits and losses of a restaurant  but are instead eligible to receive monthly incentive payments based upon the profitability of the restaurant  as well as to participate in an incentive program that rewards improvements in the operating performance of the restaurant 
as a result of these changes  incentive payments made to the individuals participating in the new plan are classified as compensation expense rather than as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
accordingly  compensation expense for these operating and culinary partners is reflected in the consolidated income statement as labor expense 
additionally  a similar structure exists for our market partners  market chefs and regional vice presidents  with related compensation expense reflected as general and administrative expense in the consolidated income statement 
as a result of this change  since the beginning of  we have no longer recognized partner investment expense for new bistro restaurant openings 
additionally  many existing legal partners requested an early buyout of their partnership interests during and as a result of their desire to participate in the new plan  the financial impact of which is discussed under partner investment expense in results of operations 
the pei wei partnership structure was not affected by the changes at the bistro and the traditional partnership structure remains in effect for new pei wei restaurant openings 
results of operations we operate on a week year  with the fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to december fiscal year was comprised of weeks and fiscal years and were each comprised of weeks

revenues our revenues are derived primarily from food and beverage sales 
each segment contributed as follows bistro the increase in revenues was attributable to incremental new store revenues of million  comprised of a full year of revenues from the new stores that opened during and revenues generated by the eight new bistro restaurants that opened during the increase was partially offset by a million decline in revenues for stores that opened prior to  due to a significant reduction in overall guest traffic combined with a slight decline in the average check 
fiscal year also includes the benefit from one extra week of revenues compared to fiscal year pei wei the increase in revenues was attributable to incremental new store revenues of million  comprised of a full year of revenues from the new stores that opened during and revenues generated by the seven new pei wei restaurants that opened during the remainder of the increase was due to a million increase in revenues for stores that opened prior to  as well as a slight increase in overall guest traffic partially offset by a slight decline in the average check 
fiscal year also includes the benefit from one extra week of revenues compared to fiscal year 
table of contents costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales is comprised of the cost of food and beverages 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased at both bistro and pei wei due to the net impact of favorable product mix shifts  operational efficiencies  and favorable produce pricing 
these declines were partially offset by higher wok oil costs 
we negotiate annual pricing agreements for many of our key commodities and such contracts provided for favorable produce costs  consistent beef and seafood costs  and unfavorable poultry costs for fiscal as compared to fiscal labor labor expenses consist of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items and imputed partner bonus expense 
imputed partner bonus expense represents the portion of restaurant level operating results that is allocable to certain noncontrolling partners  but is presented as bonus expense for accounting purposes 
each segment contributed as follows bistro labor expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to improved labor efficiencies in culinary and hospitality positions and  to a lesser extent  the benefit of reduced workers compensation insurance liabilities resulting from lower than anticipated claim development 
these declines were partially offset by the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales on the portion of labor expenses that is fixed in nature and  to a lesser extent  higher management incentive and health insurance costs 
pei wei labor expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to improved labor efficiencies in culinary and hospitality positions  lower manager salaries resulting from reduced management headcount  and the benefit of reduced workers compensation insurance liabilities resulting from lower than anticipated claim development 
these declines were partially offset by higher expenses associated with the utilization of additional key hourly employees as well as the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales on the portion of labor expenses that is fixed in nature and  to a lesser extent  higher management incentive accruals 
operating operating expenses consist primarily of various restaurant level costs such as repairs and maintenance  utilities and marketing  certain of which are variable and may fluctuate with revenues 
our experience to date has been that operating costs during the first four to nine months of a newly opened restaurant are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
also  expenditures associated with marketing expenses are discretionary in nature and the timing and amount of marketing spend will vary 
each segment contributed as follows bistro operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales on the portion of operating costs that is fixed in nature  higher repairs and maintenance expense and higher menu printing costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower utilities costs resulting from favorable rates and lower usage 
pei wei operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to lower utilities costs resulting from favorable rates  lower menu printing costs and the impact of increased leverage resulting from an extra week of revenues in fiscal on the portion of operating costs that is fixed in nature 
these decreases were partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance costs and  to a lesser extent  increased marketing spend 
occupancy occupancy costs include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property and general liability insurance and property taxes 
each segment contributed as follows bistro occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues decreased from prior year primarily due to lower contingent rent expense resulting from lower sales  the impact of increased leverage resulting from an extra 
table of contents week of revenues in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  decreased general liability insurance 
these decreases were partially offset by the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales 
pei wei occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues decreased from prior year primarily due to the impact of increased leverage resulting from an extra week of revenues in fiscal and lower property tax expense partially offset by the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised of costs associated with corporate and administrative functions that support restaurant development and operations and provide infrastructure to support future growth including  but not limited to  management and staff compensation  employee benefits  travel  legal and professional fees  technology and market research 
consolidated general and administrative costs increased primarily due to higher management incentive accruals  higher share based compensation expense  principally resulting from the performance unit award grants issued to our co ceos during the first quarter of and the cash settled liability awards issued during fiscal  as well as additional compensation expense resulting from unrealized holding gains associated with investments in the k restoration plan 
these increases were partially offset by lower management salaries due to decreased headcount and a reduction in other administrative support costs 
fiscal also includes million of cash and non cash charges related to a separation agreement with the former pei wei president which included a severance payment  accelerated vesting of unvested options and the extension of the expiration date of all outstanding stock options 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of fixed assets  gains and losses on disposal of assets and the amortization of intangible assets  software and non transferable liquor license fees 
depreciation and amortization increased at both bistro and pei wei primarily due to additional depreciation on restaurants that opened during fiscal and fiscal as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization increased at both bistro and pei wei primarily due to the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales  partially offset by the impact of increased leverage resulting from an extra week of revenues in fiscal preopening expense preopening expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and are comprised principally of manager salaries  employee payroll and related training costs 
preopening expenses also include straight line rent expense for the period between the possession date of leased premises and the restaurant opening date 
each segment contributed as follows bistro preopening expense decreased primarily due to the impact of opening eight new restaurants during fiscal compared to opening new restaurants during fiscal pei wei preopening expense decreased primarily due to the impact of opening seven new restaurants during fiscal compared to opening new restaurants during fiscal partner investment expense partner investment expense represents the difference between the imputed fair value of noncontrolling interests at the time our partners invested in our restaurants and our partners cash contributions for those ownership interests 
additionally  for those interests that are bought out prior to the restaurant reaching maturity typically after five years of operation  partner investment expense includes a reversal of previously recognized expense for 
table of contents the difference between the fair value of the noncontrolling interest at inception date and the fair value at the date of repurchase  to the extent that the former is greater 
each segment contributed as follows bistro all partner investment expense activity for the bistro is related to early buyouts of noncontrolling interests 
the change in partner investment expense resulted from fewer early buyouts of noncontrolling interests during fiscal compared to fiscal pei wei partner investment expense decreased primarily due to the impact of opening fewer new restaurants during fiscal compared to fiscal interest and other income expense  net interest expense primarily consists of interest costs in excess of amounts capitalized related to our outstanding credit line and other borrowings  as well as accretion expense related to our conditional asset retirement obligations 
interest income earned primarily relates to interest bearing overnight deposits 
realized and unrealized holding gains losses related to investments in the k restoration plan are included within other income expense  with a corresponding offset in general and administrative expense 
the change in consolidated interest and other income expense  net was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of million of our outstanding credit line borrowings in fiscal additionally  unrealized holding gains during the current year compared to unrealized holding losses in the prior year associated with investments in the k restoration plan  lower capitalized interest and lower interest income contributed to the change 
we expect to continue to recognize net interest expense until such time as we further lower our outstanding debt levels or increase our development 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations  including discrete items and deduction for noncontrolling interests  was for fiscal compared to for fiscal prior fiscal year includes the impact of a change in estimate related to amended tax returns 
additionally  fiscal year state tax expense increased from fiscal year this is due to an increase in state tax filings  impacts of state tax reform measures and changes in filing methodology as a result of audits 
the income tax rate for both fiscal and fiscal differed from the expected provision for income taxes  which is derived by applying the statutory income tax rate  primarily as a result of fica tip credits 
in fiscal year  income from continuing operations increased at a greater rate than fica tip credits generated as compared to fiscal year because there are no tipped employees at pei wei  as pei wei contributes more net income  and if bistro s income from operations grows at a rate greater than revenue growth  the impact of bistro s tip credit on the company s effective tax rate will continue to decrease 
management has evaluated all positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of deferred tax assets and has determined that  with the exception of a small amount of state net operating losses  we will recognize sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax the results of taneko and closed pei wei restaurants are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during fiscal  we recognized pretax charges of million related to estimated and actual lease termination costs 
see fiscal compared to fiscal loss from discontinued operations  net of tax section for further discussion 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the portion of our net income which is attributable to the collective ownership interests of our noncontrolling partners 
in certain of our restaurants  we employ a partnership management structure whereby we have entered into a series of partnership agreements 
table of contents with our regional managers  certain of our general managers  and certain of our executive chefs

table of contents provision for income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase from the prior year was primarily attributable to state taxes  and  to a lesser extent  the impact of a change in estimate related to amended tax returns 
besides the effect of state taxes and the change in estimate related to the amended returns  the income tax rate for both fiscal and fiscal differed from the expected provision for income taxes  which is derived by applying the statutory income tax rate  primarily as a result of fica tip credits 
management has evaluated all positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of deferred tax assets and has determined that  with the exception of a small amount of state net operating losses  we will recognize sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax as part of ongoing profitability initiatives  we closed underperforming pei wei restaurants during the fourth quarter of this decision  which was reached during the third quarter of  was the result of a rigorous evaluation of our entire store portfolio 
we reviewed each location s past and present operating performance combined with projected future results 
the locations selected for closure represent restaurants with lower profitability that were not projected to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future 
during the second half of  we recognized non cash asset impairment charges of million million net of tax related to the write off of the carrying value of long lived assets associated with the pei wei store closures 
we also recognized additional pretax charges of million related to estimated and actual lease termination costs and million related to severance payments made in connection with the store closures 
these charges as well as all historical operations related to the closed stores are reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all years presented as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  as a result of the expected sale of taneko s long lived assets  taneko was classified as a discontinued operation as of december  we recognized a million million net of tax asset impairment charge which was included within discontinued operations during all revenues  costs and expenses and income taxes attributable to taneko are reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
historically  our need for capital resources has been driven by our construction of new restaurants 
more recently  our need for capital resources has also been driven by repayments of long term debt  repurchases of our common stock  and purchases of noncontrolling interests 

table of contents the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years   and in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our funding requirements since inception have been met through sales of equity securities  debt financing and cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net income for the periods shown due principally to the effect of depreciation and amortization  a net increase in operating liabilities and share based compensation expense as well as non cash asset impairment and lease termination charges 
investing activities we have historically used cash primarily to fund the development and construction of new restaurants 
investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures of million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were relatively higher during fiscal and relatively lower during fiscal due to the number of new restaurant openings in each year new restaurants during fiscal compared to new restaurants during fiscal 
also included is capitalized interest of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we intend to open three to five new bistro restaurants and three to five new pei wei restaurants in fiscal year we expect that our planned future bistro restaurants will require  on average  a total cash investment per restaurant of approximately million to million net of estimated tenant incentives 
we expect to spend approximately  to  per restaurant for preopening costs 
total cash investment per each pei wei restaurant is expected to average  to  net of estimated tenant incentives and we expect to spend approximately  to  per restaurant for preopening costs 
the anticipated total cash investment per restaurant is based on recent historical averages which have increased over prior years due to increases in construction related costs of steel  aluminum and lumber 
we expect total gross capital expenditures for fiscal to approximate million to million million to million  net of tenant incentives 
financing activities financing activities during fiscal   and included debt repayments of million  million  and million  respectively  and repurchases of common stock of million  million  and million  respectively 
financing activities also included purchases of noncontrolling interests  proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchases  distributions to noncontrolling interest partners  and the tax benefit shortfall from share based compensation  net 
fiscal also included million of credit line borrowings 
future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have historically been significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of our restaurants  the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and any potential repurchases of our common stock 
for fiscal  we believe that our cash flow from operations will significantly exceed our projected capital requirements 
as a result  we plan to continue evaluating other uses of capital  including  but not limited to  debt repayment  repurchases of our common stock and cash dividends 

table of contents in the longer term  in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we cannot ensure that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
credit facility on august   we entered into a senior credit facility credit facility with several commercial financial institutions  which allowed for borrowings of up to million 
on december   we amended the credit facility which reduced the borrowings allowed to million and modified certain restrictive language regarding restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our material existing and future domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility expires on august  and contains customary representations  warranties  and negative and affirmative covenants  including a requirement to maintain a maximum leverage ratio  as defined  of and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  of  as well as customary events of default and certain default provisions that could result in acceleration of the credit facility 
we were in compliance with these restrictions and conditions as of january  as our leverage ratio was and the fixed charge coverage ratio was as of january   we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaling million as well as million committed for the issuance of letters of credit  which is required by insurance companies for our workers compensation and general liability insurance programs 
we intend to fully repay the outstanding borrowings of million under the credit facility during fiscal available borrowings under the credit facility were million at january  see item a below for a discussion of interest rates and our interest rate swap 
share repurchase program under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors  we have repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of since july included in this total are million shares of our common stock repurchased during for million at an average price of 
the remaining million available under the company s previous share repurchase program expired in december in december  our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market or in private transactions at prevailing market prices over the next two years 
we intend to use cash on hand to repurchase shares 
we did not repurchase any shares under this authorization during fiscal we plan to repurchase approximately million of our outstanding shares of common stock under the million repurchase authorization during fiscal cash dividends based on our desire to consistently return excess cash flow to our shareholders  the board of directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly variable cash dividend 
the amount of the cash dividend will be computed based on of our quarterly net income and is expected to total approximately per share during fiscal partnership activities as of january   there were partners within our partnership system representing partnership interests 
during fiscal  we had the opportunity to purchase noncontrolling interests which had reached the five year threshold period during the year  as well as additional noncontrolling interests which i had reached the end of their initial five year term in prior years ii related to partners who left the company prior to the initial five year term or iii related to partners who requested an early buyout of their interest 
we purchased of these noncontrolling interests in their entirety for a total of million  all of which was paid in cash 

table of contents during fiscal  we will have the opportunity to purchase additional noncontrolling interests which will reach their five year anniversary 
if all of these interests are purchased  the total purchase price will approximate less than million based upon the estimated fair value of the respective interests at january  purchase commitments the following table shows our purchase commitments by category as of january  in thousands payments due by period less greater than than total year years years years long term debt operating leases capital leases purchase obligations total the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
additionally  purchase obligations have been included only to the extent that our failure to perform would result in formal recourse against us 
accordingly  certain procurement arrangements that require us to purchase future items are included  but only to the extent they include a recourse provision for our failure to purchase 
other commitments in august  we announced an agreement with frc balance llc  d b a true food kitchen  to provide debt capital for the early stage development of true food kitchen restaurants 
the agreement provides for up to a million loan facility to develop true food kitchen restaurants and can  under certain conditions  be converted by pf chang s into a majority equity position in true food kitchen 
as of january   no borrowings were outstanding under the loan facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our revolving credit facility and other borrowings as well as from changes in commodities prices 
interest rates we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our variable rate borrowings 
our revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million with outstanding amounts bearing interest at variable rates equal to libor plus an applicable margin which is subject to change based on our leverage ratio 
at january   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our credit facility as well as unsecured promissory notes totaling million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate borrowings 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on may   effectively resulting in a fixed rate on the libor component of the million notional amount 
the effective interest rate on the total 
table of contents borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was as of january  additionally  by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
we seek to minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
as of january   based on current interest rates and total borrowings outstanding  including the impact of our interest rate swap  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have an insignificant pre tax impact on our results of operations 
commodities prices we purchase certain commodities such as beef  pork  poultry  seafood and produce 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that fix the price paid for certain commodities 
historically  we have not used financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any significant commodity price increases have historically been relatively short term in nature 
cash settled awards we issued cash settled awards during fiscal  including performance units  cash settled stock appreciation rights and cash settled stock based awards 
the fair value of these awards is remeasured at each reporting period until the awards are settled and is affected by market changes in our stock price and  in the case of performance units  the relative performance of our stock price to the performance of the russell index 
fair value fluctuations are recognized as cumulative adjustments to share based compensation expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value of the cash settled awards and fair value fluctuations of cash settled awards
