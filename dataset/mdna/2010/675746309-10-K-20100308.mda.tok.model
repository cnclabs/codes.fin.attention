as described below in greater detail under recent accounting pronouncements asc  debt  we were required to retroactively apply a change to the accounting for convertible debt instruments 
this change resulted in adjustments to amounts reported for periods ended before or on dates prior to january  the following discussion of our results of operations  consolidated financial condition and capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview impact of the separation of altisource on comparisons on august   we completed the separation of altisource by distributing all of the shares of altisource common stock to ocwen shareholders and convertible noteholders of record as of august   in the form of a pro rata stock distribution 
altisource consists of the operations of our former ocwen solutions line of business and related assets comprising the mortgage services  financial services and technology products segments except for bms holdings and gss 
as a consequence of the separation and related transactions  ocwen incurred income taxes to the extent that the fair market value of altisource assets exceeded ocwen s tax basis in such assets in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
ocwen recognized  of income tax expense  of which  is current expense and  is deferred expense 
we eliminated the assets and liabilities of altisource from our consolidated balance sheet effective at the close of business on august  the following table summarizes the assets and liabilities transferred to altisource in the separation assets cash receivables goodwill and intangibles  net premises and equipment  net other assets liabilities deferred tax liability  net accrued expenses and other liabilities reduction in additional paid in capital beginning august   the operating results of altisource are no longer included in our operating results 
we do not report the historical operating results of altisource as a discontinued operation because of the significance of the continuing involvement between altisource and ocn under the long term services agreements 
the separation contributed significantly to the declines in revenues  operating expenses  income from operations and income from continuing operations 
in comparisons to our results of operations in and the summary of changes in our financial condition as of december   compared to  we focus our discussion below on additional factors  other than the separation  that affected our results of operations and or change in financial condition 
operations summary as discussed above the percent change in our consolidated operating results from to were significantly impacted by the separation of altisource from ocwen on august  in addition to the  income tax expense related to the separation  ocwen ceased  beginning on august   to record operating results from mortgage services  financial services and technology products segments except for bms holdings and gss 
the to comparative discussion below focuses primarily on changes other than those related to the separation

operating expenses in benefited from lower amortization expense on a smaller mortgage servicing rights portfolio  reduced staffing levels and fewer loan payoffs 
income from operations declined by  or in as compared to other expense  net declined dramatically due to gains on auction rate securities in compared to losses in  representing a  improvement  and a reduction in interest expense as advances and advance financing balances declined  despite higher average spreads and facility fees in compared to income from continuing operations before taxes climbed to  in from  in as subservicing and special servicing arrangements represent a larger portion of our portfolio  we expect revenues to decline 
however  we anticipate such declines to be more than offset by lower amortization and interest expense 
we incurred a significant one time tax expense associated with the separation and increased our liability for selected tax items by  representing the full amount of recognized deferred tax assets arising from deductibility of losses in a finance vehicle 
these two items contributed to a higher effective tax rate in  the deferred portion of which was non cash 
as a result  income from continuing operations declined  or in as compared to discontinued operations for includes a pre tax gain of  realized on the sale of bok 
primarily due to the tax impact of the separation and the increase in our liability for selected tax items  net income declined from to versus servicing revenues declined slightly from to due to declines in float earnings and servicing fees  offset by increases in late charges 
float earnings declined because of lower interest rates and lower average float balances which declined because of higher delinquencies and a smaller servicing portfolio 
late charges  which are not recognized as revenue until collected  increased to normal levels as delinquency rates stabilized 
operating expenses declined primarily due to significantly lower amortization expense on a smaller mortgage servicing right portfolio and fewer loan payoffs 
income from operations increased in as compared to the drastic increase in other expense  net of  from to was principally caused by unrealized fair value losses  higher financing costs and lower interest income 
income from continuing operations declined or  from to discontinued operations experienced increased losses from to of  further contributing to an overall drop in net income from to change in financial condition summary the overall decline in our assets of was principally due to the following l we implemented a strategy in the third quarter to reduce interest expense by using our cash reserves and proceeds from our equity offering to reduce advance finance borrowings 
l total advances declined by  primarily because of a decline in upb serviced combined with relatively stable loan delinquency rates and lower average advances per loan 
this decline is the net result of a  decline in match funded advances and a  increase in advances as a result of moving collateral from match funded advance facilities to a non match funded facility 
l amortization expense exceeded the fair value of acquisitions  causing a reduction in msrs 
l foreclosures  charge offs  payoffs and declines in estimated values reduced loans held for resale 
l we realized tax benefits in connection with the sale of msrs and the separation and applied tax benefits to offset our taxable earnings  all of which led to a decline in our net deferred tax assets 
l we distributed assets of  as part of the separation of altisource 
liabilities declined primarily as a result of the following items l match funded liabilities declined  reflecting both the decline in advances and our decision to use excess cash to reduce borrowings and interest expense 
l we repaid  on the investment line term note 
l servicer liabilities declined by  largely because of a decrease in the amount of borrower payments that have not yet been remitted to custodial accounts 
the decline in borrower payments is the result of slower repayments and a decline in upb serviced 
l debt securities declined by  as a result of repurchases 
during  we repurchased  par value of our convertible notes and  par value of our capital trust securities  both at a discount to par value in the open market 
l we distributed liabilities of  as part of the separation of altisource 
we increased our total equity by raising  net proceeds in a private placement in april and  net proceeds in a public equity offering in august 
in connection with the april private placement  we repurchased  worth of common stock 
liquidity summary we define liquidity as unencumbered cash balances plus unused  collateralized advance financing capacity 
following our successful capital raise in august  we implemented a strategy to deploy excess cash balances to reduce outstanding debt levels and interest expense 
at december   our cash position was  compared to  one year ago 
since we used available cash to fund advance balances  our available credit on collateralized but unused advance financing capacity was  at december  compared to zero a year ago 
our liquidity as of december  as measured by cash and available credit  increased by  or  from to excluding the investment line  which is used to finance the auction rate securities  our borrowings have decreased by  since december  the decline in borrowings of the servicing segment reflects a decline in advances and the  repayment of our msr facility  including a final payment of  on august  the decline in borrowings of the loans and residuals segment represents the early redemption of the  note on which the loans had been pledged as collateral  including a final payment of  on september  corporate items and other borrowings declined as a result of the repayments on the investment line of  and the repurchase of debt securities with a face value of  the fair value of auction rate securities was  representing securities with  total principal as of december  the remaining balance on the investment line was  we are successfully executing on our liquidation strategy 
in january and march  we settled two of our litigation actions related to auction rate securities resulting in the sale of  par value for  cash proceeds 
on february   we sold  par value of securities 
also in february  we exercised a liquidity option related to  par value of auction rate securities  resulting in a secured borrowing of  we used the majority of these proceeds to repay the investment line in full on february  at december   excluding the investment line   of our total maximum borrowing capacity remained unused  all attributable to the servicing business 
the unused borrowing capacity in the servicing business may be utilized in the future by pledging additional qualifying collateral to our facilities 
critical accounting policies our ability to measure and report our operating results and financial position is heavily influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of risks in the marketplace or other future events 
our critical accounting policies are those that relate to the estimation and measurement of these risks 
because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties  an understanding of these policies is fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the following is a summary of our more subjective and complex accounting policies as they relate to our overall business strategy 
valuation and amortization of residential mortgage servicing rights our most significant business is our servicing business 
msrs are an intangible asset representing the right to service a portfolio of mortgage loans 
we generally obtain msrs by purchasing them from the owners of the mortgage loans 
as of december   we held residential msrs with a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  we account for our residential servicing assets using the amortization method 
all newly acquired msrs are initially measured at fair value 
we amortize the balance of servicing assets or liabilities in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and assess servicing assets or liabilities for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date 
we determine estimated net servicing income using the estimated future balance of the underlying mortgage loan portfolio  which  absent new purchases  declines over time from prepayments and scheduled loan amortization 
we adjust amortization prospectively in response to changes in estimated projections of future cash flows 
we group the loans that we service into strata based on one or more of the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the risk factors used to assign loans to strata include the credit score fico of the borrower  the loan to value ratio and the default risk 
our strata include l subprime l re performing l alt a l special servicing l high loan to value l other we estimate the fair value of our msrs by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing assumptions that we believe are used by market participants 
the significant components of the estimated future cash inflows for msrs include servicing fees  late fees  prepayment penalties  float earnings and other ancillary fees 
significant cash outflows include the cost of servicing  the cost of financing servicing advances and compensating interest payments 
the most significant assumptions used in our internal valuation are the speed at which mortgages prepay and become delinquent  both of which we derive from our historical experience and available market data 
other assumptions used in our internal valuation are l cost of servicing l interest rate used for computing float earnings l discount rate l interest rate used for computing the cost of servicing advances l compensating interest expense at december   we had msrs relating to the subprime  alt a and high loan to value strata 
the following table provides the range of prepayment speed and delinquency assumptions expressed as a percentage by strata projected over the five year period beginning december  prepayment speed delinquency subprime alt a high loan to value additional assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of msrs by strata as of december  include the cost of financing advances month libor plus  float earnings month libor  a discount rate and the cost of servicing representing industry averages  which vary by strata and ranged from per year for a performing alt a loan to per year for a loan in foreclosure 
we perform an impairment analysis of our msrs by strata based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value 
to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount for any strata we recognize an impairment valuation allowance 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as summarized below l increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of our msrs as the underlying loans prepay faster which causes accelerated msr amortization  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by a lower overall cost of servicing  increased float earnings on higher float balances and lower interest expense on decreased servicing advance balances 
l increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of our msrs as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period  and the amount of servicing advances and related interest expense also increase 
l increases in the discount rate reduce the value of our msrs due to the lower overall net present value of the net cash flows 
l increases in interest rate assumptions for the cost of servicing advances will increase interest expense although this effect is partially offset because rate increases will also increase the amount of float earnings we recognize 
fair value of trading securities we recognize trading securities at fair value 
we report changes in fair value as a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
auction rate securities 
we estimated the fair value of the auction rate securities based on a combination of observable market inputs provided by actual orderly sales of similar auction rate securities and a discounted cash flow analysis 
this discounted cash flow analysis incorporates expected future cash flows based on our best estimate of market participant assumptions 
in periods of market illiquidity  the fair value of auction rate securities is determined after consideration of the credit quality of the securities held and the underlying collateral  market activity and general market conditions affecting auction rate securities 
the discounted cash flow analysis included the following range of assumptions at december  l expected term months l illiquidity premium l discount rate the expected term was based upon our best estimate of market participants expectations of future successful auctions 
the discount rate and illiquidity premium are consistent with prevailing rates for similar securities 
other significant assumptions that we considered in our analysis included the credit risk profiles of the issuers  the impact on the issuers of the increased debt service costs associated with the payment of penalty interest rates and the collateralization of the securitization trusts 
we do not assume defaults in our valuation due to the high credit quality of both the securities we hold and the underlying collateral 
as of december   auction rate securities had a fair value of  net of unrealized losses of  subsequently  in january  february and march of  we liquidated  par value of securities for  cash 
we recognized no gain or loss on these three transfers 
furthermore  we sold  par value of securities with the option to repurchase the same securities at the same sales price until october  resulting in a secured borrowing of  we used the majority of these proceeds to pay down the investment line subsequent to december  subordinates and residuals 
our subordinate and residual securities are not actively traded  and  therefore  we estimate the fair value of these securities based on the present value of expected future cash flows from the underlying mortgage pools 
we use our best estimate of the key assumptions we believe are used by market participants 
we calibrate our internally developed discounted cash flow models for trading activity when appropriate to do so in light of market liquidity levels 
key inputs include expected prepayment rates  delinquency and cumulative loss curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks 
where possible  we use observable inputs in the valuation of our securities 
however  the subordinate and residual securities in which we invest typically trade infrequently and therefore have few or no observable inputs and little price transparency 
additionally  during periods of market dislocation the observability of inputs is further reduced 
discount rates for the subordinate and residual securities range from to and are determined based upon an assessment of prevailing market conditions and prices for similar assets 
we project the delinquency  loss and prepayment assumptions based on a comparison to actual historical performance curves adjusted for prevailing market conditions 
peak delinquency assumptions range from to  and loss assumptions on current balances range from to 
average prepayment assumptions range from to 
residual and subordinate securities had a fair value of  at december   net of unrealized losses of  loans held for resale loans held for resale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value 
we account for the excess of cost over fair value as a valuation allowance with changes in the valuation allowance included in gain loss on loans held for resale  net  in the period in which the change occurs 
all loans held for resale were measured at fair value because the cost of  exceeded the estimated fair value of  at december  when we enter into an agreement to sell a loan to an investor at a set price  the loan is valued at the commitment price 
the fair value of loans for which we do not have a firm commitment to sell is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
we stratify our fair value estimate of uncommitted loans held for resale based upon the delinquency status of the loans 
we base the fair value of our performing loans on the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk of the estimated cash flows 
significant assumptions include collateral and loan characteristics  prevailing market conditions and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
the fair value of our non performing loans is determined based upon the underlying collateral of the loan and the estimated period and cost of disposition 
deferred tax assets the use of estimates and the application of judgment are involved in the determination of our overall tax provision and the evaluation of the realizability of our gross deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of  and gross deferred tax liabilities of resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  we increased our liability for selected tax items by  representing the full amount of recognized deferred tax assets arising from deductibility of losses in a finance vehicle 
we conduct periodic evaluations of positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset can be realized in future periods 
among the factors considered in this evaluation are estimates of future taxable income  future reversals of temporary differences  tax character ordinary versus capital and the impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented  if warranted 
we assess the amount of the valuation allowance each quarter 
litigation we monitor our litigation matters  including advice from external legal counsel  and regularly perform assessments of these matters for potential loss accrual and disclosure 
we establish reserves for settlements  judgments on appeal and filed and or threatened claims for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated

includes  in   in and  in of interest income from auction rate securities 
the following table provides information regarding the changes in our portfolio of residential assets serviced amount of upb count servicing portfolio at beginning of year additions runoff servicing portfolio at end of year versus servicing and subservicing fees declined due to the decline in the average upb of residential assets serviced and lower modifications in due to the implementation of hamp 
compliance with hamp borrower documentation requirements caused loan modifications that would ordinarily have been completed in to be delayed 
lower average custodial account balances  due to lower upb and reduced loan payoff collections  and lower interest rates also contributed to the overall decline in total revenues 
as subservicing and special servicing arrangements represent a larger portion of our portfolio  we expect revenues to decline 
however  we anticipate such declines to be more than offset by lower amortization and interest expense 
we estimate that during the balance of uncollected and unrecognized servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments increased by  to  as of december  operating expenses benefited from lower msr amortization expense  reduced staffing levels and lower servicing and origination expense 
amortization expense declined in as the projected average prepayment speed cpr fell and we shifted our portfolio composition to more subservicing arrangements  leading to a lower average msr balance in  as compared to our efforts to reduce staffing levels resulted in a decline in compensation and benefits expense as we reduced our average us headcount and maintained our india staffing level 
approximately two thirds of the decline in average us employment was due to our decision in july not to renew our contract with the va 
servicing and origination expense declined as a result of a decline in voluntary loan payoffs 
the delinquency rate remained relatively stable in total advances have continued to decline in  however  the effects of implementing hamp slowed the rate of decline 
lower upb and increased sales of foreclosed real estate also contributed to the decline in advances 
we expect delinquency rates to remain flat or decline somewhat in  which will lead to further reductions in advances as our seasoned portfolio matures 
prepayment speed was lower in primarily due to a decline in loan payoffs partly offset by an increase in real estate sales 
real estate sales and other involuntary liquidations accounted for approximately of prepayments during as compared to approximately for we completed  modifications in as compared to  in in  of completed modifications were hamp and the remaining non hamp 
the split between hamp and non hamp modifications is to be expected since the earliest period in which completed hamp modifications could occur was the third quarter 
we completed  modifications in the fourth quarter of  of which  were hamp and  were non hamp 
the number of completed modifications in the fourth quarter of was higher than the  modifications completed in the third quarter of completed modifications were lower in the second and third quarters of than in prior quarters because of the challenges imposed by the need to collect the requisite documentation from borrowers and make the changes in our work streams necessitated by the hamp program 
hamp modification offers were extended to  borrowers in interest expense in was lower than in principally because of the decline in match funded advances coupled with our strategy of reducing advance financing through the use of cash reserves and the proceeds of our equity offering 
at december   of match funded advances were funded through borrowings as compared to at december  although the majority of our credit facilities bear interest at rates that are adjusted regularly based on month libor  our average effective interest rate for did not decline in proportion to the decline in libor 
this is principally the result of the higher spreads over libor charged on the new match funded facilities that we added in and and higher facility fees charged by the lenders on the new facilities and on the renewal of existing facilities regardless of the amount of borrowing 
the following table shows selected assets and liabilities of our servicing segment as of december advances match funded advances mortgage servicing rights residential receivables debt service accounts other total assets match funded liabilities lines of credit and other secured borrowings servicer liabilities other total liabilities includes  due in connection with a loan subservicing agreement for reimbursable advances  the majority of which we have collected subsequent to december  represents amounts collected  primarily from residential borrowers whose loans we service  which we will deposit in custodial accounts  pay directly to an investment trust or refund to borrowers 
the primary factor in the decline from is low collection volume resulting from slower voluntary prepayments and a smaller servicing portfolio 
versus servicing was our most profitable segment in  despite absorbing the negative impact  first  of higher delinquencies  as compared to  and lower float balances and  second  of increased interest expense that resulted from our need to finance higher servicing advance balances 
servicing and subservicing fees declined due to the decline in the average upb of residential assets serviced and lower float earnings attributable to lower average custodial account balances and lower interest rates 
the decline in the average custodial account balance is the result of the decline in the average upb of residential assets serviced and lower collections related to loan payoffs 
however  process management fees  revenues associated with foreclosed residential and real estate marketing activities  increased in reflecting more effective marketing and pricing related to foreclosed residential real estate 
this increase was partially offset by declines in both the number of properties sold and the average price 
total revenues also benefited from the increase in late charges for  due to higher delinquencies and higher collections of previously assessed late charges 
we estimate that during the balance of uncollected and unrecognized servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments increased by to  as of december  operating expenses benefited from lower msr amortization expense and lower servicing and origination expense  partially offset by increased technology and communication expenses 
amortization expense declined in due to a decrease in projected average prepayment speed  leading to a lower average msr balance in  as compared to slower projected mortgage prepayment speeds and higher projected delinquencies have reduced the rate of amortization as we expect to earn the servicing income over a longer period of time 
servicing and origination expense declined as a result of a decline in voluntary loan payoffs  system automation and process improvements 
the increase in technology and communication expense in is due to higher technology support charges from the former technology products segment  now part of altisource 
the higher charges principally reflect the implementation of a market based rate card in the second quarter of that replaced the cost based method used in all prior periods 
due to lower operating expenses  income from operations improved by  or in as compared to delinquencies were relatively stable and advances declined during this is due to both a decline in the upb of residential assets serviced and to our success in stabilizing the delinquency rate of these loans 
management initiatives designed to maximize the return to the loan investors resulted in increased loan modifications and faster sales of foreclosed real estate and were the primary factor in stabilizing delinquencies 
prepayment speed increased in due to a larger number of real estate sales 
such involuntary liquidations accounted for approximately of prepayments during as compared to approximately for interest expense increased in principally because of increased financing costs associated with the growth in residential servicing advances 
in  we also experienced an increase in facility fees and in interest rates spreads charged by the lenders 
although the majority of our credit facilities bear interest at rates that are adjusted regularly based on month libor  our average effective interest rate for did not decline in proportion to the decline in libor 
this is principally the result of the higher spreads over libor charged on the new match funded facilities that we added in and higher facility fees charged by the lenders on the new facilities and on the renewal of existing facilities

versus operating expenses increased primarily due to higher professional service fees 
in  we incurred  of expenses related to strategic initiatives including  in connection with the going private transaction which the parties mutually terminated in march the decline in interest income is principally due to a decline in the average balance of our investment in short term investment grade securities including cmos and commercial paper 
similarly  the decline in interest expense is due to repurchases of our debt securities during the unrealized losses on auction rate securities in were principally determined based on extremely constrained collateral and credit markets and the failure of the auction markets supporting these securities 
in august  we redeemed our investment in certificates of deposit prior to their maturity in order to meet an unanticipated liquidity need 
the cash received from the issuer upon redemption was less than the adjusted cost basis of the certificates of deposit resulting in a loss of  equity total equity increased due to the net proceeds of  from the public offering of  shares of common stock in august and proceeds of  from the private placement of  shares of common stock in april the exercise of stock options and the compensation related to employee share based awards along with net income of also contributed to the increase in equity in offsetting these increases were the distribution of  of net assets in connection with the separation and the repurchase of  shares of common stock for  non controlling interests of and at december  and december   respectively  primarily represented the investment in gss held by ml ibk positions  inc with our adoption on january  of the new accounting guidance related to non controlling interests  we reclassified non controlling interest from a separate classification in our consolidated balance sheets to classification as a component of equity

our effective tax rate for includes a benefit of approximately associated with the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets and associated with certain provision to return reconciling items recognized in the fourth quarter 
these reconciling items are a result of certain estimates we used in our year end tax provision for which we obtained additional information as part of the tax return preparation process 
liquidity and capital resources we define liquidity as unencumbered cash balances plus unused  collateralized advance financing capacity 
our liquidity as of december  as measured by cash and available credit  increased by  or  from to at december   our cash position was  compared to  one year ago 
our available credit on collateralized but unused advance financing capacity was  at december  compared to zero a year ago 
we used available cash to fund advance balances  as part of our debt and interest expense reduction strategy more fully described below 
we also distributed  of cash in connection with the separation and made income tax payments of  investment policy and funding strategy 
our primary sources of funds for near term liquidity are l match funded liabilities l payments received on loans held for resale l lines of credit and other secured borrowings l payments received on trading securities l servicing fees  including float earnings l debt securities in addition to these near term sources  additional long term sources of liquidity include debt securities and equity capital 
our primary uses of funds are the funding of servicing advances  the payment of interest and operating expenses  the purchase of servicing rights and the repayment of borrowings 
we closely monitor our liquidity position and ongoing funding requirements 
our investment policies emphasize principal preservation by limiting investments to include l securities issued by the us government  a us agency or a us government sponsored enterprise l money market mutual funds l money market demand deposits currently  we are primarily invested in money market demand deposits 
furthermore  our investment policies are intended to minimize credit and counterparty risk by establishing risk limits based on each counterparty s equity size and long term credit ratings 
we regularly monitor and project cash flow timing in connection with our efforts to optimize the risk adjusted yield of our portfolio of investments 
during the global financial crises of and  we made preservation of capital and expansion of advance financing capacity our top priorities in order to ensure we could meet our liquidity and operating needs 
in august  we implemented a strategy to deploy excess cash balances to reduce outstanding debt levels and interest expense 
we also began to execute on a strategy to increase the duration of our advance financing 
as part of this strategy  we issued multi year fixed rate notes under the term asset loan facility talf program administered by the federal reserve bank of new york and created a new advance facility structure which allows for multiple notes with staggering maturity dates to reduce roll over risk 
outlook 
in  we expect to reduce up front facility fees and execute at tighter spreads over libor and commercial paper rates 
while we expect to benefit from the fixed interest rates on our  december and  february talf notes  these rates are currently higher than libor and commercial paper as of december  we also expect to benefit from the increase in the duration of our funding sources 
our recent talf issuances of  in december and  in february increased the maturity for of our advance financing needs at fixed interest rates 
following the repayment of the investment line in full in february and the transfers of auction rate securities for cash proceeds  we continue our efforts to release cash by liquidating the remaining auction rate securities with a fair value of  and par value of  we expect to complete this in debt financing summary 
during  we reduced our outstanding liabilities by l repurchasing convertible notes with a face value of  l repurchasing capital trust securities with a face value of  l repaying our  msr financing facility  l repaying  on our auction rate securities investment line  and l repaying our class a notes  representing financing of our loans held for resale 
despite a credit environment that remains challenged  during we l renewed a  advance note  l obtained  in new term advance financing  l renewed our investment line in support of the auction rate securities through june   l increased the maximum borrowing capacity of a  advance financing facility to  l issued a new variable funding note with a maximum borrowing capacity of  and l issued  of advance receivable backed notes under the talf program 
as a result of our ability to renew and increase advance facility notes before they entered their amortization period and to issue the talf notes  maximum borrowing capacity for match funded advances increased by  from  at december  to  at december  when coupled with a reduction in advances and match funded advances of  we increased our unused advance borrowing capacity from  at december  to  at december  our prospects for advance financing have improved due to the inclusion of servicer advances in talf which was announced by the federal reserve bank of new york in on march  talf allows lenders to invest a relatively small amount of equity while borrowing the remainder from the federal reserve bank at a modest spread over libor  with a note term of up to three years for servicer advances 
on december   we issued  of talf notes to replace the  term advance note that we repaid on august  the talf note enters its amortization period in july the amortization date is the date on which the revolving period ends under each advance facility note and repayment of the outstanding balance must begin if the note is not renewed or extended 
the maturity date is the date on which all outstanding balances must be repaid 
in all but one advance facility  there is a single note outstanding 
for each of these facilities  after the amortization date  all collections that represent the repayment of advances pledged to the facility must be applied to reduce the balance of the note outstanding  and any new advances are ineligible to be financed 
in order for us to maintain liquidity and the ability to finance new advances  we repay borrowings under facilities that have entered their amortization period and pledge them to another facility 
our new advance facility structure  which has four notes outstanding as of february  permits collateral to be apportioned between notes when one or more notes are in amortization 
this feature permits us to continue to finance new advances provided there is sufficient capacity on other revolving notes in the structure that are not in amortization 
in the table below  we provide the amortization dates and maturity dates for notes under each of our credit facilities as of december   excluding the investment line

with respect to our match funded facilities  all eligible advances had been pledged to a facility at december  however  we had  of unused borrowing capacity readily available to us on december  because we had pledged collateral to  but fully drawn on  our facilities 
on december   we issued  of notes under the talf program 
these notes carry a fixed rate of interest and enter their amortization period in july in addition  we issued two variable funding notes 
one note with a maximum borrowing capacity of  enters its amortization period in february the second note has a maximum borrowing capacity of  however  the purchaser had no obligation to fund any borrowing under the note until january  at which time the maximum funding obligation was  the maximum funding obligation under this note increases to  in november and to  in november effective december   we reduced the maximum borrowing capacity from  to  we extended this note through march  the fee reimbursement advance is payable annually in five installments of  the advance does not carry a stated rate of interest 
however  we are compensating the lender for the advance of funds by forgoing payment of fees due from the lender over the five year term of the advance 
accordingly  we recorded the advance as a zero coupon bond issued at an initial implied discount of  on january   we repurchased  face amount of our capital trust securities for a gain of our ability to finance servicing advances continues to be a significant factor that affects our liquidity 
three of our match funded advance facilities that are rated are subject to increases in the financing discount if deemed necessary by the rating agency in order to maintain the minimum rating required for the facility 
while several rating agencies have adjusted their methodology for rating servicer advances and advance rates for newly issued notes are somewhat lower than in the past  we do not expect future advance rate changes to have a material effect on our liquidity 
our ability to continue to pledge collateral under each advance facility depends on the performance of the collateral 
currently  the majority of our collateral qualifies for financing under the advance facility to which it is pledged 
some of our existing debt covenants limit our ability to incur additional debt in relation to our equity  require that we do not exceed maximum levels of delinquent loans and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquid assets and earnings 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in restrictions on new borrowings or the early termination of our borrowing facilities 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants and do not expect them to restrict our activities 
equity financing summary

in early  we suffered a significant adverse liquidity event when the auction markets failed for our  investment in aaa rated securities backed by securitized federal family education loan program student loans 
we financed this investment in auction rate securities through the investment line 
with the failure of the auction markets for these securities  we were unable to sell our investment because the market mechanism no longer functioned 
at december   the fair value of this investment was  representing  par value securities  and the remaining balance on the investment line was  we are successfully executing on our liquidation strategy 
l on january  and march   we settled two of our litigation actions related to auction rate securities resulting in the sale of a combined  par value for  cash proceeds 
proceeds from one settlement were used to pay down the investment line 
l on february   we sold  par value of securities for cash proceeds of  these proceeds were used to pay down the investment line 
l on february   we sold  par value of auction rate securities with the option to repurchase the same securities at the same sales price until october  resulting in a secured borrowing of  under this option  we sold the securities at the strike price  but we retain the ability to benefit from future increases in the value of the securities above the strike price over the term of the option 
we used these proceeds to repay the investment line

except for a guarantee by ols of payment by one of the spes  holders of the notes issued by the spes have no recourse against any assets other than the match funded advances that serve as collateral for the securitized debt

at december   the debt outstanding under that facility was  actual interest on match funded liabilities was  in future interest may vary depending on utilization and changes in libor and spreads 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we engage in transactions with a variety of financial institutions and other companies that are not reflected on our balance sheet 
in addition  through our investment in subordinate and residual securities  we provide credit support to the senior classes of securities 
we are subject to potential financial loss if the counterparties to our off balance sheet transactions are unable to complete an agreed upon transaction 
we seek to limit counterparty risk through financial analysis  dollar limits and other monitoring procedures 
we have also entered into non cancelable operating leases and have committed to invest up to an additional  in onl and related entities 
derivatives 
we record all derivative transactions at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
we use these derivatives primarily to manage our interest rate risk 
the notional amounts of our derivative contracts do not reflect our exposure to credit loss 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivatives 
involvement with spes 
we use spes for a variety of purposes but principally in the financing of our servicing advances and in the securitization of mortgage loans 
our securitizations of mortgage loans were structured as sales 
the spes to which we have transferred the mortgage loans are qualifying special purpose entities qspes and therefore have not been subject to consolidation through we have retained both subordinated and residual interests in these qspes 
where we are the servicer of the securitized loans  we generally have the right to repurchase the mortgage loans from the qspe when the costs exceed the benefits of servicing the remaining loans 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding accounting changes that eliminated the qspe concept effective january  we generally use match funded securitization facilities to finance our servicing advances 
the spes to which the advances are transferred in the securitization transaction are included in our consolidated financial statements either because the transfer did not qualify for sales accounting treatment or because the spe is not a qspe  and we have the majority equity interest in the spe  or we are the primary beneficiary where the spe is also a vie 
the holders of the debt of these spes can look only to the assets of the spes for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against ocn 
however  ols has guaranteed the payment of the obligations of the issuer under a match funded facility that closed in april the maximum amount payable under the guarantee is limited to of the notes outstanding at the end of the facility s revolving period 
vies 
in addition to certain of our financing spes  we have invested in several other vies primarily in connection with purchases of whole loans 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we report the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments recent accounting pronouncements listed below are recent accounting pronouncements which did or are expected to have a significant impact upon adoption 
for additional information regarding these and other recent accounting pronouncements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
asc  transfers and servicing 
this statement clarifies that the objective of the standard is to determine whether a transferor and all of the entities included in the transferor s financial statements being presented have surrendered control over transferred financial assets 
that determination must consider the transferor s continuing involvements in the transferred financial asset  including all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with  or in contemplation of  the transfer  even if they were not entered into at the time of the transfer 
this statement modifies the financial components approach currently used and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset  or portion of a financial asset  should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements being presented and or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset 
this statement defines the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
if the transfer does not meet those conditions  a transferor should account for the transfer as a sale only if it transfers an entire financial asset or a group of entire financial assets and surrenders control over the entire transferred asset s 
this statement requires that a transferor recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained including a transferor s beneficial interest and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
enhanced disclosures are required to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
the provisions for guaranteed mortgage securitizations are removed to require those securitizations to be treated the same as any other transfer of financial assets within the scope of the standard 
if such a transfer does not meet the requirements for sale accounting  the securitized mortgage loans should continue to be classified as loans in the transferor s statement of financial position 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard upon adoption effective january  asc  consolidation 
this standard requires an enterprise to perform ongoing periodic assessments to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
we adopted this standard effective january  this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics a the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
in addition to reintroducing the concept of control into the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie  this statement makes numerous other amendments to the current standards to primarily reflect the elimination of the concept of a qspe under asc above 
this statement also amends the current standards to require enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
the enhanced disclosures are required for any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a vie 
the additional disclosures required by this statement are included in note principles of consolidation 
this standard became effective as of january  as disclosed in note securitizations of residential mortgage loans  we currently exclude certain loan securitization trusts from our consolidated financial statements because each is a qspe 
effective january   we are required to reevaluate these qspes as well as all other potentially significant interests in other unconsolidated entities  such as our asset management vehicles and the securitization trusts underlying our servicing portfolio  to determine if we should include them in our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new standard  in connection with the new guidance issued under asc above 
asc  debt 
the fasb issued fsp no 
apb codified within asc providing guidance on convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
under this guidance  issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
upon adoption of this standard on january   we recognized a discount to reduce the carrying value of the convertible notes and an offsetting increase to stockholders equity 
the cumulative effect of adoption resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of  due to the retrospective accretion of the resulting debt discount to interest expense over the expected life of the notes  adjustments to debt issue cost amortization and gains or losses recognized on previous redemptions  and an increase in additional paid in capital of  the adjustment to additional paid in capital includes the recognized debt discount  adjusted for note redemptions  and the effect of deferred taxes  as well as net gains or losses attributable to redemptions of the equity component 
interest expense for the years ended december  and have been adjusted to include amortization of debt discount of  and  respectively  and a reduction in the amortization of debt issue costs of and  respectively 
the gain previously recognized on the redemption of debt securities during of  has been adjusted to reflect a loss of on the debt component of the convertible notes in the statement of operations and a gain of  in additional paid in capital for the equity component

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands market risk includes liquidity risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
market risk also reflects the risk of declines in the valuation of financial instruments and the collateral underlying loans 
our investment committee reviews significant transactions that may impact market risk and is authorized to utilize a wide variety of techniques and strategies to manage market risk including  in particular  interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
liquidity risk we are exposed to liquidity risk primarily because of the cash requirements to support the servicing business including the requirement to make advances pursuant to servicing contracts and the process of remitting borrower payments to the custodial accounts 
in general  we finance our operations through operating cash flows and various other sources of funding including match funded agreements and secured lines of credit 
on april   we were successful in negotiating a one year extension of the investment line to june  however  because of the failed auctions  the market for auction rate securities is currently not liquid 
in the event we need to liquidate our investment  we may not be able to do so without a loss of principal 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds  or different bases  than our interest earning assets or when we use debt to finance assets that are non interest earning 
our servicing business is characterized by non interest earning assets financed by interest bearing liabilities 
among the more significant non interest earning assets are servicing advances and msrs 
at december   we had total advances and match funded advances of  we are indirectly exposed to interest risk by our funding of advances because approximately of our total advances and match funded advances are funded through borrowings  most of which are variable rate debt 
earnings on float balances assets partially offset this risk 
following our successful equity capital raise in august  we implemented a strategy to deploy excess cash balances to reduce outstanding debt levels and interest expense 
we significantly reduced our ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities from to this reduction helps to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
in  we expect to reduce up front facility fees and execute at tighter spreads over libor and commercial paper rates 
we also expect to benefit from the increase in the duration of our funding sources 
our recent term asset loan facility talf issuances of  in december and  in february increased the maturity for of our advance financing needs at fixed interest rates 
the tables below present the notional amounts of our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates categorized by expected maturity and the related fair value of these instruments at december  and we use certain assumptions to estimate the expected maturity and fair value of these instruments 
we base expected maturities upon contractual maturity and projected repayments and prepayments of principal based on our historical experience 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from our historical experience

foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our investment in non us dollar functional currency operations to the extent that our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged
