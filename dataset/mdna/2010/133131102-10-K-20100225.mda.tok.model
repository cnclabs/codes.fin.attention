table of contents executive summary during and  a number of factors adversely affecting the demand for and rents received by our multifamily communities were intense and pervasive across the united states  and the conditions within the multifamily industry have become progressively more challenging 
a prolonged recession  high inventory levels of single family homes and condominiums in the markets in which we operate  overall weak consumer confidence  and high unemployment  among other factors  have persisted and  in some cases  accelerated in we believe the effects of these factors on the multifamily industry have been further magnified by high levels of home foreclosures  liquidity disruptions in the financial markets  continued job losses  and lack of job growth 
our average apartment lease term is approximately twelve months 
the impact of an economic downturn affects us quickly due to the short term nature of our leases because our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 
based on these market conditions and our belief these conditions will continue in the near future  we are cautious regarding expected performance and expect a decline in property revenues during as compared to however  positive impacts on our performance may result from reductions in the us home ownership rate  more stringent lending criteria for prospective home buyers  and long term growth prospects for population  employment  and household formations in our markets  although there can be no assurance any of these factors will develop  continue or positively impact our operating results 
we have noted a recent increase in issuances of debt and equity by reits at more attractive rates 
while this may be a positive sign  we are uncertain if this level of activity will increase or continue 
during the near term  we plan to continue to primarily focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations  reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios  and controlling and reducing overhead costs 
we review our long lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our impairment evaluations take into consideration the current and anticipated economic climate 
based on our evaluations  we recorded significant impairment charges in the fourth quarter of for land holdings for eight future projects and a land development joint venture we have put on hold for the foreseeable future 
we currently have five wholly owned land parcels held for future development we plan to develop 
however  the commencement of future developments may continue to be impacted by macroeconomic issues  multifamily market conditions  and other factors 
we will continue to evaluate future development starts based on market  economic and capital market conditions 
however  if current conditions persist  there can be no assurance we will not have further impairments in the future 
subject to market conditions  we intend to continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of our funds 
until the earlier of i december  or ii such time as of their committed capital is invested  subject to two one year extensions  the funds will be our exclusive investment vehicles for acquiring fully developed multifamily properties  subject to certain exceptions

table of contents funds from operations ffo management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including certain noncontrolling interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 
reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december are as follows in thousands funds from operations net income loss attributable to common shareholders real estate depreciation and amortization  including discontinued operations adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of properties  including land and discontinued operations  net of taxes income loss allocated to noncontrolling interests funds from operations diluted weighted average shares basic incremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of common share options and share awards granted common units weighted average shares diluted includes an million  million and million impairment associated with land development activities for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility  which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available 
we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt  maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios  and using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and common and preferred equity 

table of contents our interest expense coverage ratio  net of capitalized interest  was approximately   and times for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our interest expense coverage ratio is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses  non property income  other expenses  income from discontinued operations  depreciation  amortization  and interest expense 
at december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered 
our weighted average maturity of debt  including our line of credit  was years at december  due to the instability experienced during the current economic downturn  we believe the timing and strength of an economic recovery is unclear and these conditions may not improve quickly 
we plan to continue to primarily focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations  reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios  selectively disposing of properties when feasible  and controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
other sources include the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowings  secured mortgage debt  proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments  and access to the capital markets 
we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during including normal recurring operating expenses  current debt service requirements  recurring capital expenditures  initial funding of property developments  acquisitions  joint venture investments  and notes receivable  and the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code 
factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to current volatility in capital and credit markets  sources of financing  our ability to complete asset sales  the effect our debt level and decreases in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets  and changes in operating costs resulting from a weakened economy  all of which could adversely impact occupancy and rental rates and our liquidity 
cash flows certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  and repurchases of debt and common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon  among other factors  market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to approximately during the year ended december  the slight increase was primarily due to lower interest expense offset by lower net operating income in as compared to  and the timing of payments relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  totaled approximately million as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  cash outflows for property development  acquisition  and capital improvements were approximately million during as compared to approximately million during this decrease was due to the timing of completions of communities in our development pipeline and a reduction in construction and development activity in as compared to cash inflows from sales of properties and partial sales of assets to joint ventures were approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  additionally  cash outflows for investments in joint ventures were million for the year ended december  as compared to million in  this increase in cash outflows was primarily a result of our million equity investment in one of our joint ventures during the third quarter 
table of contents net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million during during the year ended december   we used a total of approximately million of cash to repay outstanding notes payable consisting of approximately million of outstanding notes payable stemming from our april tender offer  the early retirement of outstanding debt consisting of approximately million of secured notes  and approximately million of senior unsecured notes 
the remaining outstanding notes payable payments were primarily for maturing secured and unsecured notes payable of approximately million  and payments of all remaining amounts outstanding on our unsecured line of credit 
also in  million was used for distributions paid to common shareholders  perpetual preferred unit holders  and noncontrolling interest holders 
the cash outflows were offset by cash receipts of million from a secured credit facility entered into during the second quarter  approximately million from secured notes payable relating to a construction loan for a consolidated joint venture and net proceeds of approximately million from the completion of our equity offering in may in  we used million of cash in financing activities primarily to repay approximately million of outstanding notes payable consisting of approximately million of outstanding notes payable in our december tender offer  approximately million of various series of other outstanding debt  and approximately million of maturing secured notes payable 
net cash used in financing activities for was also attributable to distributions paid to common shareholders  perpetual preferred unit holders  and noncontrolling interest holders of approximately million and approximately million of common share repurchases  offset by proceeds from notes payable and increases in our unsecured line of credit of approximately million and million  respectively 
financial flexibility we have a million unsecured credit facility which matures in january the scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change 
advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates  or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates 
these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations  all of which we are in compliance 
our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit 
while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line  it does reduce the amount available 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  and had approximately million available under our unsecured line of credit 
as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit  from time to time we may borrow using competitively bid unsecured short term notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group 
we expect such borrowings  if any  will vary in term and pricing and will typically be priced at interest rates below those available from the unsecured line of credit 
during the quarter ended june   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which became automatically effective upon filing and allows us to offer  from time to time  an unlimited amount of common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  or warrants 
our declaration of trust provides we may issue up to million shares of beneficial interest  consisting of million common shares and million preferred shares 
during the quarter ended june   we issued approximately million common shares at per share in a public equity offering  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately million common shares and no preferred shares outstanding 
we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody s and standard and poor s  which are currently baa and bbb  respectively  with stable outlooks  as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from fannie mae or freddie mac 
however  we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing continued volatility and disruption 
we have noted a recent increase in issuances of debt and equity by reits at more attractive rates 
while this may be a positive sign  we are uncertain if this level of activity will increase or continue 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents on april   we  as guarantor  and five separate subsidiaries as borrowers entered into a million secured credit facility agreement 
the facility has a ten year term with a fixed annual interest rate of and monthly payments of interest only and matures on may  we have entered into standard nonrecourse carveout guarantees 
the obligations of the borrowers under the credit agreement are secured by cross collateralized first priority mortgages on of our multifamily communities 
we used the proceeds from this credit facility to repurchase outstanding debt  repay maturing debt  prepay mortgage debt  pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit  and general corporate purposes 
future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt  including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit 
during  approximately million of unsecured debt  including scheduled principal amortizations  are scheduled to mature 
see note  notes payable  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 
additionally  approximately million remains to be funded for one development project owned by a consolidated joint venture and we expect substantially all of the remaining expenditures to be funded from an existing construction loan 
we intend to meet our long term liquidity requirements through cash flows generated from operations  draws on our unsecured credit facility  proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes  and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 
in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
in december  we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of per share to our common shareholders of record as of december  the dividend was subsequently paid on january  we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units 
when aggregated with previous dividends  this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of per share or unit for the year ended december  the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions total thereafter debt maturities interest payments non cancelable lease payments postretirement benefit obligations construction contracts includes our line of credit and scheduled principal amortizations 
includes contractual interest payments for our line of credit  senior unsecured notes  medium term notes  and secured notes 
interest payments on hedged loans were calculated based on the interest rates effectively fixed by the interest rate swap agreements 
the interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates and our line of credit were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december  or the most recent practicable date 
off balance sheet arrangements the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured  third party debt 
we are also committed to additional funding under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures 
we have guaranteed no more than our proportionate interest  totaling approximately million  of five loans utilized for construction and development activities for our joint ventures and our commitment to fund additional amounts under the mezzanine loans was an aggregate of approximately million at december  inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months 
in an inflationary environment  we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases 
we believe the short term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
in the application of gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  results of operations during the reporting periods  and related disclosures 
our more significant estimates include estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets  estimates of the useful lives of our assets  estimates related to the valuation of our investments in joint ventures and mezzanine financing  and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
principles of consolidation 
we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
investments acquired or created are evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities vies  which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
if the investment is determined not to be a vie  then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate 
if we are the general partner in a limited partnership  or manager of a limited liability company  we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners or non managing members  as the case may be  to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners  or non managing members  as the case may be  overcome the presumption of control by us 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined in gaap with respect to our investments occurs 
the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
accordingly  we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 
asset impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
we consider projected future discounted cash flows  trends  strategic decisions regarding future development plans  and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist 
when impairment exists  the long lived asset is adjusted to its fair value 
while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding a number of factors  including market rents  economic conditions  and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates 
in estimating fair value  management uses appraisals  management estimates  and discounted cash flow calculations that maximize inputs from a marketplace participant s perspective 
during the quarter ended december   we recognized a million impairment charge to the previous carrying value of million for land holdings for eight future projects we have put on hold for the foreseeable future 
additionally  we recognized a million impairment charge relating to a land development joint venture we have put on hold for the foreseeable future 
this development joint venture had a previous carrying value of approximately million 
the impairment also included exit costs associated with this joint venture 
the estimates of fair value are based on what we believe to be marketplace participant expectations  and consider  among other things  the highest and best use of the land for example  as a multifamily development  or single family townhome construction  estimated timeframe and current estimates of construction and development costs  estimates of expected market rents and expenses upon completion of development  expected lease up periods  and expected net operating income or yield that a marketplace participant would expect to receive from the developed project 
we utilized opinions of value from third parties to supplement our estimates 
there were no significant market based transactions that have occurred during the previous twelve months for the land parcels that were analyzed 
in addition  we evaluate our investments in joint ventures and mezzanine construction financing and if  with respect to investments  we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value  or if  with respect to mezzanine loans  it is probable we will not collect all scheduled amounts due in accordance with the terms  we will record an impairment charge based on these evaluations 
in general  we provide mezzanine loans to affiliated joint ventures constructing or operating multifamily assets 
while we believe it is currently probable we will collect all scheduled amounts due with respect to these mezzanine loans  current market conditions with respect to credit markets and real estate market fundamentals inject a significant amount of uncertainty into the environment and any further adverse economic or market development may cause us to re evaluate our conclusions  and could result in material impairment charges with respect to our mezzanine loans 

table of contents the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions  including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities 
we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses 
due to  among other factors  the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses and the fact limited market information regarding the value of comparable land exists at this time  it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets  properties under development  and land is currently recoverable 
however  if market conditions deteriorate beyond our current expectations or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations  we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets 
any such material non cash charges would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
cost capitalization 
real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges 
carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development 
capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average unsecured interest rate 
most transaction and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition of real estate assets are expensed 
expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized 
all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed 
upon substantial completion of the apartment homes  the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land  respectively 
included in capitalized costs are management s estimates of indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
the estimates used by management require judgment  and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the codification 
effective july   the codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
we adopted the codification during the third quarter of and the adoption did not materially impact our financial statements  however our references to accounting literature within our notes to the consolidated financial statements have been revised to conform to the codification classification 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  which provides alternatives to measuring the fair value of liabilities when a quoted price for an identical liability traded in an active market does not exist 
the alternatives include using the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset or the quoted price of a similar liability or of a similar liability when traded as an asset  in addition to valuation techniques based on the amount an entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or receive to enter into an identical liability 
we adopted asu effective october  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  transfers and servicing topic accounting for transfers of financial assets  which codified the previously issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
asu modifies the financial components approach  removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  and clarifies and amends the derecognition criteria for determining whether a transfer of a financial asset or portion of a financial asset qualifies for sale accounting 
the asu also requires expanded disclosures regarding transferred assets and how they affect the reporting entity 
asu is effective for us beginning january  our adoption of asu will not have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  which codified the previously issued sfas  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
asu changes the consolidation analysis for vies and requires a qualitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie is based on whether the entity has the power to direct matters which most significantly impact the activities of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  of the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie 
the asu requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and also amends the events triggering a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
asu requires additional disclosures for vies  including disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement with vies  how a reporting entity s involvement with a vie affects the reporting entity s financial statements  and significant judgments and assumptions made by the reporting entity to determine whether it must consolidate the vie 
asu is effective for us beginning january  our adoption of asu will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  equity topic accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash 
the asu clarifies when the stock portion of a distribution allows shareholders to elect to receive cash or stock  with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash which all shareholders could elect to receive in the aggregate  the distribution would be considered a share issuance as opposed to a stock dividend and the share issuance would be reflected in earnings per share prospectively 
we adopted asu effective october  and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  consolidation topic accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary a scope clarification 
the asu clarifies the scope of subtopic applies to a subsidiary or group of assets considered to be a business or nonprofit activity  a subsidiary considered to be a business or nonprofit activity which is transferred to an equity method investee or joint venture  and an exchange of a group of assets considered to be a business or nonprofit activity for a noncontrolling interest in an entity including an equity method investee or joint venture 
asu further clarifies the scope of subtopic does not apply to sales of in substance real estate or conveyances of oil and gas mineral rights  even if these transfers involve businesses 
the asu also expands the disclosure requirements about deconsolidation of a subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets 
for entities who have previously adopted the noncontrolling interests guidance included in subtopic  asu is effective for interim or annual periods ending on or after december  and should be applied retrospectively to the first period in which the noncontrolling interests guidance was adopted 
as we adopted the noncontrolling interests guidance on january   we also adopted asu effective january  and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and december  december  weighted weighted average weighted average weighted maturity average maturity average amount in years interest of amount in years interest of in millions rate total in millions rate total fixed rate debt variable rate debt excludes balances outstanding under our unsecured line of credit  which are included in variable rate debt 
includes a million term loan entered into in and million of a construction loan entered into in which are effectively fixed by the use of an interest rate swap see discussion below 
we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline 
to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility thereby increasing our variable rate indebtedness  our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 

table of contents for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant  a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt  excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements described below  would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
we currently use interest rate hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable indebtedness  not for trading or speculative purposes 
under the hedge agreements we agree to pay a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate  and the counterparty agrees to pay us the interest rate that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of our hedge agreements was to fix the interest rate on approximately million of our variable rate debt 
had the hedge agreements not been in place during  our annual interest costs would have been approximately million lower  based on balances and reported interest rates through the year as the variable interest rates were less than the effective interest rates on the associated hedge agreements 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher through and the hedge agreements not been in place  our annual interest cost would have been approximately million higher 
derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements 
we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major  creditworthy financial institutions 
as part of our on going control procedures  we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity  thus minimizing credit risk concentration 
we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty non performance is remote
