item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or wastes into the environment 
our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
for more information on our operations  see item business our systems for additional information on our operations 
these laws include  for example  the federal clean air act and comparable state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions  rcra and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling  storage  treatment or disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities  cercla and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which our hazardous substances have been transported for recycling or disposal and the clean water act and comparable state laws that regulate discharges of wastewater from our facilities to state and federal waters 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or newly adopted laws or regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations 
certain environmental laws  including cercla and analogous state laws  impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or hydrocarbons have been disposed or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by noise  odor or the release of hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or waste products into the environment 
there is inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to our handling of natural gas  ngls and other petroleum products  because of air emissions and water discharges related to our operations  and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
for example  an accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury  natural resource and property damages and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
moreover  stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our operational or compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
for instance  the texas commission on environmental quality has recently conducted a comprehensive analysis of air emissions in the barnett shale area in response to reported concerns about high concentrations of benzene in the air near drilling sites and natural gas processing facilities  and the analysis could result in the adoption of new air emission limitations that could require us to incur increased capital or operating costs 
we are also conducting our own evaluation of air emissions at certain of our facilities in the barnett shale area and  as necessary  plan to conduct corrective actions at such facilities 
additionally  environmental groups have advocated increased regulation and a moratorium on the issuance of drilling permits for new natural gas wells in the barnett shale area 
the adoption of any laws  regulations or other 
table of contents legally enforceable mandates that result in more stringent air emission limitations or that restrict or prohibit the drilling of new natural gas wells for any extended period of time could increase our operating and compliance costs as well as reduce the rate of production of natural gas operators with whom we have a business relationship  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
for further information on environmental matters  see item business environmental  health and safety matters for additional information on environmental matters 
increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells  which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas that we gather  process and fractionate 
hydraulic fracturing is a process used by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells whereby water  sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and  to a lesser extent  oil production 
due to concerns that hydraulic fracturing may adversely affect drinking water supplies  legislation has been introduced in the us congress to amend the federal safe drinking water act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under that act and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
adoption of this or similar legislation or of any implementing regulations could impose operational delays  increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators  which could reduce their production of natural gas and  in turn  adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of natural gas that we gather  process and fractionate 
a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal  state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets  which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 
the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by ferc as a natural gas company under the nga 
we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company 
however  the distinction between ferc regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial  on going litigation  so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc  the courts or congress 
in addition  the courts have determined that certain pipelines that would otherwise be subject to the ica are exempt from regulation by ferc under the ica as proprietary lines 
the classification of a line as a proprietary line is a fact based determination subject to ferc and court review 
accordingly  the classification and regulation of some of our gathering facilities and transportation pipelines may be subject to change based on future determinations by ferc  the courts  or congress 
while our natural gas gathering operations are generally exempt from ferc regulation under the nga  our gas gathering operations may be subject to certain ferc reporting and posting requirements in a given year 
ferc has recently issued a final rule as amended by orders on rehearing  order requiring certain participants in the natural gas market  including intrastate pipelines  natural gas gatherers  natural gas marketers and natural gas processors  that engage in a minimum level of natural gas sales or purchases to submit annual reports regarding those transactions to ferc 
in addition  ferc has issued a final rule as amended by an order on rehearing  order requiring major non interstate pipelines  defined as certain non interstate pipelines delivering  on an annual basis  more than an average of bbtus of gas over the previous three calendar years  to post daily certain information regarding the pipeline s capacity and scheduled flows for each receipt and delivery point that has design capacity equal to or greater than  mmbtu d 
a petition for review of order is currently pending before the court of appeals for the fifth circuit  and requests for rehearing are currently pending before ferc  and we have no way to predict with certainty whether and to what extent order will be modified in response to the petition for review 
other ferc regulations may indirectly impact our businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses 
ferc s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities  including  for example  its policies on open access transportation  gas quality  ratemaking  capacity release and market center promotion  may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas market 
in recent years  ferc has pursued 
table of contents pro competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines 
however  we cannot assure you that ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to transportation capacity 
for more information regarding the regulation of targa s operations  see item business regulation of operations 
should we fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes  rules  regulations and orders  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
under the ep act  ferc has civil penalty authority under the nga to impose penalties for current violations of up to million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation 
while our systems have not been regulated by ferc as a natural gas companies under the nga  ferc has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non ferc jurisdictional facilities to ferc annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time 
failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject targa to civil penalty liability

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of ghgs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the products and services we provide 
on june   the us house of representatives approved adoption of the american clean energy and security act of  also known as the waxman markey cap and trade legislation acesa  which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program in the united states to reduce emissions of ghgs  including carbon dioxide and methane that may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
acesa would require an overall reduction in ghg emissions of from levels by  and by over by under acesa  covered sources of ghg emissions would be required to obtain ghg emission allowances corresponding to their annual emissions of ghgs 
the number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary to meet acesa s overall emission reduction goals 
as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year  the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 
the net effect of acesa will be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil  refined petroleum products  natural gas and ngls 
the us senate has begun work on its own legislation for controlling and reducing emissions of ghgs in the united states 
president obama has indicated that he is in support of the adoption of legislation to control and reduce emissions of ghgs 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the senate may act on climate change legislation or how any bill approved by the senate would be reconciled with acesa  any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of ghgs would likely require us to incur increased operating costs  and could have an adverse effect on demand for our gathering  treating  processing and fractionating services 
even if such legislation is not adopted at the national level  more than one third of the states either individually or collectively as part of a multi state  regional initiative have begun taking actions to control and or reduce emissions of ghgs  with most of the state and regional level initiatives focused on large sources of ghg emissions  such as coal fired electric plants 
it is possible that smaller sources of emissions could become subject to ghg emission limitations or allowance purchase requirements in the future 
any one of these climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  on december   the epa issued a notice of its final finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other ghgs present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
this final finding and determination by the epa allows the agency to begin regulating ghg emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act 
in late september  the epa announced two sets of proposed regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings and determination that would require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and also could trigger permit review for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us  including natural gas liquids fractionators  beginning in for emissions occurring in any limitation imposed by the epa on ghg emissions from our natural gas fired compressor 
table of contents stations  processing facilities and fractionators or from the combustion of natural gas or natural gas liquids that we produce could increase our costs of doing business and or increase the cost and reduce demand for our services 
the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
congress currently is considering broad financial regulatory reform legislation that among other things would impose comprehensive regulation on the over the counter otc derivatives marketplace and could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions 
the financial regulatory reform bill adopted by the house of representatives on december   would subject swap dealers and major swap participants to substantial supervision and regulation  including capital standards  margin requirements  business conduct standards  and recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
it also would require central clearing for transactions entered into between swap dealers or major swap participants 
for these purposes  a major swap participant generally would be someone other than a dealer who maintains a substantial net position in outstanding swaps  excluding swaps used for commercial hedging or for reducing or mitigating commercial risk  or whose positions create substantial net counterparty exposure that could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the us banking system or financial markets 
the house passed bill also would provide the cftc with express authority to impose position limits for otc derivatives related to energy commodities 
separately  in late january  the cftc proposed regulations that would impose speculative position limits for certain futures and option contracts in natural gas  crude oil  heating oil  and gasoline 
these proposed regulations would make an exemption available for certain bona fide hedging of commercial risks 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when congress will act on derivatives legislation or the cftc will finalize its proposed regulations  any laws or regulations that subject us to additional capital or margin requirements relating to  or to additional restrictions on  our trading and commodity positions could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activity 
our interstate common carrier liquids pipeline is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission 
targa ngl  one of our subsidiaries  is an interstate ngl common carrier subject to regulation by the ferc under the ica 
targa ngl owns a twelve inch diameter pipeline that runs between lake charles  louisiana and mont belvieu  texas 
this pipeline can move mixed ngls and purity ngl products 
targa ngl also owns an eight inch diameter pipeline and a inch diameter pipeline each of which run between mont belvieu  texas and galena park  texas 
the eight inch and the inch pipelines are part of an extensive mixed ngl and purity ngl pipeline receipt and delivery system that provides services to domestic and foreign import and export customers 
the ica requires that we maintain tariffs on file with ferc for each of these pipelines 
those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing these services 
the ica requires  among other things  that rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be just and reasonable and non discriminatory 
all shippers on these pipelines are our affiliates 
unexpected volume changes due to production variability or to gathering  plant or pipeline system disruptions may increase our exposure to commodity price movements 
targa sells our processed natural gas to third parties and other targa affiliates at our plant tailgates or at pipeline pooling points 
targa also manages the saou and lou systems natural gas sales to third parties under contracts that remain in the name of the saou and lou systems 
sales made to natural gas marketers and end users may be interrupted by disruptions to volumes anywhere along the system 
targa will attempt to balance sales with volumes supplied from our processing operations  but unexpected volume variations due to production variability or to gathering  plant or pipeline system disruptions may expose us to volume imbalances which  in conjunction with movements in commodity prices  could materially impact our income from operations and cash flow 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity programs and related repairs 
pursuant to the pipeline safety improvement act of  as reauthorized and amended by the pipeline inspections  protection  enforcement and safety act of  the dot  through the phmsa  has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines 
table of contents located where a leak or rupture could do the most harm in high consequence areas  including high population areas  areas that are sources of drinking water  ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release and commercially navigable waterways  unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area 
the regulations require operators of covered pipelines to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity  identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area  improve data collection  integration and analysis  repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary  and implement preventive and mitigating actions 
in addition  states have adopted regulations similar to existing dot regulations for intrastate gathering and transmission lines 
we currently estimate that we will incur an aggregate cost of approximately million between and to implement pipeline integrity management program testing along certain segments of our natural gas and ngl pipelines 
this estimate does not include the costs  if any  of any repair  remediation  preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program  which costs could be substantial 
at this time  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with this regulation  as the cost will vary significantly depending on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary as a result of the pipeline integrity testing 
following the initial round of testing and repairs  we will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines 
the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operations of our pipelines 
our construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and is subject to regulatory  environmental  political  legal and economic risks  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
one of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new midstream assets 
the construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involve numerous regulatory  environmental  political and legal uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital 
if we undertake these projects  they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all 
moreover  our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for instance  if we expand a new pipeline  the construction may occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until the project is completed 
moreover  we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize 
since we are not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas and oil reserves  we do not possess reserve expertise and we often do not have access to third party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing facilities in such area 
to the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct additions to our systems  such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production 
as a result  new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the construction of additions to our existing gathering and transportation assets may require us to obtain new rights of way prior to constructing new pipelines 
we may be unable to obtain such rights of way to connect new natural gas supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities 
additionally  it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights of way or to renew existing rights of way 
if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights of way increases  our cash flows could be adversely affected 

table of contents we do not have any officers or employees and rely solely on officers of our general partner and employees of targa 
none of the officers of our general partner are employees of our general partner 
we have entered into an omnibus agreement with targa  pursuant to which targa operates our assets and performs other administrative services for us such as accounting  legal  regulatory  corporate development  finance  land and engineering 
affiliates of targa conduct businesses and activities of their own in which we have no economic interest  including businesses and activities relating to targa 
as a result  there could be material competition for the time and effort of the officers and employees who provide services to our general partner and targa 
if the officers of our general partner and the employees of targa do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business  our financial results may suffer and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced 
if our general partner fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls  then we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our common units 
targa resources gp llc  our general partner  has sole responsibility for conducting our business and for managing our operations 
effective internal controls are necessary for our general partner  on our behalf  to provide reliable financial reports  prevent fraud and operate us successfully as a public company 
if our general partner s efforts to develop and maintain its internal controls are not successful  it is unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or it is unable to assist us in complying with our obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations 
ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units 
the amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our common units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability 
consequently  even if we are profitable  we may not be able to make cash distributions to holders of our common units 
you should be aware that the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow and not solely on profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings for financial accounting purposes 
terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business 
continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations 
the long term impact of terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september  and the threat of future terrorist attacks on our industry in general and on us in particular  is not known at this time 
however  resulting regulatory requirements and or related business decisions associated with security are likely to increase our costs 
increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business 
uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for our products and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of or indirect casualties of  an act of terror 
changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
moreover  the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital 

table of contents risks inherent in an investment in us cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and the establishment of financial reserves 
because distributions on the common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate  distributions may fluctuate based on our performance 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of the general partner 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits 
in order to make cash distributions at our current distribution rate of per common unit per complete quarter or per unit per year  we will require available cash of approximately million per quarter or million per year  based on common units outstanding as of february  we may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable us to make cash distributions at our current distribution rate under our cash distribution policy 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the fees we charge and the margins we realize for our services  the prices of  levels of production of and demand for  natural gas and ngls  the volume of natural gas we gather  treat  compress  process  transport and sell and the volume of ngls we process or fractionate and sell  the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices  cash settlements of hedging positions  the level of competition from other midstream energy companies  the level of our operating and maintenance and general and administrative costs  and prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the level of capital expenditures we make  our ability to make borrowings under our credit facility to pay distributions  the cost of acquisitions  our debt service requirements and other liabilities  fluctuations in our working capital needs  general and administrative expenses  including expenses we incur as a result of being a public company  restrictions on distributions contained in our debt agreements  the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner for the proper conduct of our business  and 
table of contents distribution support from targa as a result of the downstream business transaction 
targa controls our general partner  which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations 
targa has conflicts of interest with us and may favor its own interests to your detriment 
targa owns and controls our general partner 
some of our general partner s directors and some of its executive officers  are directors or officers of targa 
therefore  conflicts of interest may arise between targa  including our general partner  on the one hand and us and our unitholders  on the other hand 
in resolving these conflicts of interest  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the following situations neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires targa to pursue a business strategy that favors us 
targa s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the owners of targa  which may be contrary to our interests  and our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as targa or its owners  including warburg pincus llc  in resolving conflicts of interest 
targa is not limited in its ability to compete with us and is under no obligation to offer assets to us  which could limit our ability to acquire additional assets or businesses 
neither our partnership agreement nor the omnibus agreement between us and targa prohibits targa from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us 
in addition  targa may acquire  construct or dispose of additional midstream or other assets in the future  without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct any of those assets 
targa is a large  established participant in the midstream energy business and has significantly greater resources and experience than we have  which factors may make it more difficult for us to compete with targa with respect to commercial activities as well as for acquisition candidates 
as a result  competition from targa could adversely impact our results of operations and cash available for distribution 
the credit and business risk profile of our general partner and its owners could adversely affect our credit ratings and profile 
the credit and business risk profiles of the general partner and its owners may be factors in credit evaluations of a master limited partnership 
this is because the general partner can exercise significant influence over the business activities of the partnership  including its cash distribution and acquisition strategy and business risk profile 
another factor that may be considered is the financial condition of the general partner and its owners  including the degree of their financial leverage and their dependence on cash flow from the partnership to service their indebtedness 
targa  the owner of our general partner  has significant indebtedness outstanding and is partially dependent on the cash distributions from their indirect general partner and limited partner equity interests in us to service such indebtedness 
any distributions by us to such entities will be made only after satisfying our then current obligations to our creditors 
our credit ratings and business risk profile could be adversely affected if the ratings and risk profiles of the entities that control our general partner were viewed as substantially lower or more risky than ours 

table of contents our partnership agreement limits our general partner s fiduciary duties to holders of our units and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its owner  targa 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty laws 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity  as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner 
this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting  us  our affiliates or any limited partner  provides that our general partner does not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith  meaning it believed the decision was in the best interests of our partnership  generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner acting in good faith and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or must be fair and reasonable to us  as determined by our general partner in good faith and that  in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable  our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved  including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us  provides that our general partner and its officers and directors are not liable for monetary damages to us  our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or  in the case of a criminal matter  acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal  and provides that in resolving conflicts of interest  it is presumed that in making its decision the general partner acted in good faith and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or us  the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption 
cost reimbursements due our general partner and its affiliates for services provided  which will be determined by our general partner  will be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement we entered into with targa and targa resources gp llc  our general partner  targa receives reimbursement for the payment of operating expenses related to our operations and for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit 
payments for these services are substantial and reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders 
see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
in addition  under delaware partnership law  our general partner has unlimited liability for our obligations  such as our debts and environmental liabilities  except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner 
to the extent our general partner incurs obligations on our behalf  we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner 
if we are unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify our general partner  our general partner may take actions to cause us to make payments on these obligations and liabilities 
any such payments could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders 
holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and  therefore  limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 

table of contents unitholders will not elect our general partner or our general partner s board of directors and have no right to elect our general partner or our general partner s board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis 
the board of directors of our general partner is chosen by targa 
furthermore  if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they have little ability to remove our general partner 
as a result of these limitations  the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price 
we may issue additional units without your approval  which would dilute your existing ownership interests 
our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders 
the issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease  the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished  and the market price of the common units may decline 
affiliates of our general partner may sell common units in the public markets  which sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units 
as of february  targa and its management beneficially held  common units 
the sale of these units in the public markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop 
our general partner may elect to cause us to issue class b units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partner s incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of our general partner or holders of our common units 
this ability may result in lower distributions to holders of our common units in certain situations 
our general partner has the right when it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters  to reset the initial cash target distribution levels at higher levels based on the distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election 
following a reset election by our general partner  the minimum quarterly distribution amount will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution amount per common unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election such amount is referred to as the reset minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution amount 
in connection with resetting these target distribution levels  our general partner will be entitled to receive class b units 
the class b units will be entitled to the same cash distributions per unit as our common units and will be convertible into an equal number of common units 
the number of class b units to be issued will be equal to that number of common units whose aggregate quarterly cash distributions equaled the average of the distributions to our general partner on the incentive distribution rights in the prior two quarters 
we anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion  however  it is possible that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing or may be expected to experience  declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued our class b units  which are entitled to receive cash distributions from us on the same priority as our common units  rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels 
as a result  a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions 
table of contents that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new class b units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to our general partner s incentive distribution rights 
increases in interest rates could adversely impact our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions  for expansion capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as with other yield oriented securities  our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield 
the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield oriented securities for investment decision making purposes 
therefore  changes in interest rates  either positive or negative  may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions  for expansion capital expenditures or for other purposes 
our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning or more of our common units 
unitholders voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that any units held by a person that owns or more of any class of units then outstanding  other than our general partner  its affiliates  their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner  cannot vote on any matter 
our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent 
our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the owners of our general partner from transferring all or a portion of their respective ownership interest in our general partner to a third party 
the new owners of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own choices and thereby influence the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers 
our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than of the common units  our general partner will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price 
as a result  you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment 
you may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units 
as of december   our general partner and its affiliates own approximately of our aggregate outstanding common units 
your liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
a general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
our partnership is organized under delaware law and we conduct business in louisiana and texas as well as other states 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the states in which we do business 
you could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state s partnership statute  or 
table of contents your right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner  to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business 
unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them 
under certain circumstances  unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them 
under section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act  we may not make a distribution to you if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution  limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount 
substituted limited partners are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
tax risks to common unitholders our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service irs  were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
in order to maintain our status as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes  or more of our gross income in each tax year must be qualifying income under section of the internal revenue code 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
although we do not believe based upon our current operations that we are so treated  and despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under delaware law  it is possible  in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
a change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates 
distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to you 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 
current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
at the federal level  legislation has been proposed that would eliminate partnership tax treatment for certain publicly traded partnerships 
although such legislation would not apply to us as currently proposed  it could be amended prior to enactment in a manner that does apply to us 
we are unable to predict whether any such change or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 
moreover  any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively 
any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units 
at the state level  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise and other forms of taxation 
for example  we are required to pay texas franchise tax at a maximum effective rate of of our gross income apportioned to texas in the prior year 
imposition of any such tax on us by any other state will reduce the cash available for distribution to you 

table of contents our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations 
recently  however  the department of the treasury and the irs issued proposed treasury regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders 
although existing publicly traded partnerships are entitled to rely on these proposed treasury regulations  they are not binding on the irs and are subject to change until final treasury regulations are issued 
if the irs contests the federal income tax positions we take  the market for our common units may be adversely affected and the cost of any contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution 
you may be required to pay taxes on your share of our income even if you do not receive any cash distributions from us 
because our unitholders are treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  you may be required to pay any federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on your share of our taxable income even if you receive no cash distributions from us 
you may not receive cash distributions from us equal to your share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income 
tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected 
if you sell your common units  you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units 
because distributions in excess of your allocable share of our net taxable income decrease your tax basis in your common units  the amount  if any  of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units you sell will  in effect  become taxable income to you if you sell such units at a price greater than your tax basis in those units  even if the price you receive is less than your original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized includes a unitholder s share of our non recourse liabilities  if you sell your units  you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale 
tax exempt entities and non united states persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as individual retirement accounts iras  other retirement plans and non united states persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our 
table of contents income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non united states persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate and non united states persons will be required to file us federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
if you are a tax exempt entity or a non united states person  you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units 
we treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons  we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations and may result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns 
a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units 
if so  he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units  he may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units 
we have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of our common units 
when we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions  we will determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our valuation methods  subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section b adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods or our allocation of the section b adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
for purposes of determining whether the threshold has been met  multiple sales of the same interest are counted only once 

table of contents our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders  which would result in us filing two tax returns and our unitholders may receive two schedules k for one fiscal year and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine in a timely manner that a termination occurred 
the irs has announced recently that it plans to issue guidance regarding the treatment of constructive terminations of publicly traded partnerships such as us 
any such guidance may change the application of the rules discussed above and may affect the treatment of a unitholder 
you may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where you do not live as a result of investing in our common units 
in addition to federal income taxes  you may be subject to return filing requirements and other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property  now or in the future  even if you do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
further  you may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those return filing requirements 
we own assets and conduct business in the states of texas and louisiana as well as other states 
currently  texas does not impose a personal income tax on individuals 
as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may own assets or conduct business in states that impose a personal income tax 
it is your responsibility to file all us federal  state and local tax returns

this number does not include unitholders whose units are held in trust by other entities 
the actual number of unitholders is greater than the number of holders of record 
there is no established trading market for the  general partner units held by our general partner 
on february   we paid cash distributions of per unit on our outstanding common units 
the total distribution paid was million  with million paid to our non affiliated common unitholders and million  million and million paid to targa for its common unit ownership  general partner interest and incentive distribution rights 
distributions of available cash general 
our partnership agreement requires that  within days after the end of each quarter  we distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date  as determined by our general partner 
definition of available cash 
the term available cash  for any quarter  means all cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of available cash for that quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to provide for the proper conduct of our business  comply with applicable law  any of our debt instruments or other agreements  or provide funds for distribution to our unitholders and to our general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters 
minimum quarterly distribution 
we intend to make cash distributions to the holders of common units on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to at least the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit or per 
table of contents unit on an annualized basis  to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
however  there is no guarantee that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on the units in any quarter 
even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked  the amount of distributions paid under our policy and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our general partner  taking into consideration the terms of our partnership agreement 
the board of directors of our general partner has broad discretion to establish cash reserves that it determines are necessary or appropriate to properly conduct our business 
these can include cash reserves for future capital and maintenance expenditures  reserves to stabilize distributions of cash to our unitholders  reserves to reduce debt or  as necessary  reserves to comply with the term of any of our agreements or obligations 
we will be prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default or an event of default exists  under our credit agreement or indenture 
as part of our acquisition of targa s downstream business  targa agreed to provide distribution support to us in the form of a reduction in the reimbursement for general and administrative expense allocated to us if necessary or make a payment to us  if needed for a times distribution coverage ratio  at the current distribution level of per limited partner unit  subject to maximum support of million in any quarter 
the distribution support is in effect for the nine quarter period beginning with the fourth quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of no distribution support was required for the fourth quarter of general partner interest 
our general partner is currently entitled to of all quarterly distributions that we make prior to our liquidation 
as of february  our general partner interest is represented by  general partner units 
our general partner has the right  but not the obligation  to contribute a proportional amount of capital to us to maintain its current general partner interest 
the general partner s interest in these distributions will be reduced if we issue additional units in the future and our general partner does not contribute a proportional amount of capital to us to maintain its general partner interest 
incentive distribution rights 
our general partner also currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive up to a maximum of of the cash we distribute in excess of per unit per quarter 
the maximum distribution of includes distributions paid to our general partner on its general partner interest and assumes that our general partner maintains its general partner interest at

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash income or loss related to derivative instruments 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 

table of contents the economic substance behind management s use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make distributions to our investors 
the generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities and gaap net income 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
operating margin provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements  including such investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities

distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others to compare basic cash flows generated by us prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of our general partner to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this 
table of contents metric  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder 
the economic substance behind our use of distributable cash flow is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash flow sufficient to make distributions to our investors

in addition  transfers of net assets between entities under common control are accounted for as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period  and prior years are retroactively adjusted to furnish comparative information similar to the pooling of interests method 
the amount of the purchase price in excess of targa s basis in the net assets  if any  is recognized as a reduction to net parent investment 
our consolidated financial statements and all other financial information included in this report have been retrospectively adjusted to assume that the acquisition of the downstream business from targa by us had occurred at the date when both the downstream business and the north texas system met the accounting requirements for entities under common control october  following the acquisition of the saou and lou systems 
as a result  financial statements and financial information presented for prior periods in this report have been retrospectively adjusted 
overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed by targa to own  operate  acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary midstream energy assets 
we are engaged in the business of gathering  compressing  treating  processing and selling natural gas and fractionating and selling ngls and ngl products 
we are owned by our limited partners and by our general partner  targa resources gp llc  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of targa 
our limited partner common units began trading on the new york stock exchange on january  under the symbol ngls 
previously  our limited partner common units were listed on the nasdaq stock market llc under the same symbol 

table of contents we conduct our business operations through two divisions and report our results of operations under four segments our natural gas gathering and processing division is a single segment consisting of our natural gas gathering and processing facilities  as well as certain fractionation capability integrated within those facilities  and our ngl logistics and marketing division includes three segments logistics assets  ngl distribution and marketing  and wholesale marketing 
our natural gas gathering and processing assets are located primarily in the fort worth basin in north texas  the permian basin in west texas and the onshore region of the louisiana gulf coast 
our ngl logistics and marketing assets are located primarily at mont belvieu and galena park near houston  texas and in lake charles  louisiana  with terminals and transportation assets across the us factors that significantly affect our results our results of operations are substantially impacted by changes in commodity prices as well as increases and decreases in the volume of natural gas that we gather through our pipeline systems  which we refer to as throughput volume 
throughput volumes generally are driven by wellhead production  our competitive position on a regional basis and more broadly by prices and demand for natural gas and ngls which may be impacted by economic  political and regulatory development factors beyond our control 
contract mix 
our natural gas gathering and processing contract arrangements can have a significant impact on our profitability 
because of the significant volatility of natural gas and ngl prices  the contract mix of our natural gas gathering and processing segment can have a significant impact on our profitability 
negotiated contract terms are based upon a variety of factors  including natural gas quality  geographic location  the competitive environment at the time the contract is executed and customer preferences 
contract mix and  accordingly  exposure to natural gas and ngl prices may change over time as a result of changes in these underlying factors 
set forth below is a table summarizing the contract mix of our natural gas gathering and processing division for and the potential impacts of commodity prices on operating margins contract type percent of throughput impact of commodity prices percent of proceeds decreases in natural gas and or ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
wellhead purchases keep whole increases in natural gas prices relative to ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
decreases in ngl prices relative to natural gas prices generate decreases in operating margin 
hybrid in periods of favorable processing economics  similar to percent of proceeds or wellhead purchases keep whole in some circumstances  if economically advantageous to the processor 
in periods of unfavorable processing economics  similar to fee based 
fee based no direct impact from commodity price movements 
actual contract terms are based upon a variety of factors  including natural gas quality  geographic location  the competitive commodity and pricing environment at the time the contract is executed  and customer requirements 
our gathering and processing contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of producer preferences  competition  and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added  our expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common as well as other market factors 
we prefer to enter into contracts with less commodity price sensitivity including fee based and percent of proceeds arrangements 

table of contents we attempt to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our results of operations through hedging activities which can materially impact our results of operations 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
impact of our hedging activities 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas  ngls and condensate equity volumes for the years through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements with respect to our forecasted volumes for this period 
for additional information regarding our hedging activities  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
general and administrative expenses 
under the terms of the second amended and restated omnibus agreement the omnibus agreement  we reimburse targa for the payment of certain operating and direct expenses  including compensation and benefits of operating personnel  and for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit 
pursuant to these arrangements  targa performs centralized corporate functions for us  such as legal  accounting  treasury  insurance  risk management  health  safety and environmental  information technology  human resources  credit  payroll  internal audit  tax  engineering and marketing 
we reimburse targa for the direct expenses to provide these services as well as other direct expenses it incurs on our behalf  such as compensation of operational personnel performing services for our benefit and the cost of its employee benefits  including k  pension and health insurance benefits 
our general partner determines the amount of general and administrative expenses to be allocated to us in accordance with the omnibus agreement 
we reimbursed targa for these general and administrative expenses as follows i with respect to the north texas system  we reimbursed targa for a general and administrative expenses  which were capped at million annually  subject to certain increases through february   and b operating and certain direct expenses  which were not capped  and ii with respect to the saou and lou systems and the downstream business  we reimbursed targa for general and administrative expenses  which were not capped  allocated to the saou and lou systems and the downstream business according to targa s allocation practice  and operating and certain direct expenses  which were not capped 
during the nine quarter period beginning with the fourth quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of  targa will provide distribution support to us in the form of a reduction in the reimbursement for general and administrative expense allocated to us if necessary or make a payment to us  if needed for a times distribution coverage ratio  at the current distribution level of per limited partner unit  subject to maximum support of million in any quarter 
no distribution support was required for the fourth quarter of allocated general and administrative expenses  including expenses allocated to the downstream business  were million  million and million for  and were subject to the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
in addition to these allocated general and administrative expenses  we incur incremental general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a separate publicly held limited partnership 
these direct  incremental general and administrative expenses  which were approximately million  million and million during  and  including expenses associated with our equity offerings  financing arrangements and acquisitions 
these direct and incremental costs also include costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to unitholders  tax return and schedule k preparation and distribution  independent auditor fees  registrar and transfer agent fees and independent director compensation 
the historical financial statements of the saou and lou systems  the north texas system and the downstream business include certain items that will not impact our future results of operations and liquidity including the items described below affiliate indebtedness 
affiliate indebtedness prior to the contribution of the north texas system and our acquisitions of the saou and lou systems and the downstream business  consisted of borrowings incurred by targa and allocated to us for financial reporting purposes 
on january   targa contributed to us affiliated indebtedness related to the assets of the north texas system of million 
also on january   targa 
table of contents contributed to us affiliated indebtedness related to the assets of targa downstream lp and targa lsng lp of approximately million including accrued interest and additional borrowings 
during  and  we recorded million  million and million in interest expense associated with this affiliated debt 
on february   we borrowed approximately million under our credit facility 
the proceeds from this borrowing  together with approximately million of net proceeds from our ipo  were used to repay approximately million of affiliate indebtedness associated with the north texas system 
the remaining affiliated debt associated with the north texas system was retired and treated as a capital contribution to us 
on october   we completed our acquisition of the saou and lou systems concurrently with the sale of  common units representing limited partnership interests in us for gross proceeds of million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering  after million in offering expenses and the payment of million to targa for certain hedge transactions  of million along with net borrowings of million to pay approximately million of the acquisition costs of the saou and lou systems 
the allocated indebtedness from targa related to the saou and lou systems was million 
in conjunction with our acquisition of the saou and lou systems  the allocated indebtedness was retired 
on september   in connection with our acquisition of the downstream business  the entire balance of affiliated indebtedness payable to targa was settled with a million cash payment  the issuance of  common units with an agreed upon value of million  the issuance of  general partner units with an agreed upon value of million and a deemed parent contribution of million 
working capital adjustments 
prior to the contribution of the north texas system in february  and the acquisition of the saou and lou systems in october  all intercompany transactions  including commodity sales and expense reimbursements  were not cash settled with the targa  but were recorded as an adjustment to parent equity on the balance sheet 
the primary intercompany transactions between the respective parent and the predecessor business are natural gas and ngl sales  the provision of operations and maintenance activities and the provision of general and administrative services 
prior to acquisition of the downstream business in september  all intercompany balances related to the downstream business were settled with the parent as part of the customary settlement process 
accordingly  the working capital of the predecessor business does not reflect any affiliate accounts payable for the personnel and services provided or paid for by the applicable parent on behalf of the predecessor business 
distributions to our unitholders we intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner at least at the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per common unit per quarter per common unit on an annualized basis 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations 
as a result  we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources  including other debt and common unit issuances  to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures  as well as our working capital needs

under the terms of our amended and restated partnership agreement  all  subordinated units converted to common units on a one to one basis on may  general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expected results 
natural gas supply and outlook 
fluctuations in energy prices can affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new natural gas reserves 
generally  drilling and production activity will increase as energy prices increase 
the recent substantial decline in natural gas prices has led many exploration and production companies to reduce planned capital expenditures for drilling and production activities during which could lead to a decrease in the level of natural gas production in our areas of operation 
significant relationships 
the following table lists the percentage of our consolidated sales and consolidated product purchases with our significant customers and suppliers of consolidated revenues cpc of consolidated product purchases louis dreyfus energy services lp no other third party customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues or consolidated product purchases during these periods 
commodity prices 
our operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas  ngl and condensate prices  primarily as a result of our percent of proceeds contracts 
our processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which are beyond our control and have been volatile 
recent weak economic conditions have negatively affected the pricing and market demand 
table of contents for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which caused a reduction in profitability of our processing operations 
in a declining commodity price environment  without taking into account our hedges  we will realize a reduction in cash flows under our percent of proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines 
we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements by entering into hedging arrangements 
for additional information regarding our hedging activities  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
volatile capital markets 
we are dependent on our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets in order to fund acquisitions and expansion expenditures 
global financial markets have been  and are expected to continue to be  extremely volatile and disrupted and the current weak economic conditions have recently caused a significant decline in commodity prices 
as a result  we may be unable to raise equity or debt capital on satisfactory terms  or at all  which may negatively impact the timing and extent to which we execute growth plans 
prolonged periods of low commodity prices or volatile capital markets may impact our ability or willingness to enter into new hedges  fund organic growth  connect to new supplies of natural gas  execute acquisitions or implement expansion capital expenditures 
how we evaluate our operations our profitability is a function of the difference between the revenues we receive from our operations  including revenues from the natural gas  ngls and condensate we sell  and the costs associated with conducting our operations  including the costs of wellhead natural gas and y grade that we purchase as well as operating and general and administrative costs 
because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs  increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability 
our contract portfolio  the prevailing pricing environment for natural gas and ngls  and the natural gas and ngl throughput on our system are important factors in determining our profitability 
our profitability is also affected by the ngl content in gathered wellhead natural gas  demand for our products and changes in our customer mix 
our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption  and the following non gaap measures operating margin  operating expenses  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption 
our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from natural gas wells that are connected to our systems 
this is achieved by connecting new wells  adding new volumes in existing areas of production as well as by capturing supplies currently gathered by third parties 
in addition  we seek to increase operating margins by limiting volume losses and reducing fuel consumption by increasing compression efficiency 
with our gathering systems extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities  we monitor the volumes of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems  the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants 
this information is tracked through our processing plants to determine customer settlements and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption 
as part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations  we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss 
we also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the ngls and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plants to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of the facilities 
these volume  recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis 
operating margin 
we review performance based on operating margin 
we define operating margin as total operating revenues  which consist of natural gas and ngl sales plus service fee revenues  less product purchases  which consist primarily of producer payments and other natural gas purchases  and operating expense 
natural gas and ngl sales revenue includes settlement gains and losses on commodity hedges 
our operating margin is

operating margin provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements  including such investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  
table of contents our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of a specific asset 
direct labor  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance  utilities and contract services compose the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses generally remain relatively stable independent of the volumes through our systems but fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period 
adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash income or loss related to derivative instruments 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
the economic substance behind our use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make distributions to our investors 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities and gaap net income

we define distributable cash flow as net income attributable to targa resources partners lp plus depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes and amortization of debt issue costs included in interest expense  adjusted for non cash losses gains related to mark to market derivative instruments and debt repurchases  less maintenance capital expenditures 
distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others to compare basic cash flows generated by us prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of our general partner to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this metric  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an 
table of contents entity is generally determined by the unit s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder

liquidity and capital resources our ability to finance our operations  including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions  to meet our indebtedness obligations  to refinance our indebtedness  to meet our collateral requirements  or to pay our distributions will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including weather  commodity prices  particularly for natural gas and ngls  and our ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures  as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors 
our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  the issuance of additional equity and access to debt markets 
the capital markets continue to experience volatility 
many financial institutions have or have had liquidity concerns  prompting government intervention to mitigate pressure on the credit markets 
our exposures to the current credit conditions include our credit facility  cash investments and counterparty performance risks 
continued volatility in the debt markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets 
current market conditions also elevate the concern over counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit 
we have all of our commodity derivatives with major financial institutions or major oil companies 
should any of these financial counterparties not perform  we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation 
we sell our natural gas  ngls and condensate to a variety of purchasers 
non performance by a trade creditor could result in losses 

table of contents crude oil and natural gas prices are also volatile and have recently declined significantly 
in a continuing effort to reduce the volatility of our cash flows  we have periodically entered into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our estimated equity volumes through see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
the current market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts 
in the event of a continued global recession  commodity prices may stay depressed or fall further thereby causing a prolonged downturn  which could reduce our operating margins and cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had liquidity of million  including million of available cash and million of available borrowings under our credit facility 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
additionally  we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of the other twenty three lenders in our credit facility 
to date  other than the lehman bank default  we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access funds committed under our credit facility 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruptions in the credit environment 
our cash generated from operations has been sufficient to finance our operating expenditures and non acquisition related capital expenditures  with remaining amounts being distributed to targa during its period of ownership and to our unitholders since our ipo 
based on our anticipated levels of operations and absent any disruptive events  we believe that internally generated cash flow and borrowings available under our senior secured credit facilities should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations  non acquisition related capital expenditures  long term indebtedness obligations  collateral requirements and minimum quarterly cash distributions for at least the next twelve months 
we intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner in an amount at least equal to the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per common unit per quarter per common unit on an annualized basis 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations 
as a result  we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources  including other debt and common unit issuances  to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures 
historically  we have relied on internally generated cash flows for these purposes 
see factors that significantly affect our results distributions to our unitholders for a table that shows the distributions we declared paid in and working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
our working capital requirements are primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
these changes are impacted by changes in the prices of commodities that we buy and sell 
in general  our working capital requirements increase in periods of rising commodity prices and decrease in periods of declining commodity prices 
however  our working capital needs do not necessarily change at the same rate as commodity prices because both accounts receivable and accounts payable are impacted by the same commodity prices 
in addition  the timing of payments received by our customers or paid to our suppliers can also cause fluctuations in working capital because we settle with most of our larger suppliers and customers on a monthly basis and often near the end of the month 
we expect that our future working capital requirements will be impacted by these same factors 
prior to the contribution of the north texas system in february  the acquisition of the saou and lou systems in october and the acquisition of the downstream business in september  all intercompany transactions  including expense reimbursements  were not cash settled with targa  but were recorded as an adjustment to parent equity on the balance sheet 
the primary transactions between targa and us are natural gas and ngl sales  the provision of operations and maintenance activities and the provision of general and administrative services 
as a result of this accounting treatment  our working capital did not reflect any affiliate accounts receivable for intercompany commodity sales or any affiliate accounts payable for the personnel and services provided by or paid for by our parent prior to the acquisition of the north texas system and the subsequent acquisition of the saou and lou systems 
as of december   we had a positive working capital balance of million

capital requirements the midstream energy business can be capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations 
a significant portion of the cost of constructing new gathering lines to connect to our gathering system is generally paid for by the natural gas producer 
however  we expect to make significant expenditures during the next year for the construction of additional natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure and to enhance the value of our natural gas logistics and marketing assets 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either i maintenance expenditures or ii expansion expenditures 
maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets including the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life  the addition of new sources of natural gas supply to our systems to replace natural gas production declines and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
expansion expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  add capabilities  reduce costs or enhance revenues 
year ended december  in millions capital expenditures expansion maintenance our planned capital expenditures for are approximately million with maintenance capital expenditures accounting for approximately 
included in the planned capital expenditures for is the expansion of our facility at cedar bayou 
given our objective of growth through acquisitions  expansions of existing assets and other internal growth projects  we anticipate that over time we will invest significant amounts of capital to grow and acquire assets 
expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities 
credit facilities and long term debt as of december   we had outstanding loans of million and approximately million of availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates 
property  plant and equipment 
in general  depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the period it benefits 
our property  plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets 
at the time we place our assets in service  we believe such assumptions are reasonable  however  circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions  which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively 
examples of such circumstances include changes in energy prices  changes in competition  changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset  
table of contents changes in technology that render an asset obsolete  changes in expected salvage values  and changes in the forecast life of applicable resources basins  if any 
as of december   the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and we recorded million in depreciation expense for the weighted average life of our long lived assets is approximately years 
if the useful lives of these assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation expense may increase  liabilities for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in carrying values of tangible and intangible assets may result 
for example  if the depreciable lives of our assets were reduced by  we estimate that depreciation expense would increase by million per year  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our operating income 
in addition  if an assessment of impairment resulted in a reduction of of our long lived assets  our operating income would decrease by million per year 
there have been no material changes impacting estimated useful lives of the assets 
revenue recognition 
as of december   the partnership s balance sheet reflects total accounts receivable from third parties of million 
we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  of million 
the partnership s exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable relates to the financial health of its counterparties 
the partnership and its indirect parent  targa  have an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties 
if an assessment of uncollectibility resulted in a reduction of our third party accounts receivable  our annual operating income would decrease by million 
price risk management hedging 
our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
to reduce the volatility of our cash flows  we have entered into i derivative financial instruments related to a portion of our equity volumes to manage the purchase and sales prices of commodities and ii interest rate financial instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable debt 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our counterparties in these derivative financial instruments 
we also monitor ngl inventory levels with a view to mitigating losses related to downward price exposure 
our cash flow is affected by the derivative financial instruments we enter into to the extent these instruments are settled by i making or receiving a payment to from the counterparty or ii making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative financial instrument 
typically a derivative financial instrument is settled when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
one of the primary factors that can affect our operating results each period is the price assumptions we use to value our derivative financial instruments  which are reflected at their fair values in the balance sheet 
the relationship between the derivative financial instruments and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the derivative financial instrument and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a derivative financial instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs 
if it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the derivative financial instrument are reclassified to earnings immediately 
the estimated fair value of our derivative financial instruments was a liability of million as of december   net of an adjustment for credit risk 
the credit risk adjustment is based on the default probabilities by year for each counterparty s traded credit default swap transactions 
these default probabilities have been applied to the unadjusted fair values of the derivative financial instruments to arrive at the credit risk adjustment  which aggregates to less than million as of december  we and our indirect parent  targa  have an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties 
if a financial instrument counterparty were to declare bankruptcy  we would be exposed to the loss of fair value of the financial instrument transaction with that counterparty 
ignoring our 
table of contents adjustment for credit risk  if a bankruptcy by financial instrument counterparty impacted of the fair value of commodity based financial instruments  we estimate that our operating income would decrease by million per year 
recent accounting pronouncements 
for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that will affect us  see significant accounting policies included under note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in commodity prices  particularly to the prices of natural gas and ngls  changes in interest rates  as well as nonperformance by our customers 
we do not use risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk 
a majority of our revenues are derived from percent of proceeds contracts under which we receive a portion of the natural gas and or ngls or equity volumes  as payment for services 
the prices of natural gas and ngls are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
we monitor these risks and enter into hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business 
cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged 
the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow despite fluctuations in commodity prices 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  as of december   we have hedged the commodity price associated with a significant portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes for the years through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
the percentages of our expected equity volumes that are hedged decrease over time 
with swaps  we typically receive an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of natural gas or ngl and we pay the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices 
since we receive from our customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity  these transactions are designed to effectively lock in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged 
in order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than our actual equity volumes  we typically limit our use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than our expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes 
we utilize purchased puts or floors to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk 
we intend to continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into similar hedge transactions using swaps  collars  purchased puts or floors or other hedge instruments as market conditions permit 
we have tailored our hedges to generally match the ngl product composition and the ngl and natural gas delivery points to those of our physical equity volumes 
our ngl hedges cover baskets of ethane  propane  normal butane  isobutane and natural gasoline based upon our expected equity ngl composition 
we believe this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as proxy hedges of ngl prices 
our ngl hedges fair values are based on published index prices for delivery at mont belvieu through  except for the price of isobutane in  which is based on the ending pricing 
our natural gas hedges fair values are based on published index prices for delivery at waha and mid continent  which closely approximate our actual ngl and natural gas delivery points 
we hedge a portion of our condensate sales using crude oil hedges that are based on the nymex futures contracts for west texas intermediate light  sweet crude 
our commodity price hedging transactions are typically documented pursuant to a standard international swap dealers association form with customized credit and legal terms 
our principal counterparties or  if applicable  their guarantors have investment grade credit ratings 
our payment obligations in connection with substantially all of these hedging transactions and any additional credit exposure due to a rise in natural gas and ngl prices relative to the fixed prices set forth in the hedges  are secured by a first priority lien in the collateral securing our senior secured indebtedness that ranks equal in right of payment with liens granted in favor of our senior secured lenders 
as long as this first priority lien is in effect  we expect to have no obligation to post cash  letters of credit or other 
table of contents additional collateral to secure these hedges at any time  even if our counterparty s exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices or because there has been a change in our creditworthiness 
a purchased put or floor transaction does not create credit exposure to us for our counterparties 
during  and  we entered into hedging arrangements for a portion of our forecasted equity volumes 
floor volumes and floor pricing are based solely on purchased puts or floors 
during  and  our operating revenues were increased decreased by net hedge adjustments of million  million and million 
as of december   our commodity derivative arrangements were as follows natural gas instrument price mmbtu per day type index mmbtu fair value in millions swap if ngpl mc swap if ngpl mc swap if ngpl mc swap if waha swap if waha swap if waha swap if waha total sales basis swap jan may  rec if cgt  pay nymex less   mmbtu d fuel cost swap jan may  rec if cgt  pay  mmbtu d ngl instrument price barrels per day type index gal fair value in millions swap opis mb swap opis mb swap opis mb total swaps floor opis mb floor opis mb total floors total sales 
table of contents condensate instrument price barrels per day type index bbl fair value in millions swap ny wti swap ny wti swap ny wti swap ny wti total swap total sales these contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
if prices rise above the prices at which we have hedged  we will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
we account for the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities using a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the significant inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore required an entity to develop its own assumptions 
we determine the value of our ngl derivative contracts utilizing a discounted cash flow model for swaps and a standard option pricing model for options  based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets or are quoted by counterparties to these contracts 
in  all of our ngl contracts were classified as level within the hierarchy 
in  we were able to obtain inputs from quoted prices related to certain of these commodity derivatives for similar assets and liabilities in active markets 
these inputs are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for the full term of the commodity swaps and options 
for the ngl contracts that have inputs from quoted prices  we have changed our classification of these instruments from level to level within the fair value hierarchy 
for those ngl contracts where we were unable to obtain quoted prices for the full term of the commodity swap and options the ngl valuations are still classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of variable rate borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
to the extent that interest rates increase  interest expense for our revolving debt will also increase 
as of december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have entered into several interest rate swap and interest rate basis swap agreements 
under these agreements  which are accounted for as cash flow hedges  the base interest rate on the specified notional amount of our variable rate debt is effectively fixed for the term of each agreement and ineffectiveness is required to be measured each reporting period 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements  which are adjusted regularly  have been aggregated by counterparty for classification in our consolidated balance sheets 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses relating to the interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci until the interest expense on the related debt is recognized in earnings 
as of december  we had the following open interest rate swaps period fixed rate notional amount fair value in millions million million million million million 
table of contents we have designated all interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses relating to the interest rate swaps are recorded in oci until the interest expense on the related debt is recognized in earnings 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in the underlying interest rate  after taking into account our interest rate swaps  would increase our annual interest expense by million 
credit risk 
we our subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers 
our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to us at the reporting date 
at such times  these outstanding instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
should the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline  our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party 
in the event of a counterparty default  we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted 
as of december   affiliates of goldman sachs and bofa accounted for and of our counterparty credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments 
goldman sachs and bofa are major financial institutions  each possessing investment grade credit ratings  based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by standard poor s ratings services
