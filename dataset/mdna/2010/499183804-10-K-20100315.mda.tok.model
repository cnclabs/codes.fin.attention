item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flows  future financing and flexibility 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness  including accrued interest  and our stockholders deficit was million 
we pay interest in cash on our credit facilities 
our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business in a number of ways  including we may have to dedicate a significant amount of our available funding and cash flow from operating activities to the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on outstanding indebtedness  depending on the levels of our outstanding debt and the terms of our debt agreements  we may have trouble obtaining future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes  especially given the current volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets and the deterioration of general economic conditions  high levels of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  and increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure 
we may not be able to make future principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 
we currently generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to service our indebtedness 
however  our ability to make future principal and interest payments on our debt depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors 
table of contents 
index to financial statements affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
it is difficult to assess the impact that the general economic downturn and recent turmoil in the capital and credit markets will have on future operations and financial results 
we believe that the general economic downturn could result in reduced spending by customers and advertisers  which could reduce our revenues and our cash flows from operating activities from those that otherwise would have been generated 
if we cannot grow and generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to service our debt payments  we may be required  among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt  sell selected assets  or reduce or delay planned capital expenditures 
these measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  especially given the recent volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets and the deterioration of general economic conditions in the united states 
restrictions on our business imposed by our debt agreements could limit our growth or activities 
our credit agreements place operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
these restrictions affect  and any restrictions created by future financings will affect  our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional debt  create or incur liens on our assets  make certain investments  use the proceeds from the sale of assets  pay cash dividends on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock  utilize excess liquidity except for debt reduction  engage in potential mergers and acquisitions  sale leaseback transactions or other fundamental changes in the nature of our business  and make capital expenditures 
in addition  our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios  such as debt to ebitda earnings before income  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitda to cash interest 
these limitations may affect our ability to finance our future operations or to engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
if we violate any of these restrictions or any restrictions created by future financings  we could be in default under our agreements and be required to repay our debt immediately rather than at scheduled maturity 
weakening economic conditions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
during  the global financial markets were in turmoil  and the equity and credit markets experienced extreme volatility  which caused already weak economic conditions to worsen 
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions 
to the extent these conditions continue  customers may reduce the advanced or premium services to which they subscribe  or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our video  voice or data services 
this risk may be worsened by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services  such as video 
table of contents 
index to financial statements streaming over the internet  or substitute services  such as wireless phones 
if these economic conditions continue to deteriorate  the growth of our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to borrow under our credit facilities and to engage in other routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of financial services institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to different counterparties  and we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  investment banks and other financial institutions 
defaults by  or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could affect our liquidity or lead to losses or defaults by us 
our exposure to the credit risks of our customers  vendors and third parties could adversely affect our cash flow  results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers  many of whom may be adversely affected by the general economic downturn 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year  including falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  together with significant increases in unemployment  have severely affected consumer confidence and may cause increased delinquencies or cancellations by our customers or lead to unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased 
the general economic downturn also may affect advertising sales  as companies seek to reduce expenditures and conserve cash 
any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we delegate certain functions 
the same economic conditions that may affect our customers  as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets  also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices  reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely 
any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our cash flow  results of operation and financial condition 
we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully 
our future growth and profitability will depend in part on the success of integrating acquired operations into our operations 
our ability to successfully integrate such operations will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to devote adequate personnel to the integration process while still managing our current operations effectively 
we may experience difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses  which could increase our costs or adversely impact our ability to operate our business 
future acquisitions and joint ventures could strain our business and resources 
if we acquire existing companies or networks or enter into joint ventures  we may miscalculate the value of the acquired company or joint venture  divert resources and management time  experience difficulties in integrating the acquired business or joint venture with our operations  experience relationship issues  such as with customers  employees and suppliers as a result of changes in management  incur additional liabilities or obligations as a result of the acquisition or joint venture  and assume additional financial burdens or dilution in connection with the transaction 

table of contents 
index to financial statements additionally  ongoing consolidation in our industry may reduce the number of attractive acquisition targets 
the demand for our bundled broadband communications services may be lower than we expect 
the demand for video  voice and data services  either alone or as part of a bundle  cannot readily be determined 
our business could be adversely affected if demand for bundled broadband communications services is materially lower than we expect 
our ability to generate revenue will suffer if the markets for the services we offer  including voice and data services  fail to develop  grow more slowly than anticipated or become saturated with competitors 
competition from other providers of video services could adversely affect our results of operations 
to be successful  we will need to retain our existing video customers and attract video customers away from our competitors 
some of our competitors have advantages over us  such as long standing customer relationships  larger networks  and greater experience  resources  marketing capabilities and name recognition 
in addition  a continuing trend toward business combinations and alliances in cable television and in the telecommunications industry as a whole  as well as changes in the regulatory environment facilitating entry for additional providers of video service  may result in the emergence of significant new competitors for us 
in providing video service  we currently compete with bright house  charter  comcast  mediacom  midco and time warner 
we also compete with satellite television providers  including directv and echostar 
legislation now allows satellite television providers to offer local broadcast television stations 
this may reduce our current advantage over satellite television providers and our ability to attract and maintain customers 
the providers of video services in our markets have  from time to time  adopted promotional discounts 
we expect these promotional discounts in our markets to continue into the foreseeable future and additional promotional discounts may be adopted 
we may need to offer additional promotional discounts to be competitive  which could have an adverse impact on our revenues 
in addition  incumbent local phone companies may market video services in their service areas to provide a bundle of services 
as telephone service providers offer video services in our markets  it could increase our competition for our video and voice services and for our bundled services 
competition from other providers of voice services could adversely affect our results of operations 
in providing local and long distance telephone services  we compete with the incumbent local phone company in each of our markets 
at t  centurytel  qwest and verizon are the primary ilecs in our targeted region 
they offer both local and long distance services in our markets and are particularly strong competitors 
to succeed  we must also attract customers away from other telephone companies  such as clecs and voip service providers 
in the future  we may face other competitors  such as cable television service operators offering telephone services with internet based telephony 
cable operators offering voice services in our markets increase competition for our bundled services 
competition from other providers of data services could adversely affect our results of operations 
providing data services is a rapidly growing business and competition is increasing in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have advantages over us  such as greater experience  resources  marketing capabilities and name recognition 
in providing data services  we compete with local telephone companies that provide dial up and dsl services  providers of wireless or satellite based internet access services  and cable television companies 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  some providers of data services have reduced prices and engaged in aggressive promotional activities 
we expect these price reductions and promotional activities to continue into the foreseeable future and additional price reductions may be adopted 
we may need to lower our prices for data services to remain competitive and this could adversely affect our results of operations 
our programming costs are increasing  which could reduce our gross profit 
programming has been our largest single operating expense and we expect this to continue 
in recent years  the cable industry has experienced rapid increases in the cost of programming  particularly sports programming 
further  local commercial television broadcast stations are beginning to charge retransmission fees  similar to fees charged by other program providers 
our relatively small base of subscribers limits our ability to negotiate lower programming costs 
we expect these increases to continue  and we may not be able to pass our programming cost increases on to our customers 
in addition  as we increase the channel capacity of our systems and add programming to our expanded basic and digital programming tiers  we may face additional market constraints on our ability to pass programming costs on to our customers 
any inability to pass programming cost increases on to our customers would have an adverse impact on our gross profit 
see item business legislation and regulation regulation of cable services for more information 
programming exclusivity in favor of our competitors could adversely affect the demand for our video services 
we obtain our programming by entering into contracts or arrangements with programming suppliers 
a programming supplier could enter into an exclusive arrangement with one of our video competitors that could create a competitive advantage for that competitor by restricting our access to this programming 
if our ability to offer popular programming on our cable television systems is restricted by exclusive arrangements between our competitors and programming suppliers  the demand for our video services may be adversely affected and our cost to obtain programming may increase 
see item business legislation and regulation regulation of cable services program access for more information 
the rates we pay for pole attachments may increase significantly 
the rates we must pay utility companies for space on their utility poles is the subject of frequent disputes 
if these rates were to increase significantly or unexpectedly  it would cause our network to be more expensive to operate 
it could also place us at a competitive disadvantage with video and telecommunications service providers who do not require or who are less dependent upon pole attachments  such as satellite providers and wireless voice service providers 
see item business legislation and regulation regulation of cable services pole attachments for more information 
loss of interconnection arrangements could impair our telephone service 
we rely on other companies to connect our local telephone customers with customers of other local telephone providers 
we presently have access to at t s telephone network under a nine state interconnection agreement  which expires on december  we have access to verizon s telephone network in florida under an interconnection agreement covering florida 
the initial term of this agreement expired on november  however  the agreement has provisions allowing it to continue in effect after the initial term until a new agreement is executed 
knology notified verizon of its intent to continue operating under the existing agreement in november if the at t and verizon agreements are terminated or not renewed  we could be adversely affected and our interconnection arrangements could be on terms less favorable than those we receive currently 
it is generally expected that the act will continue to undergo considerable interpretation and implementation  including potential forbearance from federal regulation enforcing these carriers statutory 
table of contents 
index to financial statements obligations  which could have a negative impact on our interconnection agreements with at t and verizon 
it is also possible that further amendments to the communications act may be enacted which could have a negative impact on our interconnection agreements with at t and verizon 
the contractual arrangements for interconnection and access to unbundled network elements with incumbent carriers generally contain provisions for incorporation of changes in governing law 
thus  future fcc  state public service commission and or court decisions may negatively impact the rates  terms and conditions of the interconnection services we have obtained and may seek to obtain under these agreements  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to compete successfully in the provision of services will depend on the nature and timing of any such legislative changes  regulations and interpretations and whether they are favorable to us or to our competitors 
see item business legislation and regulation for more information 
we could be negatively impacted by future interpretation or implementation of regulations or legislation 
the current communications and cable legislation and regulations are complex and in many areas set forth policy objectives to be implemented by regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
it is generally expected that the communications act  the act and implementing regulations and decisions  as well as applicable state laws and regulations  will continue to undergo considerable interpretation and implementation 
from time to time federal legislation  fcc and psc decisions  or courts decisions interpreting legislation  fcc or psc decisions  are made that can affect our business 
we cannot predict the timing and the future financial impact of these legislation or decisions 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on the nature and timing of any such legislative changes  regulations and interpretations  and whether they are favorable to us or to our competitors 
see item business legislation and regulation for more information 
in particular  the united states district court for the district of columbia in paetec communications  inc v 
commpartners  recently held that the termination of voip originated calls is an information service not subject to access charges and that a tariff imposing such charges lacks legal force 
there have been inconsistent court  psc and fcc decisions on this issue that raise concerns about collecting revenue related to the termination of voip originated calls on our telephone networks 
we operate our network under franchises that are subject to non renewal or termination 
our network generally operates pursuant to franchises  permits or licenses typically granted by a municipality or other state or local government controlling the public rights of way 
often  franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material terms of the franchise order or the local franchise authority s regulations 
although none of our existing franchise or license agreements have been terminated  and we have received no threat of such a termination  one or more local authorities may attempt to take such action 
we may not prevail in any judicial or regulatory proceeding to resolve such a dispute 
further  franchises generally have fixed terms and must be renewed periodically 
local franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if they consider either past performance or the prospective operating proposal to be inadequate 
in a number of jurisdictions  local authorities have attempted to impose rights of way fees on providers that have been challenged as violating federal law 
a number of fcc and judicial decisions have addressed the issues posed by the imposition of rights of way fees on clecs and on video distributors 
to date  the state of the law is uncertain and may remain so for some time 
we may become subject to future obligations to pay local rights of way fees that are excessive or discriminatory 
the local franchising authorities can grant franchises to competitors who may build networks in our market areas 
recent fcc decisions facilitate competitive video entry by limiting the actions that local franchising authorities may take when reviewing applications by new competitors and lessen some of the burdens that can be imposed upon incumbent cable operators with which we ourselves compete 
local franchise authorities have the ability to impose regulatory constraints or requirements on our business  including those that could materially increase our expenses 
in the past  local franchise authorities have imposed regulatory constraints on the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements construction of our network either by local ordinance or as part of the process of granting or renewing a franchise 
they have also imposed requirements on the level of customer service we provide  as well as other requirements 
the local franchise authorities in our markets may also impose regulatory constraints or requirements that may be found to be consistent with applicable law but which could increase our expenses in operating our business

we may not be able to obtain telephone numbers for new voice customers in a timely manner 
in providing voice services  we rely on access to numbering resources in order to provide our customers with telephone numbers 
a shortage of or a delay in obtaining new numbers from numbering administrators  as has sometimes been the case for lecs in the recent past  could adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets or enlarge our market share in existing markets 
we may encounter difficulties in implementing and developing new technologies 
we have invested in advanced technology platforms that support advanced communications services and multiple emerging interactive services  such as video on demand  subscriber video on demand  digital video recording  interactive television  ip centrex services and pure fiber network services 
however  existing and future technological implementations and developments may allow new competitors to emerge  reduce our network s competitiveness or require expensive and time consuming upgrades or additional equipment  which may also require the write down of existing equipment 
in addition  we may be required to select in advance one technology over another and may not choose the technology that is the most economic  efficient or attractive to customers 
we may also encounter difficulties in implementing new technologies  products and services and may encounter disruptions in service as a result 
we may encounter difficulties expanding into additional markets 
to expand into additional cities  we will have to obtain pole attachment agreements  construction permits  telephone numbers and other regulatory approvals 
delays in entering into pole attachment agreements  receiving the necessary construction permits and conducting the construction itself have adversely affected our schedule in the past and could do so again in the future 
difficulty in obtaining numbering resources may also adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets 
we may face legal or similar resistance from competitors who are already in markets we wish to enter 
these difficulties could significantly harm or delay the development of our business in new markets 
see item business legislation and regulation regulation of cable services program access for more information 
we depend on the services of key personnel to implement our strategy 
if we lose the services of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain other qualified management personnel  we may be unable to implement our strategy 
our business is currently managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
we do not have any employment agreements with  nor do we maintain key man life insurance policies on  these or any other employees 
the loss of members of our key management and certain other members of our operating personnel could adversely affect our business 
our ability to manage our anticipated growth depends on our ability to identify  hire and retain additional qualified management personnel 
while we are able to offer competitive compensation to prospective employees  we may still be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining personnel  which could affect our ability to grow effectively and adversely affect our business

index to financial statements since our business is concentrated in specific geographic locations  our business could be adversely impacted by a depressed economy and natural disasters in these areas 
we provide our services to areas in alabama  florida  georgia  iowa  minnesota  south carolina  south dakota and tennessee  which are in the southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
a stagnant or depressed economy in the united states  and the southeastern or midwestern united states in particular  could affect all of our markets and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our communications services 
our network is attached to poles and other structures in many of our service areas  and our ability to provide service depends on the availability of electric power 
a tornado  hurricane  flood  mudslide or other natural catastrophe in one of these areas could damage our network  interrupt our service and harm our business in the affected area 
in addition  many of our markets are close together  and a single natural catastrophe could damage our network in more than one market 
risks related to relationships with stockholders  affiliates and related parties a small number of stockholders control a significant portion of our stock and could exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  regardless of the wishes of other stockholders 
as of february   the burton partnerships  our largest stockholder  owned approximately of our common stock

johnson  the company s ceo and chairman of the board  owned approximately of our common stock 
campbell b 
lanier  iii  another member of our board of directors  and members of mr 
lanier s immediate family owned approximately of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders have significant voting power with respect to the ability to authorize additional shares of capital stock or otherwise amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  elect our directors  or effect a merger  sale of assets or other corporate transaction 
the extent of ownership by these stockholders may also discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer to acquire us 
this could reduce the value of our stock 
risks related to our common stock if we issue more stock in future offerings  the percentage of our stock that our stockholders own will be diluted 
as of february   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
we also had outstanding on that date options to purchase  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
our authorized capital stock includes  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  which our board of directors has the authority to issue without further stockholder action 
future stock issuances also will reduce the percentage ownership of our current stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of the common stock 
as a result  our board of directors could issue shares of preferred stock with the right to receive dividends and the assets of the company upon liquidation prior to the holders of the common stock 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the value of our stock could be hurt by substantial price fluctuations 
the value of our common stock could be subject to sudden and material increases and decreases 
the value of our stock could fluctuate in response to our quarterly operating results  changes in our business  changes in the market s perception of our bundled services  changes in the businesses or market perceptions of our competitors  and changes in general market or economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years  including the decline in the stock market in  that have significantly affected the value of securities of many companies 
these changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the value of our common stock could increase or decrease based on change of this type  and the value of our common stock has declined significantly since the third quarter of these fluctuations could materially reduce the value of our stock 
fluctuations in the value of our stock will also affect the value of our outstanding warrants and options  which may adversely affect stockholders equity  net income or both

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  and other financial data elsewhere in this annual report 
to date  we have experienced operating losses as a result of the expansion of our service territories and the construction of our network 
we expect to continue to focus on increasing our customer base and expanding our broadband operations 
our ability to generate profits will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenues to offset the costs of construction and operation of our business 
in january  we completed the million acquisition of graceba total communications group  inc  which has delivered significant increases in key operating and financial metrics as well as being free cash flow accretive

current economic conditions we are exposed to risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers  many of whom may be adversely affected by the general economic downturn 
the housing market continues to suffer with depressed home prices  and along with continued high levels of unemployment  have severely affected consumer confidence and may cause increased delinquencies or cancellations by our customers or lead to unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased 
the general economic downturn also may affect advertising sales  as companies seek to reduce expenditures and conserve cash 
in addition  we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we delegate certain functions 
the same economic conditions that may affect our customers  as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets  also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices  reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely 
we believe the current economic conditions may impact the rate of organic growth in our business compared to previous years 
however  we believe that our strategy of operating in secondary and tertiary markets provides better operating and financial stability compared to the more competitive environments in large metropolitan markets 
we also believe that the highly bundled profile of our customer base about of our customers take two or three of our services and our companywide focus on customer service create added customer loyalty 
further  we believe that services such as cable television and high speed internet become more valuable as consumers spend more time at home and reduce discretionary spending during the current economic downturn 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting estimates described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use estimates to determine our allowance for bad debts 
these estimates are based on historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our delinquent customer accounts receivable 
capitalization of labor and overhead costs 
our business is capital intensive  and a large portion of the capital we have raised to date has been spent on activities associated with building  extending  upgrading and enhancing our network 
as of december  and  the net carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment was approximately million  of total assets  and million  of total assets  respectively 
total capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
costs associated with network construction  network enhancements and initial customer installation are capitalized 
costs capitalized as part of the initial customer installation include materials  direct labor  and certain indirect costs 
these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in connecting and activating the new service and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions 
the costs of disconnecting service at a customer s premise or reconnecting service to a previously installed premise are charged to operating expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements charged to operating expense as incurred  while equipment replacement and significant enhancements  including replacement of cable drops from the pole to the premise  are capitalized 
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized 
we capitalize direct labor and certain indirect costs using operational data and estimations of capital activity 
we calculate standards for items such as the labor rates  overhead rates and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity 
overhead rates are established based on an estimation of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities 
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead is incurred as a result of specific capital activities  and therefore should be capitalized 
the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are i employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor  ii direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities  consisting primarily of installation costs  iii the cost of support personnel that directly assist with capitalizable installation activities  and iv indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities 
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are reasonable  a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management s judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future 
we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies  and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with accounting standards codification asc and asc factors we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of our assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner in which we use our assets or significant changes in our overall business strategy  and significant negative industry economic trends 
in accordance with asc  we identified each separate geographic operating unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
these geographic operating units meet the requirements to be reporting units as they are businesses and legal entities in which separate internal financial statements are prepared  including a balance sheet  statement of operations and a statement of cash flows 
these geographic operating units are our markets as set forth under item business markets 
also  management evaluates the business and measures operating performance on a geographic operating unit basis 
the geographic operating units shown in the table on the next page represent all the operating units with goodwill on their balance sheets 
goodwill is subject to periodic impairment assessment by applying a fair value test based upon a two step method 
the first step of the process compares the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit  including any goodwill 
we utilize a discounted cash flow valuation methodology to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting unit  goodwill is deemed not to be impaired in which case the second step in the process is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  we perform the second step to measure the amount of impairment loss 
any impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill  calculated per asc  with the carrying amount of goodwill at the reporting unit  with the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value recognized as an impairment loss 
we have adopted january as the calculation date and have evaluated these assets as of january   and no impairment was identified 
based on the results of the test  we recorded no impairment loss to our goodwill as of january   and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our discounted cash flow calculation is based on a five year projection  with a terminal value applied to the cash flow of the fifth year 
we believe the discounted cash flow methodology utilizing a terminal value is the most meaningful valuation method because businesses like ours in the cable industry sector are generally valued based on a multiple of cash flow 
the discount rate of is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
our cash flow projections include a growth factor of year over year and a terminal multiple factor of applied to the fifth year cash flow projection 
our cash flow growth factor is based on historical organic growth rates  discounted from our growth rates before the current economic downturn 
it includes our expectation for continued annual pricing increases to our customers and continued growth in our residential and business video  voice and data connections 
our terminal multiple factor of is based on the most recent merger and acquisition transactions in our sector before capital markets effectively shut down as well as historical valuation multiples of companies in the cable industry 
we could record impairment charges in the future if there are long term changes in market conditions  expected future operating results or federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of goodwill 
for example  we believe a slowdown in the economy impacted our operating results during assumptions made about the continuation of these market conditions on a longer term basis could impact the valuations to be used in the january  annual impairment test and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the january  annual impairment test 
such assumptions and fair values will not be determined until the annual impairment test is performed 
the following table shows the net carrying value of goodwill as of december  and illustrates the hypothetical impairment charge related to changes in our discounted cash flows ie  fair value from any combination of adjustments to key assumptions at our last annual impairment test date 
net carrying values percent hypothetical reduction in fair value and related impairment charge in millions columbus dothan montgomery panama city huntsville rapid city sioux falls west point fair value measurements 
accounting standards codification asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
asc replaced financial accounting standards statement which we adopted with respect to fair value measurements of financial instruments on january  we record interest rate swaps in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value on a recurring basis 
asc provides a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
level inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
we currently have no level financial instrument assets or liabilities 
level inputs are inputs  other than quoted market prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
we use a discounted cash flow analysis of the implied yield curves to value our interest rate swaps 
we also consider our credit risk and counterparty

index to financial statements credit risk in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments 
while these inputs are observable  they are not all quoted market prices  so the fair values of our financial instruments fall in level as of december   the carrying value of our financial instrument liabilities was million 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability 
we currently have no level financial instrument assets or liabilities 
significant and subjective estimates 
the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for us to judge the application 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our ability to collect accounts receivable  valuation of investments  valuation of stock based compensation  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
homes passed and connections we report homes passed as the number of residential and business units  such as single residence homes  apartments and condominium units  passed by our broadband network and listed in our database 
marketable homes passed are homes passed other than those we believe are covered by exclusive arrangements with other providers of competing services 
because we deliver multiple services to our customers  we report the total number of connections for video  voice and data rather than the total number of customers 
we count each video  voice or data purchase as a separate connection 
for example  a single customer who purchases cable television  local telephone and internet access services would count as three connections 
we do not record the purchase of digital video services by an analog video customer as an additional connection 
as we continue to sell bundled services  we expect more of our video customers to purchase voice  data and other enhanced services in addition to basic video services 
further  business customers primarily take voice and data services  with relatively smaller amounts of video products 
on the other hand  we believe some of our phone customers  especially customers who are only taking our voice product  are moving to alternative voice products eg  mobile phones 
as a result of these various factors  we expect that our data connections will grow the fastest and that voice connections will benefit from our growing commercial business 
revenues our operating revenues are primarily derived from monthly charges for video  voice and internet data services and other services to residential and business customers 
we provide these services over our network 
our products and services involve different types of charges and in some cases a different method of accounting for recording revenues 
below is a description of our significant sources of revenue video revenues 
our video revenues consist of fixed monthly fees for basic  expanded basic  premium and digital cable television services  as well as fees from pay per view movies  fees for video on demand and events such as boxing matches and concerts that involve a charge for each viewing 
video revenues accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements voice revenues 
our voice revenues consist primarily of fixed monthly fees for local service and enhanced services  such as call waiting  voice mail and measured and flat rate long distance service 
voice revenues accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
data revenues 
our data revenues consist primarily of fixed monthly fees for data service and rental of cable modems 
data revenues accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
providing data services is a rapidly growing business and competition is increasing in each of our markets 
other revenues 
other revenues result principally from broadband carrier services 
other revenues accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our ability to increase the number of our connections and  as a result  our revenues is directly affected by the level of competition we face in each of our markets with respect to each of our service offerings in providing video services  we currently compete with at t  bright house  centurytel  charter  comcast  mediacom  midco  qwest  time warner and verizon 
we also compete with satellite television providers such as directv and echostar 
our other competitors include broadcast television stations and other satellite television companies 
we expect in the future to face additional competition from telephone companies providing video services within their service areas 
in providing local and long distance telephone services  we compete with the ilec and various long distance providers in each of our markets 
at t  centurytel  qwest and verizon are the incumbent local phone companies in our markets 
they offer both local and long distance services in our markets and are particularly strong competitors 
we also compete with providers of long distance telephone services  such as at t  centurytel which acquired embarq communications in and verizon 
we expect an increase in the deployment of voip services and expect to continue to compete with vonage holding company  cable competitors as they roll out voip and other providers 
in providing data services  we compete with ilecs that offer dial up and dsl services  providers of satellite based internet access services  cable television companies  providers of wireless high speed data services  and providers of dial up internet service 
data services and internet access is a rapidly growing business and competition is increasing in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have competitive advantages such as greater experience  resources  marketing capabilities and stronger name recognition 
costs and expenses our operating expenses primarily include cost of services  selling  operating and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
direct costs include direct costs of video services 
direct costs of video services consist primarily of monthly fees to the national cable television cooperative and other programming providers 
programming costs are our largest single cost and we expect this trend to continue 
programming costs as a percentage of video revenue were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have entered into contracts with various entities to provide programming to be aired on our network 
we pay a monthly fee for these programming services  generally based on the average number of subscribers to the program  although some fees are adjusted based on the total number of subscribers to the system and or the system penetration percentage 
since programming cost is partially based on numbers of subscribers  it will increase as we add more subscribers 
it will also increase as costs per channel increase over time  including retransmission costs we incurred with traditional networks beginning in

the direct costs of other services as a percentage of other revenue were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pole attachment and other network rental expenses pole attachment rents are paid to utility companies for space on their utility poles to deliver our various services 
other network rental expenses consist primarily of network hub rents 
pole attachment and other network rental expenses as a percentage of total revenue were approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we provide our services in competitive markets and we are not always able to pass along significant price increases and maintain margins  especially for our video services 
however  we expect higher margin voice  data and other revenue to become larger percentages of our overall revenue  and the favorable product mix may potentially offset pressures on gross profits within individual product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include the cost of sales and marketing personnel and advertising and promotional expenses

depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation of our interactive broadband networks and equipment  buildings and amortization of other intangible assets primarily related to acquisitions 
as our sales and marketing efforts continue and our networks expand  we expect to add customer connections resulting in increased revenue 
we also expect our cost of services and operating expenses to increase as we grow our business

operating revenues increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  operating revenues from video services increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period in operating revenues from voice services decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period in operating revenues from data services increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period in operating revenues from other services increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the same period in the increased revenues from video  data and other services are due primarily to an increase in the number of connections  from  as of december   to  as of december  and rate increases effective the first quarter of the additional connections resulted primarily from the private cable company pcl acquisition and continued growth in our bundled customers  continued strong growth in business sales  and continued penetration in our mature markets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we continued to add video connections in as the popularity of additional services and products such as dvr s and high definition televisions continued to grow 
however  the growth of new video connections has slowed over time relative to our other services as our video segment matures in our current markets 
while the number of new video connections may grow at a declining rate  we believe that new products and new technology  such as additional high definition channels and video on demand  will continue to fuel growth 
new voice and data connections are expected to increase as we continue our sales and marketing efforts directed at selling customers our bundled service offerings 
further  business customers primarily take voice and data services  with relatively smaller amounts of video products 
on the other hand  we believe some of our phone customers  especially customers who are only taking our voice product  are moving to alternative voice products eg  mobile phones

in addition  the increase in direct costs of video services is also due to higher programming costs  which have been increasing over the last several years on an aggregate basis due to an increase in subscribers and on a per subscriber basis due to an increase in costs per program channel 
further  local commercial television broadcast stations are charging retransmission fees beginning in  similar to fees charged by other program providers 
our direct cost of video services increased about million for these additional costs in  with annual percentage increases hereafter similar to our other cable programming costs 
we expect this trend to continue and may not be able to pass these higher costs on to customers because of competitive factors  which could adversely affect our cash flow and gross profit 
we expect increases in voice  data and other costs of services with the additions of leased facilities used to backhaul our traffic to our switching facilities as connections and data capacity requirements increase 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the decrease in our operating costs  included in selling  general and administrative included decreases in fuel expense  billing  installation costs  supplies  travel  and pole attachment rent  that were partially offset by increases in professional services  personnel cost  insurance expense  and bad debt expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and operating cash flows 
interest rate swaps involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate caps involve the receipt of variable rate amounts beyond a specified strike price over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
we believe that these agreements are with counterparties who are creditworthy financial institutions
