you should also carefully consider the factors set forth in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical systems based on proprietary drug delivery technology platforms 
we are developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems that will deliver the right drug to the right place in the right amount at the right time to treat chronic or episodic diseases and conditions 
by integrating chemistry and engineering advancements  we seek to achieve what drugs or devices alone cannot 
our pharmaceutical systems enable optimized therapy for a given disease or patient population by controlling the rate and duration of drug administration and providing sustained drug delivery 
in addition to developing our own proprietary products  we enter into strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize proprietary and enhanced pharmaceutical products based on our technologies 
we have six disclosed on going product candidates in clinical development 
collaborative research and development revenues collaborative research and development revenues consist of three broad categories a the amortization of upfront license payments on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party  b the reimbursement of qualified research expenses by third parties and c milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements 
during the last several years  we generated collaborative research and development revenues from collaborative agreements with endo  pain therapeutics  nycomed  king and others 
in contrast to our other collaborations  due to the terms and nature of the nycomed collaboration  we do not recognize revenue from the reimbursement of qualified research expenses by nycomed pursuant to asc  accounting for collaborative arrangements 
rather  we record research and development expense equal to our net share of the joint research and development expenses undertaken under the product development plan 
product revenues we currently generate product revenue from the sale of three product lines alzet osmotic pumps for animal research use  lactel biodegradable polymers which are used by our customers as raw materials in their pharmaceutical and medical products  and certain key excipients that are included in remoxy 
because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 
however  we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenue related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third party collaborators to develop product candidates based on our drug delivery technologies 
reduction in force in march  we reduced the size of our california workforce by employees or approximately of our headcount 
the goal of this action was to better align our cost structure with anticipated revenues and operating expenses  while not compromising our key corporate objectives for the year 
we substantially completed this headcount reduction during the first quarter of  and incurred approximately  in severance costs for the impacted employees in 
table of contents operating results since our inception in  we have had a history of operating losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our product candidates and to a lesser extent  from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the near future as we expect to continue to expand our clinical trials  nonclinical studies and other research and development activities as well as to incur additional stock based compensation costs related to research and development personnel 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain comparable in the near future 
we do not anticipate meaningful revenues from our pharmaceutical systems  should they be approved  for at least the next twelve months 
therefore  we expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued liabilities  contract research liabilities and stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the product is shipped and title transfers to customers  provided no continuing obligation exists  the price is fixed or determinable and the collectibility of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products and license and collaboration agreements pursuant to accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
multiple element agreements entered into are evaluated under the provision of asc  multiple element arrangements 
we evaluate whether there is stand alone value for the delivered elements and objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered element s to allocate revenue to each element in multiple element agreements 
when the delivered element does not have stand alone value or there is insufficient evidence of fair value for the undelivered element s  we recognize the consideration for the combined unit of accounting in the same manner as the revenue is recognized for the final deliverable  which is generally ratably over the longest period of involvement 
returns or credits related to the sale of products have not had a material impact on our revenues or net loss 
upfront payments received upon execution of collaborative agreements are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as collaborative research and development revenue based on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement 
such period generally represents the research and development period set forth in the work plan defined in the respective agreements between us and our third party collaborators 
research and development revenue related to services performed under the collaborative arrangements with our corporate collaborators is recognized as the related research and development services are performed and the collectibility of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
these research payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on reimbursement of qualified expenses  as defined in the agreements 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research and development agreements generally approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not expend the required level of 
table of contents effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective agreement 
pursuant to asc  collaborative arrangements  for joint control and funding development activities  we will not recognize revenue from the reimbursement of the research and development expenses but instead those reimbursements receivable from the joint venture party will be recorded as a reduction in research and development expense 
milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the at risk milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process related to that milestone 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research and development efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a third party collaborator 
as such  the milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the collaboration agreement  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
in addition  upon the achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that milestone payment 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and other compensation cost associated with research and development personnel  overhead and facility costs  preclinical and non clinical development costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs paid to third parties under sponsored research agreements are recognized as expense as the related services are performed  generally ratably over the period of service 
in addition  reimbursements by nycomed for research and development expenses incurred by us are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses incurred by nycomed and reimbursable by us are recorded as an addition to our research and development expenses in the period incurred 
intangible assets and goodwill we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies and intellectual property rights 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as completed or core technologies are amortized over time 
goodwill is not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the cost of an acquisition to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of those intangible assets subject to amortization  which determines the amount of amortization that will be recorded in a given future period and how quickly the total balance will be amortized 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the amount of any impairment charge is significantly impacted by and highly dependent upon assumptions as to future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate 
management believes that the discount rate used in this analysis is reasonable in light of currently available information 
the use of different assumptions or discount rates could result in a materially different impairment charge 
we perform a review for impairment of goodwill at least annually in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
no impairment of goodwill has been recorded through december  however  there can be no assurance that at the time other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities we incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for pre clinical studies  clinical trials  contract manufacturing  validation  testing  and other research and development related services 
we are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on management s estimates of project status 
if these good faith estimates are inaccurate  actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation under the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock  consistent with asc  compensation stock compensation 
we base the risk free rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
asc equires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted before january   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted on or after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share
