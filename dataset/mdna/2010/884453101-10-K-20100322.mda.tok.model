item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we make statements in this section that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
for a complete discussion of forward looking statements  see the section in this form k entitled forward looking statements 
certain risk factors may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion 
for a discussion of such risk factors  see the section in this report entitled risk factors 
when you read the financial statements and the information included in this report  you should be aware that our operations are significantly affected by both macro and micro economic forces 
our operations are directly affected by actual and perceived trends in various national and regional economic conditions that affect national and regional markets for commercial real estate services  including interest rates  the availability of credit to finance commercial real estate transactions  and the impact of tax laws affecting real estate 
periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  tightening of the credit markets  declining demand for or increased supply of real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur can adversely affect our business 
these conditions could result in a general decline in rents  which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from leases 
in addition  these conditions could lead to a decline in property values as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets  which in turn may reduce revenues from investment advisory  property management  leasing and development fees 
overview and background we are a full service real estate operating company that owns  acquires  develops and manages primarily office  as well as mixed use and residential properties on a nationwide basis 
we conduct our business through our operating partnership  of which we own as of december  and have control over the major decisions of the operating partnership 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the relevant reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting estimates  as these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
we believe the following accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to our financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
investments in real estate 
the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to 
table of contents allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to non market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we evaluate a property for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current book value of the property may not be recoverable 
indicators of potential impairment include among other things declining occupancy levels  declining rental rates  increasing number of tenants unable to pay their rent  deterioration in the local rental market  declining market values  our competitors beginning to experience financial difficulty or impair similar assets  and our inability or change of intent to hold the property 
in the event that these periodic assessments result in a determination that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property 
estimates of expected future net cash flows are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
these estimates are highly subjective and require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  occupancy levels  the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property or inability to sell the property  holding periods  market conditions  accessibility of capital and credit markets  recent sales activity of similar properties in the same market  our liquidity and ability and intent to hold the properties  development and construction costs  and discount rates 
these estimates can change significantly between reporting periods 
due to the fact that estimates included in cash flow models are based on historical results and projected trends  unexpected changes in market conditions may lead to additional impairment charges in the future that cannot be anticipated 
we use the equity method of accounting to account for investments in real estate entities over which we have significant influence  but not control over major decisions 
in these situations  the unit of account for measurement purposes is the equity investment and not the real estate 
accordingly  if our joint venture investments meet the other than temporary criteria of fasb asc  investments equity method and joint ventures  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of our investment 
with respect to condominium units held for sale  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell the project 
estimates of fair value are often based on expected future net cash flows  which are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the project 
these estimates require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things  sales absorption rates  selling prices and discount rates

table of contents revenue recognition 
leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases 
rental income is recognized as earned based upon the contractual terms of the leases with tenants 
minimum annual rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term regardless of when the payments are made 
the deferred rents asset on our balance sheets represents the aggregate excess rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the cash received under the applicable lease provisions 
our leases generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate related taxes associated with the property 
these reimbursements are recognized as revenues in the period the related expenses are incurred 
real estate commissions on leases we charge to third party owners of rental properties are generally recorded as income after we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement 
a typical commission agreement provides that we earn of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant 
the remaining of the lease commission is earned at a later date  usually upon tenant occupancy 
the existence of any significant future contingencies will delay recognition of commission revenue until those contingencies are satisfied 
in addition  we eliminate lease commissions we charge on our ownership share of rental properties 
investment advisory  property management and development services fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements 
we have one high rise condominium project for which we used the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize costs and sales during the construction period  up through and including june  commencing with the third quarter of  we have applied the deposit method of accounting to recognize sales revenue and costs 
under the provisions of fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsection real estate and sales  revenue and costs for projects are recognized when all parties are bound by the terms of the contract  all consideration has been exchanged  any permanent financing for which the seller is responsible has been arranged and all conditions precedent to closing have been performed 
this results in profit from the sale of condominium units recognized at the point of settlement as compared to the point of sale 
revenue is recognized on the contract price of individual units 
total estimated costs  net of impairment charges  are allocated to individual units which have closed on a relative value basis 
total estimated revenue and construction costs are reviewed periodically  and any change is applied to current and future periods 
allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rents receivable 
tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for estimated uncollectible tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent 
our determination of the adequacy of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
unbilled deferred rents receivable represents the amount that the cumulative straight line rental revenue recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreements 
given the longer term nature of these types of receivables  our determination of the adequacy of the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivables is based primarily on historical loss experience 
we evaluate the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivable using a specific identification methodology for our company s significant tenants  assessing a tenant s financial condition and the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations 
in addition  the allowance includes a reserve based upon our historical experience and current and anticipated future economic conditions that are not associated with any specific tenant 
depreciable lives of leasing costs 
we incur certain capital costs in connection with leasing our properties 
these costs consist primarily of lease commissions and tenant improvements 
lease costs are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the estimated remaining term of the lease  ranging from one to years 
we reevaluate the remaining useful life of these costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants changes 
if we determine that the estimated remaining life of the respective lease has changed  we adjust the amortization period and  therefore  the amortization or depreciation expense recorded each period may fluctuate 
if we experience increased levels of amortization or depreciation expense due to changes in the estimated useful lives of leasing costs  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
income taxes 
we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states  and also in states and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to fasb asc  income taxes 
fasb asc requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating 
table of contents loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
in accordance with the criteria of fasb asc  contingencies  we record tax contingencies when the exposure item becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
we assess the tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis and maintain the required tax reserves until the underlying issue is resolved or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations 
our estimate of potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
in july  the fasb issued fasb asc  income taxes  which was effective for our company on january  fasb asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position would more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we recorded the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at january  factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a summary of the more significant factors we believe may affect our results of operations 
for a more detailed discussion regarding the factors that you should consider before making a decision to acquire shares of our common stock  see the information under the caption risk factors elsewhere in this report 
rental income 
the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space  to lease currently available space as well as space in newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in the submarkets where our properties are located 
los angeles  philadelphia  austin  and houston submarket information 
a significant portion of our income is derived from properties located in los angeles  philadelphia  austin and houston 
the market conditions in these submarkets have a significant impact on our results of operations 
information regarding significant tenants conrail 
a significant amount of space at our two commerce square property has historically been leased to csx corporation conrail 
approximately half or  square feet of this lease expired in june and the remaining half expired in june we have entered into agreements with replacement tenants at rental rates which are lower than the rates paid by conrail 
as a result  our aggregate revenues from this property are lower following the expiration of the conrail lease 
we have entered into direct leases for  square feet of the conrail space 
the lease terms range from months to months 
because of these direct leases  we no longer have any significant tenant concentration with conrail 
development and redevelopment activities 
we believe that our development activities present growth opportunities for us over the next several years 
we continually evaluate the size  timing and scope of our development and redevelopment initiatives and  as necessary  sales activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our submarkets 
however  we may not be able to lease committed development or redevelopment properties at expected rental rates or within projected time frames or complete projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we currently own interests in four development projects  and tpg calstrs owns four redevelopment properties and two development sites 
as of december   we had incurred  on a consolidated basis  approximately million of predevelopment and infrastructure costs that are reflected in land improvements development properties on our balance sheet 
to the extent that we  or joint ventures we are a partner in  do not proceed with projects as planned  development and or redevelopment costs would need to be evaluated for impairment 

table of contents results of operations the results of operations reflect the consolidation of the affiliates that own one commerce square  two commerce square  murano  jfk boulevard  four points centre  campus el segundo and our investment advisory  property management  leasing and real estate development operations

total revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the significant components of revenue are discussed below 
rental revenues 
rental revenue decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to a scheduled expiration in june of a significant lease conrail at two commerce square representing approximately  rentable square feet 
approximately of the space from the june conrail lease expiration has been leased to former subtenants or new tenants at current market rates  which are lower than the expired lease rates 

table of contents tenant reimbursements 
tenant reimbursements decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to the scheduled expiration in june of the conrail lease at two commerce square 
approximately half or  rentable square feet expired in june and the remaining half expired in june this decrease in reimbursement revenue was offset by revenues from former subtenants that are now direct tenants or new tenants 
parking and other revenues 
parking and other revenues decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to a decrease in transient and monthly parking at commerce square 
investment advisory  management  leasing and development services revenues 
this caption represents revenues earned from services provided to unaffiliated entities in which we have no ownership interest 
revenues from these services increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a new development services contract signed with korean air and increased leasing activity at our managed properties 
investment advisory  management  leasing and development services revenues unconsolidated real estate entities 
this caption represents revenues earned from services provided to entities in which we use the equity method to account for our ownership interest since we have significant influence  but not control over the entities 
revenues from these services from unconsolidated real estate entities decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in leasing commission revenue of million and a decrease in development and construction management fee revenue of million across the portfolio 
reimbursement of property personnel costs 
this caption represents the reimbursement for property personnel salary  payroll taxes and benefits 
the decrease of million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  was primarily a result of paying the property level bonuses during which resulted in two years of bonus payments  both and  being included in but only one year of expense being included in condominium sales 
this caption represents the revenue recognized for murano condominium units and parking spaces which closed as of december  the decrease of million or was primarily the result of a reduction in sales volume 
for the twelve months ended december  we recognized revenue of million  based on the sale of units and parking spaces 
for the twelve months ended december  we recognized revenue of million  based on the sale of units and parking spaces 
up to and including the quarter ended june   we accounted for units and parking spaces under contract of sale based on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
total expenses 
total expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the significant components of expense are discussed below 
rental property operating and maintenance expense 
rental property operating and maintenance expense remained consistent for each of the twelve month periods ended december  and real estate taxes 
real estate taxes increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily the result of increased philadelphia business taxes assessed on the sales proceeds of the murano condominiums 
investment advisory  management  leasing and development services expenses 
these expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for 
table of contents the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in the use of consultants for system improvements and development services and a decrease in legal fees related to our formation of the green fund 
reimbursable property personnel costs 
this caption represents the reimbursement of property personnel salary  payroll taxes and benefits 
the decrease of million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  was primarily a result of paying the property level bonuses during which resulted in two years of bonus payments  both and  being included in but only one year of expense being included in cost of condominium sales 
the decrease of million is due to reduced sales of units during for the twelve months ended december   we recognized costs of million  based on sales of units and parking spaces compared with million for the twelve months ended december   based on sales of units and parking spaces 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to million in interest costs no longer being capitalized on murano and our four points office buildings due to the completion of development on these projects during the year ended december  offset primarily due to a decrease in interest expense relating to the murano of approximately million resulting from payments on of the construction loan 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is partially attributable to the purchase of interests in one and two commerce square during the increase is also attributable to the completion of construction and opening of the marketing center at campus el segundo during general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to costs associated with the postponed equity offering during impairment loss 
we recognized an impairment charge related to our murano condominium project whose units are complete and held for sale of million for the year ended december  compared to an million impairment charge for the year ended december  we are required to record murano at its estimated fair value as it meets the held for sale criteria of fasb asc  property  plant and equipment 
these non cash impairment charges related to murano are included in the impairment loss line item in the consolidated statements of operations for the respective years 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge in accordance with the criteria of fasb asc  investments equity method and joint ventures for our investment in the austin joint venture  which is accounted for under the equity method  of million for the year ended december  compared to a million impairment charge for the year ended december  additionally  we recorded impairment charges related to certain of our other properties accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
our percent share of these impairment charges is as follows four falls corporate center of million  walnut hill plaza of million and centerpointe i ii of million 
there were no impairment charges recorded for these properties for the year ended december  these non cash impairment charges related to both our investment in the austin joint venture and other properties accounted for using the equity method are included in the equity in net loss of unconsolidated real estate entities line item in the consolidated statements of operations for the respective years 
as discussed in our critical accounting policies  the estimates of expected future net cash flows are inherently uncertain  and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the properties 
these estimates can change significantly between reporting periods 
due to the fact that estimates included in cash flow models are based on historical results and projected trends  unexpected changes in market conditions may lead to additional impairment charges in the future that cannot be anticipated 

table of contents one key assumption considered in our undiscounted cash flows test is the investment holding period 
certain of our properties city national plaza  city west  brookhollow central and citywestplace have debt that matures in if we are unable to successfully refinance or extend all or a portion of this debt  the holding period used for the impairment testing would be subject to reconsideration  potentially resulting in undiscounted cash flows less than the book carrying values  which could potentially result in impairment if the estimated fair market value of these assets is less than their book carrying amount 
with respect to city national plaza  city west and citywestplace  the estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis for each asset exceeds the book carrying value  so no impairment would exist 
with respect to brookhollow central  we believe it will be successfully refinanced as the estimated fair value is sufficiently greater than the debt balance 
there could potentially be an impairment loss  though  if the holding period were revised as the estimated fair value for this asset is less than the book carrying amount 
further  our oak hill plaza property failed the undiscounted cash flows test at december  using a limited holding period in the test due to uncertainty regarding the maturing debt due in march the estimated fair market value for oak hill plaza exceeds the book carrying value  though  so there is no impairment loss 
additionally  the book carrying value of our murano project  net of the impairment charges recorded as of december   is reflective of the company s estimation of future absorption rates and sales prices  which are supported by a third party appraisal 
if the actual absorption and sales prices are materially less than the projection  we could potentially need to record additional impairment in future periods 
gain on sale of real estate 
gain on sale of real estate decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the twelve months ended december  we recognized a gain of million related to the sale of a acre land parcel adjacent to our four points development project 
for the twelve months ended december  we recognized a previously deferred gain of million related to the sale of a parcel of land at our campus el segundo development project 
a acre parcel at campus el segundo was sold in for million resulting in a total gain of million 
we were obligated to fund certain infrastructure improvements of approximately million with respect to the development of the sold parcel 
the remaining deferred gain was recognized upon completion of the remaining infrastructure improvements during the year ended december  interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   due to declining investment balances and lower interest rates 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated real estate entities 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated real estate entities increased by million  or  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  set forth below is a summary of the unconsolidated condensed financial information for the unconsolidated real estate entities and our share of net loss and equity in net loss for the years ended december  and in thousands revenue operating and other expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization impairment loss gain on early extinguishment of debt loss from discontinued operations net loss thomas properties share of net loss intercompany eliminations equity in net loss of unconsolidated real estate entities 
table of contents net loss from unconsolidated real estate entities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  decreased  primarily due to the gain from the extinguishment of debt in the austin portfolio joint venture and decreased interest expense resulting from lower interest rates on floating rate debt  offset by impairment charges recognized during our share of net loss from unconsolidated real estate entities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased primarily due to our relatively smaller interest in the austin portfolio joint venture s gain on early extinguishment of debt 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased by million  or  to a provision of million for the year ended december  compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  this change is attributable primarily to the company recording a valuation allowance of million in the current year 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the significant components of revenue are discussed below 
rental revenues 
rental revenue decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to a scheduled expiration in june of a significant lease at two commerce square representing approximately  rentable square feet

revenues from these services from unconsolidated real estate entities increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of an increase in fee income of million related to the austin portfolio joint venture properties acquired in june and an increase of million in fee income related to the rest of the portfolio  which was offset by a decrease in acquisition fees of million related to the property investments in fairfax  virginia acquired in january  and austin  texas acquired in june as well as a decrease of million in asset management fees primarily related to our houston portfolio 

table of contents reimbursement of property personnel costs 
this caption represents the reimbursement for property personnel salary  payroll taxes and benefits

rental property operating and maintenance expense 
rental property operating and maintenance expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in various operating expenses  such as professional services  engineering  utilities and business taxes as well as increased bad debt charges  and marketing and other expenses related to our completed development properties 
real estate taxes 
real estate taxes remained consistent for each for the twelve month periods ended december  and investment advisory  management  leasing and development services expenses

refer to our tax rate reconciliation in our financial statement footnotes for a detailed reconciliation of our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources analysis of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
we believe that we will have sufficient capital to satisfy our liquidity needs over the next months through working capital 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  including debt service  property and undeveloped land acquisitions and additional future development and redevelopment activity  through cash flow from operations  additional secured and unsecured long term borrowings  dispositions of non strategic assets  and the potential issuance of additional debt  or common or preferred equity securities  including convertible securities 
additionally  as noted elsewhere herein  on december   the company completed the sale of million shares through a registered direct offering of common stock at per share 
the net proceeds after deducting offering expenses were million 
we used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the discounted payoff of million for million in nonrecourse senior and junior mezzanine loans on two commerce square which were scheduled to mature in january we do not have any present intent to reserve funds to retire existing debt upon maturity 
we will instead seek to refinance this debt at maturity or retire the long term debt through the issuance of securities  as market conditions permit 
there can be no assurances that such debt refinancing will be available at the time of such maturities on acceptable terms  if at all  and our cost of capital could increase as a result of any such debt refinancing 
if we are unable to obtain debt refinancing for properties in which we own an interest at maturity  we may lose some or all of our equity interests in such properties 
additionally  existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution in the event we are required to issue additional equity capital 
on march   an aggregate of million in mortgage loans owed by subsidiaries of tpg calstrs on unconsolidated properties at four falls corporate center and oak hill plaza walnut hill plaza matured and became due in full 
the borrowers under these loans have not  as of march   made payment on these loans and they are currently in default 
these loans are non recourse to the company  and we do not anticipate making any payments or equity contributions to support the repayment or refinancing of these loans 
the borrowers are currently in discussions with the lenders to restructure the debt or facilitate a sale or other liquidation of these properties 
we do not believe that the loss of our equity interests in these properties will have a material effect on our business or results of operations 
as of december   we have unfunded capital commitments to our joint venture with calstrs of million  and the thomas high performance green fund  an investment fund formed by us  calstrs and other institutional investors  of million 
with respect to our joint venture with calstrs  we are not obligated to fund our share of the capital commitment for the acquisition of any new project  but we are obligated to fund tenant improvements and other capital improvements for projects that were acquired prior to june  
table of contents we estimate we will fund all of the million in our requirement to fund all or a portion of our commitments to the thomas high performance green fund is subject to our identifying properties to acquire that are mutually acceptable to us  and our partners 
our cash requirements for the green fund could be reduced by contributions by us to the fund of assets in which we have an interest 
in december  our board of directors suspended its quarterly dividends to common stockholders 
the availability of funds to pay dividends is impacted by property level restrictions on cash flows 
with respect to our joint venture properties  we do not solely control decision making with respect to these properties  and may not be able to obtain monies from these properties even if funds are available for distribution to us 
in addition  we may enter future financing arrangements that contain restrictions on our use of cash generated from our properties 
the payment of cash dividends in the future  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon such factors as earnings levels  capital requirements  our overall financial condition  and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
development and redevelopment projects we own interests in four development projects  and our joint venture with calstrs owns four redevelopment properties and two development sites 
we anticipate seeking to mitigate our development risk on all of our development projects by obtaining significant pre leasing and guaranteed maximum cost construction contracts 
there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these risk mitigation measures 
we substantially completed construction in of the murano  a unit high rise residential condominium project in downtown philadelphia 
we entered into contracts for units and parking spaces  and recognized a gain on sale of approximately million for the year ended december  due to the deteriorating market conditions in the second half of  we recorded an million non cash impairment charge during the three months ended december  during the year ended december   we entered into contracts for units and parking spaces  had twelve forfeitures and recognized a gain on sale of approximately million 
of the twelve forfeitures  eleven related to prior year sales and one related to a sale  which was resold to a new buyer during subsequent to december   we signed contracts for ten additional units 
we recorded a million non cash impairment charge for the year ended december  on the murano based on our estimation of future absorption and sales prices 
murano is classified as condominium units held for sale on our balance sheets 
the amount and timing of costs associated with our development and redevelopment projects is inherently uncertain due to market and economic conditions 
we presently intend to fund development and redevelopment expenditures primarily through construction or refurbishment financing 
construction of the murano was financed in part with a construction loan up to million 
repayment of this loan is being made with proceeds from the sales of condominium units 
the loan has a balance of million as of december  subsequent to december   we closed on the sale of four units and we have eleven units under contract and expected to close  which will cumulatively reduce the principal balance by approximately million 
we are in discussions with the lender to extend the loan maturity to  which based on the principal amortization feature of the loan  we believe is achievable 
if we are unable to extend or refinance the loan  the lender could repossess the unsold units through foreclosure  which would result in an additional non cash impairment charge 
we have no guarantees on this debt other than the payment of interest through the maturity date 
we do not earn any fee revenue from this project 
the completed core and shell construction of two office buildings at our development site at four points centre was financed in part with a construction loan  which has an outstanding balance as of december  of million with additional borrowing capacity of million to fund tenant improvements and other project costs 
on october   the four points centre construction loan 
table of contents was extended to july  with two one year extension options subject to certain conditions 
we have committed to pay down the principal amount of the loan in the total amount of million of which we paid million in october   million in january  and we will pay the balance in two equal installments  in june and december  in addition  we paid million in june which was held by the lender to fund any remaining project costs 
as of december   these funds have been fully disbursed 
the interest rate on the loan has been increased to libor plus per annum 
we have guaranteed all of the required principal payments due in of million after the million payment we made in january and of the balance of the outstanding principal  interest and any other sum payable under this loan 
after the remaining million principal reductions we will make in  the outstanding balance will be million  which results in a maximum guarantee amount based on of million 
we also provided additional collateral of approximately acres of fully entitled unimproved land  which is immediately adjacent to our four points centre office buildings 
presently  we have not obtained construction financing for the development at campus el segundo 
if we finance development projects through construction loans and are unable to obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms or at all  we would need to fund these obligations from cash flow from operations or seek alternative capital sources 
if unsuccessful  this could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 
if we are successful in obtaining construction or refurbishment financing and permanent financing  we anticipate that the corresponding interest costs would represent both a significant use of our cash flow and a material component of our results of operations 
we are also involved in managing the following three entitlement projects we are presently entitling approximately acres in los angeles  california  for office  production facility  residential and retail uses 
the project  called metro studio lankershim  will include up to million square feet 
upon completion of entitlements  we expect to enter into a long term ground lease with the los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority  which owns the land 
we have been engaged by nbc universal to entitle  master plan and develop subject to our right of first offer acres located adjacent to universal city in los angeles for the development of a residential and retail town center commonly referred to as universal village 
we anticipate completing the development of these projects as market feasibility permits 
korean air  a subsidiary of hanjin group  has retained us as fee developer for the entitlement  design and redevelopment of the acre wilshire grand property in downtown los angeles 
the wilshire grand project envisions the development of two buildings  one approximately stories and the other approximately stories  to include approximately million square feet of office  hotel rooms  and residential condominiums  with supporting retail and restaurant uses  for a total project size of up to approximately million gross square feet 
leasing  tenant improvement and capital needs in addition to our development and redevelopment projects  our one commerce square and two commerce square properties require routine capital maintenance in the ordinary course of business 
the properties also require that we incur expenditures for leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs 
the level of these expenditures varies from year to year based on several factors  including lease expirations 
we are contractually committed to incur expenditures of approximately million in capital improvements  tenant improvements  and leasing commissions for the one commerce square and two commerce square properties  collectively  during through annual capital expenditures may fluctuate in response to the nature  extent and timing of improvements required to maintain our properties 
tenant improvements and leasing costs may also fluctuate depending upon other factors  including the type of property involved  the existing tenant base  terms of leases  types of leases  the involvement of leasing agents and overall market conditions

subsequent to december   we closed on the sale of four units and we have eleven units under contract and expected to close  which will cumulatively reduce the principal balance by approximately million

the balance of the loan as of december  was million 
as of december   of our debt was at contractually fixed rates

the remaining of our debt bears interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread that ranges from to 
the interest payments on the variable rate debt have not been reported in the table above because we cannot reasonably determine the future interest obligations on our variable rate debt as we cannot predict what libor rates will be in the future 
as of december   the one month libor was

the table does not reflect available extension options 
the obligations associated with uncertain tax provisions under fasb asc in the table above should represent amounts associated with uncertain tax positions related to temporary differences 
however  reasonable estimates cannot be made about the amount and timing of payment  if any  for these obligations 
as of december   million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fasb asc  and we are uncertain as to if and when such amounts may be settled 
included within the unrecognized tax benefits is million of accrued interest 
we have not recorded any penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits

under certain circumstances all of the exit fees will be waived 
subsequent to december   we negotiated on behalf of calstrs  our partner in city national plaza  for calstrs to acquire all of the property s mezzanine debt  which has a principal balance of approximately million  and is scheduled to mature on july  calstrs acquired this debt and will contribute it to the partnership s equity  reducing the leverage on the property from million to million  all of which is first mortgage debt 
we are in discussions with calstrs to obtain an option to participate in the loan purchase  on or after the maturity of the mezzanine debt  based on our current pro rata share of of the existing city national plaza equity 
we are in discussions with lenders to refinance the senior mortgage loan 
we believe there is sufficient equity in this project to achieve a refinancing 
if tpg calstrs is unable to extend or refinance this loan  the lender could repossess the property through foreclosure  which would result in a non cash impairment charge  potential loss of distributable cash flow and a loss of fee revenue for us 
the partnership that owns each property has purchased interest rate cap agreements for the funded portion of these loans 
this loan has a one year extension option remaining at our election 
these loans are subject to exit fees equal to of the loan amounts  however  under certain circumstances the exit fees will be waived 
these loans bear interest at the greater of the one month libor or per annum  plus the applicable margin 
as of december   one month libor is below  per annum 
this loan is secured by both a subordinate lien on the property and a payment guaranty issued by the special purpose entity which owns oak hill plaza walnut hill plaza 
a subsidiary of tpg calstrs the borrower was unable to repay the loan by the maturity date of march  and therefore  the loan is in default 
pending a resolution of the loan default  either through a restructure of the debt  a sale or other transfer of the properties or the appointment of a receiver  we expect that we will continue to manage the properties pursuant to our management agreement with the borrower 
the management and leasing agreement expired on march   and is automatically renewed for successive periods of one year each  unless we elect not to renew the agreement 
due to the maturity date default  the lender has the authority to terminate us as the property manager 
if the borrower is unable to extend or refinance this loan  the lender could repossess the property through foreclosure  which would result in a loss of fee revenue for us

during  the austin portfolio joint venture entered into an interest rate collar agreement for million  in which it bought a cap and sold a floor 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with lehman brothers holdings inc to terminate the interest rate collar agreement for tpg austin portfolio holdings llc 
the company settled this obligation with the lehman affiliate on january  the margin above libor on the bank term loan is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the term loan is secured by mortgages on three of the austin portfolio joint venture properties and a pledge of equity interests in the remaining seven austin portfolio joint venture properties 
these mortgage liens and equity pledges also secure the austin senior secured priority facility  which has a priority right to repayment ahead of the austin portfolio bank term loan 
during  tpg austin portfolio holdings lp entered into agreements pursuant to which i an existing million revolving loan was terminated  ii a senior secured priority facility of million was established which a subsidiary of tpg calstrs agreed to fund on a pari passu basis with affiliates of lehman brothers and a sovereign wealth fund that are partners in the austin portfolio joint venture  and iii the venture purchased and retired million of the austin portfolio bank term loan at a discount to face value  reducing that loan from million to million

table of contents during the year ended december  and a decrease of million related to the payment of dividends to common stockholders and distributions to limited partners of the operating partnership 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  and million as of december  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of an increase in net loss of million attributable to the company  gain on sale of murano condominiums of million  a decrease of million in accounts payable and other liabilities and a decrease in deferred rents of million primarily due to lease expirations for conrail

the decreases were offset by million related to payments for the redemption of operating units in inflation substantially all of our office leases provide for tenants to reimburse us for increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses related to the leased space at the applicable property 
in addition  many of the leases provide for increases in fixed base rent 
we believe that inflationary increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense reimbursements as described above 
we have one multi family residential rental property  which is located in the philadelphia central business district and subject to short term leases 
inflationary increases can often be offset by increased rental rates  however  a weak economic environment may restrict our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk faced by our company is interest rate risk 
our strategy is to match as closely as possible the expected holding periods and income streams of our assets with the terms of our debt 
in general  we use floating rate debt on assets with higher growth prospects and less stability to their income streams 
correspondingly  with respect to stabilized assets with lower growth rates  we will generally use longer term fixed rate debt 
as of december   our company had million of outstanding consolidated floating rate debt  which is not subject to an interest rate cap 
the unconsolidated real estate entities have total debt of billion  of which billion bears interest at floating rates 
as of december   interest rate caps have been purchased for billion of the floating rate loans 

table of contents our fixed and variable rate consolidated long term debt at december  consisted of the following in thousands year of maturity fixed rate variable rate total thereafter total weighted average interest rate we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on interest costs of our variable rate debt 
at december   our variable rate long term debt represents of our total long term debt 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  or by approximately of the weighted average variable rate at december   the net impact would be increased interest costs of million per year 
our estimates of the fair value of debt instruments at december  and  respectively  were determined by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market discount rate 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop the estimated fair value 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts
