table of contents non gaap measure adjusted ebitda the following table provides information regarding our adjusted ebitda  including a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda  for the last three fiscal years in thousands fiscal year net loss amortization of intangible assets amortization of non cash marketing stock based compensation depreciation interest income  net adjusted ebitda to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we use the non gaap measure of adjusted ebitda  defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization of intangible assets and non cash marketing expenses  adjusted to exclude the impact of stock based compensation expense 
this non gaap measure is provided to enhance the user s overall understanding of the company s current financial performance 
management believes that adjusted ebitda  as defined  provides useful information to the company and to investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results 
in addition  because we have historically provided adjusted ebitda measures to investors  management believes that including adjusted ebitda measures provides consistency in the our financial reporting 
however  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for  or as superior to  net income loss  cash flows  or other consolidated income loss or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
although adjusted ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operating performance  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation 
net income loss is the closest financial measure prepared by us in accordance with gaap in terms of comparability to adjusted ebitda 
significant accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
significant accounting policies are included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions  and judgments are reasonable  they are based on information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments  or conditions 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered including advertising revenues  net of sales tax  when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price or fee earned is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents otc vision  and mail order 
we record revenues from sales of otc  vision  and mail order pharmacy when the products are shipped and title passes to customers  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates  and returns allowances 
we generally require payment by credit card at the point of sale 
we estimate return allowances  which reduce product sales by our estimate of expected product returns  based on our historical experience 
historically  product returns have not been significant and have not differed significantly from our estimates 
prescription sales 
for insured prescriptions in our mail order segment  the co payment and the insurance reimbursement which together make up the amount due to drugstore 
com constitute the full value of the prescription drug sale  and we receive this entire amount as cash 
we therefore recognize the entire amount as revenue when we ship the order to the customer 
from time to time  we provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases 
such offers include discounts on specific current purchases  or future rebates based on a percentage of the current purchase  as well as other offers 
we treat discounts  when our customers accept them  as a reduction in the sales price of the related transaction  and we present them as a net amount in net sales 
we treat rebates as a reduction in the sales price based on estimated redemption rates 
we estimate redemption rates using our historical experience for similar offers 
historically  our redemption rates have not differed materially from our estimates  which we adjust quarterly 
generally  when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction  are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  or have several but not all of these indicators  we record revenue on a gross basis 
if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage  a fixed payment schedule  or a combination of the two  we record revenue on a net basis 
consignment and drop ship arrangements 
we record revenues generated by consignment arrangements with gnc  rite aid and medco in our otc segment on a net basis because we do not take title to the inventory and do not establish pricing 
we record revenues generated from our drop ship arrangements with vendors in our otc segment on a gross basis when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction  are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  or have several but not all of these indicators 
strategic partnerships 
we record revenues generated from the amazon 
com marketplace in our otc segment on a gross basis  because we act as a principal  based on the fact that we are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers 
we record revenues generated by the weil agreement in our otc segment on a net basis  because we act as an agent  based on the fact that we earn a fixed dollar amount per customer transaction regardless of the amount billed to the customer  and we do not bear general inventory risk associated with these sales 
we record revenues generated from the medco and rite aid online stores in our otc segment on a gross basis  because we act as a principal  based on the fact that we are subject to inventory and credit risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers 
medco and rite aid earn a percentage of the contribution margin  defined as net sales  less direct costs of these sales and the incremental cost of fulfilling  processing and delivering the order  from the medco and rite aid online stores  respectively  which we record in marketing and sales expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables we evaluate the following criteria that must be met in order for the deliverables in the arrangement to be treated as separate units of accounting  the delivered item has value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
when the separation criteria are not met  the delivered item is accounted for as a combined unit of accounting with the undelivered item 
therefore  revenue for the delivered and undelivered items are recognized over the service period of the last delivered item or if it is not a service  when the last item is delivered 

table of contents inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust our inventories for shrinkage and slow moving  damaged  and expired inventory  which we record as the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on management s assumptions about future demand for the products we offer and market conditions 
we use a variety of methods to reduce the quantity of slow moving inventory  including reducing sales prices on our websites  negotiating returns to vendors  and liquidating inventory through third parties 
if our estimates of future product demand or our assumptions about market conditions are inaccurate  we could understate or overstate the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
historically  inventory write downs have not differed materially from our estimates 
goodwill  indefinite lived and other intangible assets we test for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived assets during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever indicators of impairment occur 
the first phase of the test screens for impairment  while the second phase of the test if necessary measures the amount of impairment 
the first phase is performed by comparing the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value is determined using either a discounted cash flow methodology or methodology based on comparable market prices 
the second step of the asset impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit asset with the carrying amount of that asset 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit asset exceeds the implied fair value of that asset  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
during fiscal  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units by preparing a discounted cash flow analysis using forward looking projections of our estimated future operating results 
based on the results of the discounted cash flow analysis  we concluded that the fair value exceeds the carrying value  and therefore goodwill is not impaired 
we also considered as an indicator of market value the market value of our common stock during the fourth quarter 
the significant assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis included projected operating results  the discount rate used to present value future cash flows  and capital expenditures 
projected operating results assumptions include sales growth assumptions which are based on historical trends  and to a lesser extent  future sales growth from new strategic partnerships or initiatives 
also included in projected operating results are gross margin and operating cost growth assumptions which are based on historical relationship of those measures compared to sales 
our discount rate is a market participant weighted average cost of capital wacc 
our capital expenditure assumptions are based on our planned capital expenditures for existing and new projects 
sensitivity tests were performed on our significant assumptions and determined that a reasonable  negative change in assumptions would not impact our conclusions 
we review the carrying values of our amortized long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  whenever an indicator of impairment exists 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  we perform an evaluation of recoverability 
the determination of whether impairment exists is based on any excess of the carrying value over the expected future cash flows  as estimated through undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges 
any resulting impairment charge would be measured based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  as estimated through expected future discounted cash flows  discounted at a rate of return for an alternate investment 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation cost over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we calculate the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees using the black scholes option pricing model using 
table of contents the single option approach 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock 
the fair value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line method 
we base our computation of expected volatility on our historical volatility  adjusted for changes in capital structure and corporate changes  information available that may indicate future volatility  and observable mean reversion tendencies of historical volatility 
our expected term estimates are based on a comprehensive weighted average life wal analysis 
the wal analysis provides a historical based platform for use in developing expected term estimates for the future based on the historically observed time periods from grant date through post vesting activities  such as exercise and cancellation 
we base the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
where the expected term of our stock based awards does not correspond with the terms for which interest rates are quoted  we average the rates quoted for the closest available term maturities 
a dividend yield of is considered appropriate as we have not issued and do not anticipate issuing any dividends in the near future 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider historical voluntary termination behavior in addition to actual option forfeitures 
in conjunction with this analysis  we identified distinct subgroups non management employees  management employees  our chief executive officer  board members  and other non employees 
we apply an estimated forfeiture rate to employee subgroups  based on the weighted average termination behavior of those subgroups 
if our estimated forfeiture rate changes  we retrospectively increase or decrease stock based compensation in the period of change 
any such revisions to the estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our stock based awards could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see note of our consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  included in part iv  item of this annual report 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates 
any such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
for example  in april  we reached a resolution with the state of new jersey  regarding sales and use taxes owed by us for the years to  pursuant to which we paid an aggregate of approximately million in full satisfaction of our obligations for those years 
we recognized an expense of million in and a benefit of million in in the statements of operations related to this obligation 
in addition  in may  we reached an agreement with contacts to resolve  without admission of wrongdoing or liability  certain claims brought against us by contacts for a one time payment of  which settlement was included in the statement of operations in for a description of our material legal proceedings  see note of our consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  included in part iv  item of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of our consolidated financial statements  the company and summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements  included in part iv  item of this annual report 
liquidity and capital resources we have an accumulated deficit of million through january  to date  we have had only three profitable quarters  and we may never achieve profitability on a full year or consistent basis 
we expect to incur net losses in the first quarter of  and possibly longer 
from our inception through january   we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including common and preferred stock  yielding net cash proceeds of million 

table of contents our primary source of cash is sales made through our websites  for which we collect cash from credit card settlements  or insurance reimbursements 
our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  salaries  marketing expenses  and overhead and fixed costs 
any projections of our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty for the reasons discussed in this section and in the section entitled risk factors  in part i  item a of this annual report 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
historically  our principal liquidity requirements have been to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
until required for other purposes  our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in deposit accounts or highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
our marketable securities  which include commercial paper  us government agency obligations  and corporate notes and bonds  are considered short term as they are available to fund current operations 
in addition  we have a revolving two year line of credit allowing for borrowings of up to million in the aggregate through march  which is available to fund operations  capital expenditures  or finance acquisitions  as needed 
as of january   the aggregate available borrowings under the line of credit were approximately million 
on february   we completed our acquisition of salu 
see note subsequent events  included in part iv  item of this annual report 
in connection with this acquisition  we financed a portion of the cash payable at the closing of the merger and therefore borrowed million under our revolving two year line of credit  which accrues interest at the higher of the prime rate plus at february   or  effectively reducing the available borrowings under our line of credit to million 
we believe that our cash and marketable securities on hand plus our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  any projections about our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
as a result  we may need to raise additional monies to fund our operating activities or for strategic flexibility if  for example  we decide to pursue business or technology acquisitions or if our expectations regarding our operations and anticipated capital expenditures change 
we have assessed in the past  and will continue to assess  opportunities for raising additional funds by selling equity  equity related or debt securities  obtaining additional credit facilities  or obtaining other means of financing for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms when required  or at all 
furthermore  if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of securities  such securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
discussion of cash flows the following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the last three fiscal years in thousands fiscal year net cash provided by used in continuing operating activities discontinued operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by used in operating activities 
our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers  fulfillment partners  and advertising and other service revenue  offset by cash payments we make for products and services  employee compensation  payment processing and related transaction costs  and interest payments on our long term debt obligations 
cash received from customers and 
table of contents other activities generally corresponds to our net sales  and because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us  our receivables from customers settle quickly 
working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables  including seasonality  inventory management and category expansion  the timing of cash receipts and payments  vendor payment terms  and valuation of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in  net cash provided by continuing operations reflects non cash expenses of million  partially offset by a loss from continuing operations of million  and uses of working capital of million primarily due to increased inventories of million to support growth in net sales and increased receivables of million due to timing of receipts  partially offset by the timing of payments to our vendors of million 
in  net cash provided by continuing operations reflects non cash expenses of million  offset by a loss from continuing operations of million  and uses of working capital of million primarily due the timing of payments to vendors and slight increase in inventory  partially offset by a decrease in receivables and other assets 
in  net cash used by continuing operations reflects a loss from continuing operations of million and uses of working capital of million  offset by non cash expenses of million 
net cash provided by continuing operations in the increased million compared  primarily from a million decrease in the loss from continuing operations  partially offset by an increase of million in cash used for working capital purposes and lower non cash expenses of million resulting from lower stock based compensation  partially offset by higher depreciation expense 
net cash provided by continuing operations in the increased million compared  primarily from a million decrease in the loss from continuing operations and a million increase in non cash expenses  partially offset by an increase of million in cash used for working capital purposes 
non cash expenses increased year over year in as a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation 
net cash provided by discontinued operations in decreased by million compared to  as a result of the final settlement of assets and liabilities held by our discontinued lpu business in upon the sale to rite aid 
net cash provided by discontinued operations in increased million compared to as a result of the timing of payments and collections of accounts receivable of our assets and liabilities held by our discontinued lpu business 
cash used in investing activities 
our net cash flows from investing activities include the purchase of marketable securities and the acquisition of fixed assets and intangible assets  partially offset by the net proceeds received from the sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations 
in  net cash used in investing activities reflects the purchase of marketable securities of million and the purchase of fixed assets and intangible assets of million  partially offset by the million of cash proceeds received from the sale of the lpu business and million from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
in  net cash used in investing activities reflects the purchase of marketable securities of million and the purchase of fixed assets of million  partially offset by the million of cash proceeds received from the sale of the lpu business and million from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
in  net cash used in investing activities reflects the purchase of marketable securities of million and the purchase of fixed assets and intangible assets of million  partially offset by million from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities has decreased slightly year over year in and  compared to the prior years  primarily as a result of a decrease in the purchase of fixed assets and intangible assets each year  offset by the proceeds received from the sale of discontinued operations 
in  we anticipate our capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
cash provided by used in financing activities 
our net cash flows from financing activities represent cash provided from borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit to fund capital expenditures and operations  and the exercise of options and warrants  and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by payments on our debt obligations 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities increased by million in compared to cash provided by financing activities in  primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from borrowings under our revolving line of credit of million  an increase in payments on debt obligations of million  and a decrease in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan of million primarily due to the expiring of the employee stock purchase plan in june net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million in compared to  due to a decrease in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of million due to our lower average stock price  partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our revolving line of credit of million used to fund operations and capital expenditures  and a decrease in payments on debt obligations of million 
contractual obligations and commitments in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with our existing bank 
this agreement includes a revolving two year line of credit allowing for borrowings up to million  which accrue interest at the higher of prime rate plus at january   or for general corporate purposes  including short term working capital needs  and to finance certain potential acquisitions  should we elect to pursue any in the future 
the agreement allows for the conversion of up to million of the outstanding balance into a term loan  payable in monthly installments of principal and interest at a rate equal to the greater of a the prime rate plus or b 
advances available under the revolving line of credit are limited  based on eligible inventory  accounts receivable  and cash and investment balances  and balances outstanding under our existing term loan 
in the third quarter of  we paid off the existing term loan and borrowed approximately million on the revolving line of credit under this facility  which was outstanding as of january  in addition  availability under the line of credit was reduced by a  letter of credit we provided to our landlord 
accordingly  the available borrowings under the line of credit were approximately million at january  in february  we financed a portion of the cash payable at the closing of the merger of salu and therefore borrowed million under our revolving two year line of credit  effectively reducing the available borrowings under our line of credit to million 
the agreement contains certain covenants that are customary in transactions of this nature  including a prohibition on other debt and liens  requirements regarding the payment of taxes  and certain restrictions on mergers and acquisitions  investments  and transactions with our affiliates  as well as certain financial covenants related to our cash and cash equivalents and our free cash flow  which we were in compliance with as of january  the agreement identifies certain events of default that are customary for transactions of this nature and subject to materiality provisions and grace periods where appropriate  including failure to pay any principal or interest under this facility or other instruments when due  the occurrence of a material adverse change  violations of any covenants  a material cross default to our other debt  or a change of control 
as of january   none of these events had occurred 
the balance outstanding on our term loan under our previous agreement with our existing bank  which was replaced by the agreement above  totaled million as of december   and there was no balance outstanding under the line of credit as of december  we also lease computer equipment under non cancelable capital leases 
capital lease obligations bear interest at approximately and mature months from the date of funding 
we secured additional funds of  during and  during  through capital lease financing agreements  through which we financed certain computer equipment and software for periods of two years 
we are in compliance with all covenants required by these agreements 
we lease office  distribution center  and call center facilities under non cancelable operating leases  which include fixed rental payments ending between and we have the option to extend some of these leases for one or two additional terms of five years 
in addition  we lease various office and it equipment under operating leases 
in december  we entered into an agreement to extend our operating lease for our primary distribution facility located in swedesboro  new jersey  where we lease approximately  square feet 
under the terms of the amended agreement  the lease will expire in december  with options to renew for 
table of contents two additional five year periods  if exercised  would extend the lease expiration to december in august  we entered into an operating lease for approximately  square feet for our corporate headquarters 
the lease expires on july   with two separate five year renewal options that  if exercised  would extend the lease expiration to july as of january   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under capital and operating leases and our line of credit  as follows in thousands payment due by period total years capital leases line of credit operating leases capital lease obligations consist primarily of technology and operations assets 
line of credit includes our borrowings on our line of credit with our bank due in march and excludes approximately million that we borrowed in connection with our acquisition of salu  inc on february  operating lease obligations consist of office building  distribution center  and call center leases 
we do not have any future material noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
management outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year  we are targeting net sales in the range of million to million 
we anticipate net loss for the first quarter in the range of million to million  and adjusted ebitda in the range of million to million 
this outlook assumes an estimated million to million of net sales generated by salu after the closing of the acquisition  as well as million of transaction and integration related expenses 
these projections are subject to substantial uncertainty

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  capital lease obligations  and cash and cash equivalents 
due to the short term nature of these investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments is not material to us 
our financing facilities expose our net earnings to changes in short term interest rates because interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
borrowings outstanding under the variable interest bearing financing facilities totaled million at january   excluding approximately million that we borrowed in connection with our acquisition of salu  inc on february   and the highest interest rate attributable to this outstanding balance was at january  a change in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
we have investment risk exposure arising from our investments in marketable securities due to volatility of the bond market in general  company specific circumstances  and changes in general economic conditions 
as of january   we had million of securities classified as marketable securities 
we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary
