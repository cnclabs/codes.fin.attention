item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that follow in this annual report on form k 
overview historically  our quantitative radio ratings services and related software have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue 
our radio audience ratings services and the related software revenues represented percent  percent  and percent of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
while we expect that our quantitative radio ratings services and related software will continue to account for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future  we are actively seeking opportunities to diversify our revenue base by  among other things  leveraging the investment we have made in our ppm technology by exploring applications of the technology beyond our domestic radio ratings business 
we are in the process of executing our previously announced plan to commercialize progressively our ppm radio ratings service in the largest united states radio markets  which we currently anticipate will result in commercialization of the service in local markets by december according to our analysis of bia s investing in radio market report  those broadcasters with whom we have entered into multi year ppm agreements account for most of the total radio advertising dollars in the ppm markets 
these agreements generally provide for a higher fee for ppm based ratings than we charge for diary based ratings 
as a result  we expect that the percentage of our revenues derived from our radio ratings and related software is likely to increase as we commercialize the ppm service 
growth in revenue is expected for due to a full year impact of revenue recognized for the ppm markets commercialized prior to  as well as the partial year impact related to the ppm markets scheduled for commercialization during the latter half of however  the full revenue impact of the launch of each ppm market is not expected to occur within the first year after commercialization because our customer contracts allow for phased in pricing toward the higher ppm service rate over a period of time 
nielsen s signing of cumulus and clear channel as customers for its radio ratings service in certain small to mid sized markets resulted in a million negative impact on revenue we would have received for the year ended december   and is anticipated to adversely impact our expected revenue by approximately million per year thereafter 
due to the impact of the current economic downturn on anticipated sales of discretionary services and renewals of agreements to provide ratings services  as well as the high penetration of our current services in the radio broadcasting business  we expect that our future annual organic rate of revenue growth from our quantitative diary based radio ratings services will be slower than historical trends 
we depend on a limited number of key customers for our radio ratings services and related software 
for example  in  clear channel represented percent of our total revenue 
we cannot provide any assurances that we could replace the revenue that would be lost if any of our key customers failed to renew all or part of their agreements with us or became insolvent 
the loss of any key customer would materially impact our business  financial position  and operating results 
because many of our largest customers own and operate radio stations in markets that we expect to transition to ppm measurement  we expect that our dependence on our largest customers will continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that ppm costs and expenses will accelerate six to nine months in advance of the commercialization of the service in each ppm market as we build the panels 
these costs are incremental to the costs associated with our diary based ratings service 
in addition  we expect to increase the percentage of cell phone only households in both the diary and ppm services  which we expect will increase our annual cost of revenue 
we continue to operate in a highly challenging business environment 
our future performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and industries we serve 
such challenges and opportunities include our ability to continue to maintain and improve the quality of our ppm service  and manage increased costs for data collection  arising from  among other things  increased numbers of cell phone only households  which are more expensive for us to recruit than are households with landline telephones 
our goal is to obtain and or maintain mrc accreditation in all of our ppm markets  and develop and implement effective and efficient technological solutions to measure cross platform media and advertising 
protecting and supporting our existing customer base  and ensuring our services are competitive from a price  quality and service perspective are critical components to these overall goals  although there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts 
restructuring  reorganization and expense reduction plan during the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring  reorganization  and expense reduction plan the plan 
part of the plan included reducing our full time workforce by approximately percent 
during  we incurred restructuring charges  related principally to severance  termination benefits  retirement plan settlement charges  outplacement support and certain other expenses that were incurred as part of the plan 
in accordance with our retirement plan provisions  participants may elect  at their option  to receive their retirement benefits either in a lump sum payment or an annuity 
if the lump sum distributions paid during the year exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the retirement plan year  we must recognize for that year s results of operations the pro rata portion of any unrecognized gain or loss equal to the percentage reduction of the projected benefit obligation 
during  the aggregate of lump sum distribution elections by a number of pension plan participants who were terminated as part of the plan  resulted in the recognition of a non cash charge for the settlement related to two of the company s retirement plans 
for the year ended december   we incurred non cash settlement charges of million and a total restructuring charge  including the non cash settlement charges  of million 
investment in tra we made a million minority investment in preferred stock of tra in may we account for our investment in tra using the cost method of accounting  which requires a measurement of the fair market value fmv of the investment in order to determine if an impairment of the asset has occurred 
we believe the carrying value of tra approximates its fmv 
tra s shares are not publicly traded  which makes it difficult to ascertain its fmv 
however  tra is currently engaged in raising additional capital  which it has indicated to us it expects to complete in the first half of we will re evaluate the value of our investment based on the results of the capital raise 
legal expenses during and  we incurred approximately million in aggregate legal costs and expenses in connection with two securities law civil actions and a governmental interaction  relating primarily to the commercialization of our ppm radio ratings service 
for additional information regarding the company s legal interactions  see item legal proceedings 
as of december   we received million in insurance reimbursements related to these legal actions and estimated that an additional million of the aggregate costs and expenses were probable for recovery under our director and officer insurance policy 
during the first quarter of  we received million from our director and officer insurance carrier and we reached a settlement for million  which we also expect to receive during the first quarter of we are also involved in other legal matters for which we do not expect that the legal costs and expenses will be recoverable through insurance 
we can provide no assurance that we will not continue to incur legal costs and expenses at comparable or higher levels in the future 
for further information regarding these legal costs  see critical accounting policies and estimates 
general economic conditions our customers derive most of their revenue from transactions involving the sale or purchase of advertising 
during recent challenging economic times  advertisers have reduced advertising expenditures  impacting advertising agencies and media 
as a result  advertising agencies and media companies have been and may continue to be less likely to purchase our services  which has and could continue to adversely impact our business  financial position  and operating results 
since september  we have experienced an increase in the average number of days our sales have been outstanding before we have received payment  which has resulted in a material increase in trade accounts receivable as compared to historical trends 
our accounts receivable remained at this elevated level throughout  however  the increase since december  was not significant 
if the economic downturn expands or is sustained for an extended period into the future  it may also lead to increased incidence of customers inability to pay their accounts  an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts  and a further increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or insolvency of our customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that both are important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations  and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
software development costs 
we capitalize software development costs with respect to significant internal use software initiatives or enhancements from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended  until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are amortized over periods of three to five years 
we perform an assessment quarterly to determine if it is probable that all capitalized software will be used to perform its intended function 
if an impairment exists  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value 
as of december   and  our capitalized software developed for internal use had carrying amounts of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  of software related to the ppm service 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account forecasts of the amount and nature of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and nature of income in future years could render current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets inaccurate 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause actual income tax obligations to differ from estimates  thus impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we include  in our tax calculation methodology  an assessment of the uncertainty in income taxes by establishing recognition thresholds for our tax positions 
inherent in our calculation are critical judgments by management related to the determination of the basis for our tax positions 
for further information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
insurance receivables 
during  we became involved in two securities law civil actions and a governmental interaction primarily related to the commercialization of our ppm service 
during and  we incurred a combined total of million in legal fees and expenses in connection with these matters 
as of december   million in insurance reimbursements related to these legal actions was received 
as of december   and  we estimated that million and million  respectively  of such legal fees and expenses were probable for future receipt under our directors and officers insurance policy 
these amounts are included in our prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet 
during and  we incurred a combined total of million of business interruption losses and damages as a result of hurricane ike 
we estimated that insurance reimbursements for a portion of these expenses were probable for future receipt under our insurance policy 
we recorded million and million  as of december   and  respectively  as an insurance claims receivable and included such estimates within our prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet 
as of december   approximately million in insurance reimbursements were received

revenue 
revenue increased or million for the year ended december   as compared to revenue increased  in particular  by million due to the partial year impact of the commercialization of ppm markets during  as well as the full year impact of the ppm markets commercialized during higher fees are charged for ppm based ratings than for diary based ratings within the ppm markets commercialized 
the increase in revenue due to ppm market commercialization was largely offset by a million decrease related to the transition from our diary based ratings service 
ppm international sales increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to these net increases were partially offset by a million reduction in revenue associated with two customers  primarily cumulus  inc  for our diary based radio ratings service in a limited number of small and medium sized markets 
the growth rate of our ratings revenue was also diminished due to decreased demand for discretionary services  such as software and qualitative data services  in the currently challenging economic environment 
revenue associated with these two qualitative services decreased by million for the year ended december   as compared to cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to cost of revenue increased due to million of increased ppm service related costs  including million in increased cell phone only household recruitment for our ppm service  incurred to build and manage ppm panels for the ppm markets commercialized in total as of december   as compared to the ppm markets commercialized as of december  in addition  we spent million on cell phone only household recruitment initiatives for our diary service during and million in increased costs incurred during the year ended december   to support the increased infrastructure within our computer center 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in diary data collection and processing costs  excluding diary cell phone only household recruitment  as a result of the transition from our diary service to the ppm service in certain markets  and a million decrease associated with labor cost reductions resulting from our restructuring initiative 
scarborough royalty costs decreased by million for the year ended december   as compared to  due to the decreased demand for discretionary services  such as software and qualitative data services 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expense decreased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to  due primarily to a million decrease related to cost savings incurred as a result of our restructuring and reorganization plan  a million decrease in net legal costs and a million decrease in employee incentive compensation expense 
these decreases in selling  general  and administrative expense were partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of million  a million insurance recovery reversal associated with an insurance claim settlement for certain legal matters and governmental interactions  and a million increase in our bad debt expense primarily due to the impact of the declining economy for the year ended december   as compared to restructuring and reorganization 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately percent of our full time employees

the effective tax rate on continuing operations was for the year ended december  the effective tax rate decreased from in to in primarily due to a million tax benefit recognized as a result of a favorable state tax ruling received during the fourth quarter of net income 
net income increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily due to the increased revenue associated with our transition to our ppm service  net of costs incurred in our continuing efforts to further build and operate our ppm service panels for the ppm markets commercialized as of december  such efforts include supporting recruitment initiatives aimed at increasing our representation of cell phone only households within our audience ratings services 
net income was favorably impacted by a nonrecurring state net operating loss tax benefit in the amount of million recorded during the fourth quarter of  and net income was adversely impacted by a million insurance recovery reversal associated with an insurance claim settlement for certain legal matters and governmental interactions 
ebit and ebitda 
we believe that presenting ebit and ebitda  both non gaap financial measures  as supplemental information helps investors  analysts and others  if they so choose  in understanding and evaluating our operating performance in some of the same ways that we do because ebit and ebitda exclude certain items that are not directly related to our core operating performance 
we reference these non gaap financial measures in assessing current performance and making decisions about internal budgets  resource allocation and financial goals 
ebit is calculated by deducting interest income from income from continuing operations and adding back interest expense and income tax expense to income from continuing operations 
ebitda is calculated by deducting interest income from income from continuing operations and adding back interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation and amortization to income from continuing operations 
ebit and ebitda should not be considered substitutes either for income from continuing operations  as indicators of our operating performance  or for cash flow  as measures of our liquidity 
in addition  because ebit and ebitda may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

the following table sets forth information with regard to pension settlement costs and expenses recognized for the year ended december  dollars in thousands cost of revenue selling  general  and administrative research and development total costs and expenses revenue 
revenue increased or million for the year ended december   as compared to  due primarily to the commercialization of additional ppm markets during  a full year of currency revenue associated with the houston galveston and philadelphia markets commercialized in the first half of  and increases related to the radio ratings subscriber base  contract renewals  and price escalations in multiyear customer contracts for our ppm service and diary based quantitative rating business 
during the last three years  our efforts to support the commercialization of our ppm ratings service have had a material negative impact on our results of operations 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to the increase in cost of revenue was largely attributable to a million increase associated with our ppm ratings service  which was due primarily to increased costs related to additional markets commercialized in and certain markets expected to be commercialized in the increase in cost of revenue for  as compared to  also includes a million increase in expenses on initiatives in support of our diary rating business 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to  due primarily to a million increase in legal costs  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  related to certain legal matters and governmental interactions  a million increase in marketing efforts mainly related to supporting our ppm service  and a million increase in non cash share based compensation for the year ended december   as compared to  partially offset by a million decrease from cost saving initiatives in our sales and marketing divisions 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased or million during the year ended december   as compared to the decrease in research and development expenses resulted primarily from a million reduction associated with the development of the next generation of our client software  and a million decrease in expenses associated with the development of our accounts receivable and contract management system  largely offset by a million increase related to applications and infrastructure to support our ppm service  a million increase associated with supporting our diary service  and million in increased expenses incurred in expanding our technology operations in india 
equity in net income of affiliates 
equity in net income of affiliates increased by or million due to the termination of the project apollo affiliate in june project apollo losses were reported for four quarters during the year ended december  and only two quarters during interest income 
interest income decreased by or million due to a million decrease in the average aggregate cash and short term investment balance for the year ended december   as compared to interest expense 
interest expense increased by or million due to the interest incurred on average debt of million for the year ended december   as compared to million of average debt outstanding during the interest expense incurred during was primarily related to ongoing credit facility fees and the scheduled amortization of deferred financing costs 
net income 
net income decreased or million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due primarily to our continuing efforts to further build and operate our ppm service panels for markets launched in the third quarter of  including new york  nassau suffolk long island  middlesex somerset union  los angeles  riverside san bernardino  chicago  san francisco  and san jose  and those markets commercialized in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  including atlanta  dallas ft 
worth  washington dc  detroit  and boston 
net income was also negatively impacted by certain lawsuits and governmental interactions occurring in  a portion of which is not expected to be covered by insurance  as well as cost and expenses related to pension settlements recognized under sfas no 
these decreases to net income were partially offset by cost reductions associated with research and development and the termination of the project apollo affiliate  which was operating at a loss 
ebit and ebitda 
we believe that presenting ebit and ebitda  both non gaap financial measures  as supplemental information helps investors  analysts  and others  if they so choose  in understanding and evaluating our operating performance in some of the same manners that we do because ebit and ebitda exclude certain items that are not directly related to our core operating performance

in addition  because ebit and ebitda may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebit decreased by or million for the year ended december   as compared to  due to the same reasons previously mentioned for our decreased net income 
ebitda increased or million because this non gaap financial measure excludes depreciation and amortization  which for  experienced an increasing net trend resulting from higher ppm capital expenditures in  as compared to liquidity and capital resources comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  liquidity indicators as of december  as of december  change cash and cash equivalents working deficit working capital  excluding deferred revenue total long term debt over the last two years  we have relied upon our cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our available revolving credit facility credit facility as needed  to fund our dividends  capital expenditures  contractual obligations  and share repurchases 
we expect that our cash position as of december   cash flow generated from operations  and our credit facility will be sufficient to support our operations for the next to months 
see credit facility for further discussion of the relevant terms of our credit facility 
operating activities 
for the year ended december   the net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily due to million in ebitda  as discussed and reconciled to income from continuing operations in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  partially offset by million in income taxes paid during net cash provided by operating activities also reflects a million decrease related to increased accounts receivable balances resulting from higher billings and from slower collections from our customers in the midst of a declining economy 
as a result  our collection cycle has lengthened and our accounts receivable balance as of december   is higher than our historical trends 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a million increase in equity and other investments related to our million investment in tra in  as compared to our million investment in project apollo during the increase in net cash used in investing activities was also due to a million net cash inflow during the prior year associated with our discontinued operation of continental research  which was sold during see note discontinued operations to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due to several factors 
net cash used in financing activities decreased significantly due to a million decrease related to no stock repurchase activity during  as compared to million in cash used to repurchase our common stock during also  a decrease in net cash used in financing activity for the year ended december   as compared to  related to million in increased bank overdraft payables  which was recorded as a financing activity in as compared to no bank overdraft activity recorded for these decreases in net cash used in financing activities were largely offset by million in net debt activity  which was comprised of a net pay down of million of outstanding obligations under our credit facility in  as compared to million of net borrowings to assist our cash flow from operations with funding our stock repurchase program during net cash used in financing activities also increased due to a decline in our average stock price during the latter half of  which persisted into at a level that caused a substantial number of our stock options to be out of the money during most of this caused a million decrease in stock option exercises during  as compared to comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  liquidity indicators as of december  as of december  change cash and cash equivalents working deficit capital working capital  excluding deferred revenue total long term debt  excluding current portion operating activities 
for the year ended december   the net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily due to million in ebitda  as discussed and reconciled to income from continuing operations in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  and a million increase in accounts payable due largely to increased payables associated with legal services rendered during the fourth quarter of  which were partially offset by million in income taxes paid during  and a million decrease related to increased accounts receivable balances resulting from both higher ppm service billings recorded in conjunction with the commercialization of ppm markets in the latter half of  and slower collections from our customers in the midst of a declining economy 
net cash provided by operating activities also reflects a million decrease related to increased prepaids and other current assets  which consists largely of a million insurance claim receivable recorded in for cost recoveries related to certain legal matters  governmental interactions  and hurricane ike business interruption loss and damages 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to million of net short term investment sales made during no investment purchases or sales activity occurred during prior to the end of  all of our short term investments were sold to help fund the completion of our then authorized million stock repurchase program 
for further information regarding the impact to our consolidated financial statements of our stock repurchase programs  see the discussion of the net financing activities below 
the change in cash flow associated with investing activities was also impacted by a million increase in capital spending in  primarily related to ppm equipment and ppm related software capitalization  as well as machinery and equipment purchased in conjunction with expanding our research and development subsidiary in india 
these cash outflows were partially offset by a million net cash inflow related to our discontinued operation ie  continental research 
see note discontinued operations to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due largely to million in increased net borrowings under our credit facility to assist our cash flow from operations with funding our stock repurchase program in as compared to this decrease in net cash used was partially offset by a reduction in proceeds from stock option exercises resulting primarily from a decrease in our average stock price during the latter half of credit facility on december   we entered into an agreement with a consortium of lenders to provide up to million of financing to us through a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility 
the agreement contains an expansion feature for us to increase the total financing available under the credit facility by up to million to an aggregate of million 
such increased financing would be provided by one or more existing credit facility lending institutions  subject to the approval of the lending banks  and or in combination with one or more new lending institutions  subject to the approval of the credit facility s administrative agent 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to six months as selected by us 
our credit facility contains financial terms  covenants and operating restrictions that potentially restrict our financial flexibility 
the material debt covenants under our credit facility include both a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is a non gaap financial measure equal to the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness  as defined in our credit facility  divided by a contractually defined adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation consolidated ebitda for the trailing twelve month period 
the interest coverage ratio is a non gaap financial measure equal to consolidated ebitda divided by total interest expense 
both ratios are designed as measures of our ability to meet current and future obligations 
the following table presents the actual ratios and their threshold limits as defined by the credit facility as of december  covenant threshold actual maximum leverage ratio minimum interest coverage ratio as of december   based upon these financial covenants  there was no default or limit on our ability to borrow the unused portion of our credit facility 
our credit facility contains customary events of default  including nonpayment and breach covenants 
in the event of default  repayment of borrowings under the credit facility could be accelerated 
our credit facility also contains cross default provisions whereby a default on any material indebtedness  as defined in the credit facility  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding debt and the termination of any unused commitment under the credit facility 
the agreement potentially limits  among other things  our ability to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness  and grant or incur liens on our assets 
under the terms of the credit facility  all of our material domestic subsidiaries  if any  guarantee the commitment 
currently  we do not have any material domestic subsidiaries as defined under the terms of the credit facility 
although we do not believe that the terms of our credit facility limit the operation of our business in any material respect  the terms of the credit facility may restrict or prohibit our ability to raise additional debt capital when needed or could prevent us from investing in other growth initiatives 
our outstanding borrowings decreased from million at december   to million at december  we have been in compliance with the terms of the credit facility since the agreement s inception 
as of february   we had million in outstanding debt under the credit facility 
other liquidity matters on november   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million in shares of our outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices over a period of up to two years 
as of the november expiration date   shares of outstanding common stock had been repurchased under this program for million 
commercialization of our ppm ratings service requires and will continue to require a substantial financial investment 
we believe our cash generated from operations  as well as access to the credit facility  is sufficient to fund such requirements for the next to months 
we anticipate that ppm costs and expenses will accelerate six to nine months in advance of the commercialization of the service in each ppm market as we build the panels 
cell phone only household recruitment initiatives in both the diary and ppm services will also increase our cost of revenue
