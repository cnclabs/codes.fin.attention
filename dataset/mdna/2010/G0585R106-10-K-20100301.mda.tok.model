the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k  particularly under the headings risk factors and forward looking statements 
executive summary background agl is a bermuda based holding company that provides  through its operating subsidiaries  credit protection products to the public finance  infrastructure and structured finance markets in the us as well as internationally 
the company applies its credit underwriting expertise  risk management skills and capital markets experience to develop insurance  reinsurance and credit derivative products 
the company s principal product is a guaranty of principal and interest payments on debt securities issued by governmental entities such as us state or municipal authorities  obligations issued for international infrastructure projects  and abs issued by spes 
the company markets its protection products against principal and interest payment default directly to issuers and underwriters of public finance  infrastructure and structured finance securities as well as directly to investors in such debt obligations 
the company serves various global debt capital markets  although its principal focus is in the us and europe 
debt obligations guaranteed by the company s insurance subsidiaries are generally awarded debt credit ratings that are the same rating as the financial strength rating of the agl subsidiary that has guaranteed that obligation 
as of february   the company s insurance subsidiaries were rated aa or better by s p and a or better by moody s 
on february   at the request of the company  fitch withdrew its insurer financial strength and debt ratings on all of the company s rated subsidiaries 
the company s request had been prompted by fitch s announcement that it is withdrawing its credit ratings on all insured bonds for which it does not provide an underlying assessment of the obligor 
see financial strength ratings below 
on july   the company acquired agmh  and agmh s subsidiaries  including agm  from dexia holdings 
the purchase price paid by the company was million in cash and million common shares of agl at per share 
a portion of the purchase price was financed through a public offering of  agl common shares raising gross proceeds of million and  equity units raising gross proceeds of million 
the agmh acquisition did not include the acquisition of agmh s financial products business 
the financial products companies were transferred to dexia holdings prior to completion of the agmh acquisition 
in addition  as further described under liquidity and capital resources liquidity arrangements with respect to agmh s former financial products business  the company has entered into various agreements with dexia in order to transfer to dexia the credit and liquidity risks associated with agmh s former financial products business 
the agmh acquisition as well as the significant financial distress faced by many of the company s competitors has resulted in the company becoming the market leader in providing financial guaranty insurance since since july   when the agmh acquisition closed  the company has conducted its financial guaranty business on a direct basis from two distinct platforms agm  a financial guaranty insurer that now only underwrites us public finance and global infrastructure 
table of contents business  and agc  a financial guaranty insurer that underwrites us public finance and global infrastructure transactions as well as global structured finance transactions 
business environment and market trends the global financial crisis that began in the us rmbs market in and created one of the worst recessions the us has experienced since has caused a material change in the financial guaranty industry with respect to financial strength  market opportunities and competition 
the financial guaranty industry  along with many other financial institutions  has experienced significant levels of credit and market losses on us rmbs securities  particularly for those institutions that invested in or insured cdos backed by abs containing significant residential mortgage collateral cdos of abs 
these losses and the ensuing erosion of liquidity in global capital markets has resulted in a significantly different business environment and market opportunity for the company starting in and continuing through in particular  since year end  every monoline guarantor rated triple a when the crisis began has been downgraded by at least two of the three major credit rating agencies due to increased actual and forecasted credit losses and the individual company s ability or inability to raise capital in order to maintain their ratings 
furthermore  most of the company s competitors have ceased to write new business  including former market leaders mbia  ambac and fgic  as well as smaller companies such as syncora  cifg  ram reinsurance company ltd 
and bluepoint re limited 
unlike their former competitors  only agc  agm and ag re have been able to retain sufficient ratings to remain active providers of financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance  largely because they substantially avoided insuring cdos of abs 
however  even agl and its subsidiaries had been downgraded by two of the credit rating agencies  principally due to the risk of significant adverse loss development on us rmbs exposures insured by the company 
see financial strength ratings for the current ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
although us economic statistics show some indication that the recession may be over and that housing prices are stabilizing  the financial guaranty market continues to face significant economic uncertainty with respect to credit performance 
unemployment remains high and may take years to return to pre recession levels  which may adversely affect loss experience on rmbs as well as assured guaranty s willingness to consider underwriting new rmbs transactions 
in addition  the sustained economic recession has also affected the credit performance of other markets  including corporate credits included in many of the pooled corporate obligations insured by the company and  more specifically  of trust preferred securities that include subordinated capital and notes issued by banks  mortgage real estate investment trusts and insurance companies 
municipal credits have also experienced increased budgetary stress  as sales and real estate tax related revenues have declined 
the company continues to monitor all of its insured exposures for credit deterioration and its expected losses are expected to change depending on observed performance  revised assumptions used in setting the reserves  economic conditions and other factors 
additionally  actions by state and federal regulatory agencies could result in changes that limit the company s business opportunities 
the current economic environment has also had a significant impact on the demand in both the global structured finance and international infrastructure finance markets for financial guaranties  and it is uncertain when or if demand for financial guaranties will return 
also limited new issuance activity in those markets for asset classes in which the company was previously active 
as a result  near term opportunities for financial guaranties in these two markets are largely in secondary markets 
the company expects that global structured finance issuance will increase in the future as the global economy recovers 
for instance  financial guaranties had been an essential component of capital markets financings for international infrastructure projects  but these financings have been largely financed with relatively short term bank loans since the onset of the credit crisis 
the company expects 
table of contents that its international infrastructure opportunities will increase as the global economic environment stabilizes and issuers return to the public markets for financings and that institutional investors will utilize financial guaranties again 
management believes market participants value the company s underwriting skills and surveillance functions as well as the value of its financial guaranties 
similarly  much asset based lending  such as for auto loans and leases and equipment financings  has been financed by banks rather than in the capital markets due to the limited demand for these types of structured financings by investors in the face of the credit crisis 
as liquidity and investor demand increases for structured financings  the company expects to find more opportunities to guaranty those transactions that meet the company s current credit underwriting and risk management guidelines 
unlike the structured finance and international infrastructure markets  however  demand for the company s financial guaranties has continued to be strong in the us public finance market 
in  the company insured of all new us municipal issuance based on par written 
the business has succeeded in part due to the lack of financially strong competitors 
the competitive environment for the financial guaranty industry has changed substantially over the last two years  principally due to the downgrades of virtually all other competing financial guarantors and the relatively limited activity of new financial guaranty companies 
since the credit crisis  only one new triple a financial guarantor  berkshire hathaway assurance corporation  has been formed  but it has underwritten only a limited amount of financial guaranty contracts on new issue municipal bonds 
another potential start up financial guarantor  municipal and infrastructure assurance corporation  was formed in october but has not written any business 
mbia launched a new municipal finance only company  national public finance guarantee corporation  however  it has yet to write any significant new business  possibly because of its comparatively low financial strength ratings and pending litigation surrounding its organization 
in addition  ambac has terminated its effort to launch a municipal only company 
other potential competitors  such as a federally chartered bond insurer or one funded by states and pension funds  remain in the discussion stage 
management believes that its us public finance activity also demonstrates inherent  sustainable demand for high quality bond insurance in the municipal market  given the structure of the municipal market and its reliance  directly and indirectly  on individual rather than institutional investors 
few individual or even institutional investors have the analytic resources to cover all the varied municipal credits in the market  which are estimated to number more than  by guaranteeing principal and interest  the company effectively consolidates the tasks of credit selection  analysis  structuring  monitoring and  if necessary  remediation of credit issues that may arise 
management believes this allows retail investors to participate more widely  institutional investors to operate more efficiently and smaller  less well known issuers to gain market access 
management believes these features of financial guaranty insurance are an important part of the company s value proposition  in addition to the company s ability to reduce interest costs by enhancing each issue s credit rating 
as a result  on a sale date basis  excluding issuances under the babs program discussed below  agc and agm guaranteed a combined total of billion of us new issue municipal bonds  out of the total of billion of new public finance bonds sold during  or approximately of such new issuance  according to the sdc thomson municipal database 
however  despite the company s significant level of activity in the us municipal market  the downgrade of the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries by two out of the three credit rating agencies has resulted in lessened demand for the company s insurance in certain sectors of the public finance market 
despite the lack of active financial guarantor competitors  the company faces competition for credit enhancement on municipal bonds from other types of competition 
for instance  the use of letters of credit provided by banks for credit enhancement of municipal bonds 
in addition  the federal government s babs program  which was launched in april and is currently authorized through december  had some impact on demand for financial guaranties from the company in approximately billion of new issue municipal bonds were sold under the babs program in  
table of contents but only billion were insured by assured guaranty 
the company believes that the taxable buyers of the babs bonds were generally less likely to purchase insured bonds than the traditional municipal bond investors due to the higher average rating and size of bonds issued under the babs programs 
however  the company expects the babs program to expand to include many smaller and lower rated issuers in  which will increase the opportunities for financial guaranties 
financial performance financial performance years ended and as of december  dollars in millions  except per share amounts premiums earned net investment income loss and loss adjustment expenses agmh acquisition related expenses goodwill and settlement of pre existing relationship net income attributable to assured guaranty ltd 
diluted eps shareholders equity attributable to assured guaranty ltd the company reported record premium earnings and significant growth in net investment income in due primarily to the agmh acquisition and strong new business production over the past two years as assured guaranty was able to dominate the financial guaranty market due to ratings downgrades of its competitors 
these revenue increases were  in part  offset by higher losses generated primarily from the insured us rmbs portfolio 
also includes acquisition related expenses incurred to close the transaction and integrate processes and systems and a goodwill impairment 
net income also includes changes in unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives and committed capital securities ccs  which cause volatility in reported net income due to changes in interest rates  credit spreads and other market factors 
effective january   the financial accounting standards board fasb changed the authorative guidance for accounting for financial guaranty contracts which affects comparability between periods for premiums  losses  deferred acquisition cost dac and related ceded balances 
in addition  on july  the company closed the agmh acquisition at a bargain purchase price 
this was the first time an acquisition of a financial guaranty company was completed since the january change in accounting 
acquisition accounting in combination with this new financial guaranty accounting model  which linked unearned premiums to expected losses affected the timing of premium and loss recognition 
beginning january   loss expense is recognized only to the extent that expected losses exceed deferred premium revenue 
when deferred premium revenues increased ie  due to the fair value adjustment to the historical carrying value of agmh s book of business upon acquisition  losses no longer exceeded deferred premium revenue 
however  as deferred premium revenue amortizes into income over the terms of each contract  losses previously recognized in income by financial security assurance holdings ltd 
the predecessor of agmh will re emerge as losses and lae in the later years of each contract 
see note of item for the expected future premium earnings and losses and lae recognition pattern 

table of contents key measures to more accurately reflect the key measures management analyzes in evaluating the company s operations and progress towards long term goals  the company discuses both measures promulgated in accordance with gaap and measures not promulgated in accordance with gaap non gaap measures 
although the measures identified as non gaap should not be considered substitutes for gaap measures  management considers them key performance indicators and employs them as well as other factors in determining compensation 
non gaap measures  therefore  provide investors with important information about the key measures management utilizes in measuring its business 
the three primary non gaap measures analyzed by the company s senior management are operating income  adjusted book value abv and present value of new business production pvp 
operating income the table below presents net income attributable to agl and a reconciliation to operating income 
the operating income measure adjusts net income to remove effects of certain fair value adjustments relating to dislocation in the market and any fair value adjustments where the company does not have the intent or the ability to realize such gains or losses 
operating income is also adjusted for realized gains or losses on its investment portfolio  goodwill and settlement of pre existing relationship resulting from the agmh acquisition 
see non gaap measures 
the comparability of operating income between years is affected by the application of financial guaranty industry specific accounting guidance effective january  and the agmh acquisition on july  see note in item for a description of the differences in premium earnings and loss recognition methodologies for financial guaranty contracts written in insurance form 
in  operating income benefitted from the addition of the premium earnings stream of the agmh book of business 
although the agmh book of business has embedded expected losses  such losses will not emerge in income as loss expense until they exceed the deferred premium revenue 
see note in item other noteworthy items driving the increased operating earnings in were a million after tax foreign exchange gain on revaluation of premiums receivable balances and a million after tax settlement of previously consolidated financial guaranty variable interest entities vies  both of which were recorded in other income 
offsetting such positive operating earnings drivers were increased loss and lae expense in the us rmbs insured portfolio  increased operating expenses  million in after tax agmh acquisition expenses and a goodwill impairment charge 
losses estimated in the first lien us rmbs portfolio increased most significantly in as management has estimated the recovery in the mortgage and real estate markets will take longer than originally expected therefore extending the stress period in its reserve model 
in  operating income declined from the prior year due primarily to increased loss expense in the us rmbs insured portfolio  despite a increase in net premiums earned

one of the key measures used in determining the amount of certain long term compensation to management and employees and used by rating agencies and investors to assess the value of the company is growth in abv as defined under the plan 
similar to operating income  abv adjusts shareholders equity to exclude the effects of certain fair value adjustments deemed to represent dislocations in market values for credit derivatives and ccs which management does not have the intent and or ability to trade 
additional adjustments are made for unrealized gains and losses on the investment portfolio recorded in accumulated oci  dac and for the addition of estimated future earnings not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets

the company has tightened structured finance underwriting standards and lowered risk limits  reflecting its current view of that business and the new information about risk and performance that came to light during the current economic crisis 
in the international infrastructure market during  the company provided secondary market insurance for financings of airports and gas and electric distribution systems in australia

financial strength ratings major securities rating agencies generally assign ratings to obligations insured by agc or agm on the basis of the financial strength ratings assigned to the applicable insurer 
investors frequently rely on rating agency ratings because ratings influence the trading value of securities and form the basis for many institutions investment guidelines 
therefore  the company manages its business with the goal of achieving high financial strength ratings  preferably the highest that an agency will assign to any guarantor 
however  the models used by rating agencies differ  presenting conflicting goals that sometimes make it inefficient or impractical to reach the highest rating level 
the models are not fully transparent  contain subjective data such as assumptions about future market demand for the company s products and change frequently 

table of contents the company s subsidiaries have been assigned the following insurance financial strength ratings as of february  these ratings are subject to continuous review rating agency ratings and outlooks s p moody s assured guaranty corp 
agc aaa aa assured guaranty uk ltd 
aguk aaa aa assured guaranty municipal corp 
agm aaa aa assured guaranty europe ltd 
age aaa aa fsa insurance company fsaic aaa aa financial security assurance international ltd 
fsa international aaa aa assured guaranty re ltd 
ag re aa a assured guaranty re overseas ltd 
agro aa a assured guaranty mortgage insurance company agmic aa a the outlook of the rating of each company is negative  except for the outlook of the ratings of ag re  agro and agmic  which is stable 
aaa extremely strong rating is the highest ranking and aa very strong is the third highest ranking of the ratings categories used by s p 
aa excellent is the fourth highest ranking and a good is the fifth highest ranking of ratings categories used by moody s 
historically  an insurance financial strength rating was an opinion with respect to an insurer s ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms 
the opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract 
insurance financial strength ratings do not refer to an insurer s ability to meet non insurance obligations and are not a recommendation to purchase any policy or contract issued by an insurer or to buy  hold  or sell any security insured by an insurer 
more recently  the ratings also reflect qualitative factors  such as the rating agencies opinion of an insurer s business strategy and franchise value  the anticipated future demand for its product  the composition of its portfolio  and its capital adequacy  profitability and financial flexibility 
the major rating agencies have developed and published rating guidelines for rating financial guaranty and mortgage guaranty insurers and reinsurers 
the insurance financial strength ratings assigned by the rating agencies are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors in agl s common shares 
the rating criteria used by the rating agencies in establishing these ratings include consideration of the sufficiency of capital resources to meet projected growth as well as access to such additional capital as may be necessary to continue to meet applicable capital adequacy standards  a company s overall financial strength  and demonstrated management expertise in financial guaranty and traditional reinsurance  credit analysis  systems development  marketing  capital markets and investment operations 
obligations insured by agc and agm generally are rated aaa by s p and aa by moody s by virtue of such insurance 
these ratings reflect only the views of the respective rating agencies and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
the ratings of agro  agmic  ag uk and age are dependent upon support arrangements such as reinsurance and keepwell agreements 
ag re provides support to its subsidiary agro 
agro provides support to its subsidiary agmic 
agc provides support to its subsidiary aguk 
agm provides support to its subsidiary age 
pursuant to the terms of these agreements  each of ag re  agro  agc and agm agrees to assume exposure from their respective subsidiaries and to provide funds to such subsidiaries sufficient for them to meet their obligations 
on december   moody s concluded the ratings review of agc and ag re that it had initiated on november  when it downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of agc and ag uk from aa to aa and of ag re  agro and agmic from aa to a  and placed all such ratings on review for possible downgrade by confirming the aa insurance financial strength rating of agc and ag uk  and the a insurance financial strength rating of ag re  agro and agmic 
at the same time  moody s affirmed the aa insurance financial strength rating of agm 

table of contents moody s stated that it believed the company s capital support transactions  including agl s issuance of common shares in december that resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  million of which was downstreamed to agc  increased agc s capital to a level consistent with moody s expectations for a aa rating  while leaving its affiliates with capital structures that moody s believes is appropriate for their own ratings 
however  moody s ratings outlook for each such rating is negative because moody s believes there is meaningful remaining uncertainty about the company s ultimate credit losses and the demand for the company s financial guaranty insurance and its competitive position once the municipal finance market normalizes 
there can be no assurance that moody s will not take further action on the company s ratings 
on october   fitch downgraded the debt and insurer financial strength ratings of several of the company s subsidiaries 
until february   when fitch  at the request of the company  withdrew the insurer financial strength and debt ratings of all of the company s rated subsidiaries at their then current levels  fitch s insurer financial strength ratings for agc  aguk  ag re  agro and agmic were aa  and for agm  fsaic  fsa international and age aa 
all of such ratings had been assigned a negative outlook 
on july   s p published a research update in which it affirmed its aaa counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on agc and agm 
at the same time  s p revised its outlook on agc and aguk to negative from stable and continued its negative outlook on agm 
s p cited as a rationale for its actions the large single risk concentration exposure that the company and agm retain to belgium and france prior to the posting of collateral by dexia holdings in october  all in connection with the agmh acquisition 
in addition  the outlook also reflected s p s view that the change in the competitive dynamics of the industry with the potential entrance of new competitors  alternative forms of credit enhancement and limited insurance penetration in the us public finance market could hurt the companies business prospects 
there can be no assurance that s p will not take further action on the company s ratings 
if the ratings of any of the company s insurance subsidiaries were reduced below current levels  the company expects it would have an adverse effect on the relevant subsidiary s competitive position and its prospects for new business opportunities 
a downgrade may also reduce the value of the reinsurance the company offers  which may no longer be of sufficient economic value for the company s customers to continue to cede to the company s subsidiaries at economically viable rates

agmh acquisition on july  the company completed the agmh acquisition  acquiring of the common stock of agmh from dexia holdings and the remaining shares from one of agmh s executives  as described below 
the total purchase price paid by the company was million in cash and million agl common shares 
agl issued approximately million common shares to dexia 
dexia holdings agreed that the voting rights with respect to all agl common shares issued pursuant to the agmh acquisition will constitute less than of the voting power of all issued and outstanding agl common shares 
the company acquired the remaining shares of agmh common stock from agmh s former chief executive officer  for  agl common shares 
the company also exchanged the deemed investment of s an mccarthy  who became the company s chief operating officer following the closing of the agmh acquisition  in  share units of agmh under a agmh nonqualified deferred compensation plan dcp for a deemed investment in  share units of agl 
the agl share units will ultimately be distributed to mr 
mccarthy as a corresponding number of agl common shares at the time he receives a distribution from such nonqualified dcp 

table of contents the acquisition excluded agmh s former financial products segment  which was comprised of its gic business  its mtn business and the equity payment undertaking agreement in the leveraged lease business 
the agmh subsidiaries that conducted agmh s financial products business were transferred to dexia holdings prior to completion of the agmh acquisition 
in addition  as further described under liquidity and capital resources liquidity arrangements with respect to agmh s former financial products business  the company has entered into various agreements with dexia pursuant to which it has assumed the credit and liquidity risks associated with agmh s former financial products business 
the cash portion of the purchase price for the agmh acquisition was financed through the sale of  common shares and  equity units in a public offering in june the equity units initially consist of a forward purchase contract and a undivided beneficial ownership interest in  principal amount senior notes due issued by agus senior notes 
for a description of the equity units  see liquidity and capital resources commitments and contingencies long term debt obligations senior notes 
the net proceeds after underwriting expenses and offering costs for these two offerings totaled approximately million 
as described under wl ross investments  wlr funds managed by wl ross purchased  agl common shares in the june public common share offering at the public offering price in the public offering  pursuant to pre emptive rights 
the company has agreed with dexia holdings to operate the business of agm in accordance with the key parameters described below 
these restrictions will limit the company s operating and financial flexibility 
generally  for three years after the closing of the agmh acquisition unless agm is rated below a by moody s and aa by s p  it will only insure public finance and infrastructure obligation 
an exception applies in connection with the recapture of business ceded by agm to a third party reinsurer under certain circumstances 
agm will continue to be domiciled in new york and be treated as a monoline bond insurer for regulatory purposes 
agm will not take any of the following actions unless it receives prior rating agency confirmation that such action would not cause any rating currently assigned to agm to be downgraded immediately following such action a merger  b issuance of debt or other borrowing exceeding million  c issuance of equity or other capital instruments exceeding million  d entry into new reinsurance arrangements involving more than of the portfolio as measured by either unearned premium reserves or net par outstanding  or e any waiver  amendment or modification of any agreement relating to capital or liquidity support of agm exceeding million 
agm will not repurchase  redeem or pay any dividends in relation to any class of equity interests  unless a at such time agm is rated at least aa by s p and aa by moody s if such rating agencies still rate financial guaranty insurers generally and the aggregate amount of such dividends in any year does not exceed of agmh s debt service for that year  or b agm receives prior rating agency confirmation that such action would not cause any rating currently assigned to agm to be downgraded immediately following such action 

table of contents agm will not enter into a commutation or novation agreements with respect to its insured public finance portfolio involving a payment by agm exceeding million  or b any cut through reinsurance  pledge of collateral security or similar arrangement involving a payment by agm whereby the benefits of reinsurance purchased by agm or of other assets of agm would be available on a preferred or priority basis to a particular class or subset of policyholders of agm relative to the position of dexia as policyholder upon the default or insolvency of agm whether or not with the consent of any relevant insurance regulatory authority 
this provision does not limit x collateral arrangements between agm and its subsidiaries in support of intercompany reinsurance obligations  or y statutory deposits or other collateral arrangements required by law in connection with the conduct of business in any jurisdiction  or z pledges of recoveries or other amounts to secure repayment of amounts borrowed under agm s soft capital facilities or its billion strip liquidity facility with dcl 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity arrangements with respect to the leveraged lease business 
furthermore  until the date on which a a credit rating has been assigned by s p and moody s to the gic issuers and or the liabilities of the gic issuers under the relevant gics have been separately rated by s p and moody s which is independent of the financial strength rating of agm and b the principal amount of gics in relation to which a downgrade of agm may result in a requirement to post collateral or terminate such gic  notwithstanding the existence of a separate rating referred to in a of at least aa or higher is below billion the agm de linkage date agm will restrict its liquidity exposure such that no gic contracts or similar liabilities insured by agm after the closing shall have terms that require acceleration  termination or prepayment based on a downgrade or withdrawal of any rating assigned to agm s financial strength  a downgrade of the issuer or obligor under the agreement  or a downgrade of any third party  and agm will continue to be rated by each of moody s and s p  if such rating agencies still rate financial guaranty insurers generally 
notwithstanding the above  all such restrictions will terminate on any date after the agm de linkage date that the aggregate principal amount or notional amount of exposure of dexia holdings and any of its affiliates excluding the exposures relating to the financial products business to any transactions insured by agm or any of its affiliates prior to november  is less than billion 
breach of any of these restrictions not remedied within days of notice by dexia holdings entitles dexia holdings to payment of damages  injunctive relief or other remedies available under applicable law 
accounting for agmh acquisition under acquisition accounting the acquired companies consolidated balance sheet must be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
the fair value of agmh s direct contracts was recorded on the line items premium receivable  net of ceding commissions payable and unearned premium reserves and the fair value of its ceded contracts was recorded in ceded premiums payable  included in other

the fair value adjustment to unearned premium reserve takes into account ratings  estimated economic losses and current pricing represents the carrying value of agmh s financial guaranty contracts  before intercompany eliminations between ag re and agmh and agc and agmh  the net of which represents the full estimated fair value of the agmh financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance contracts 
on july   consolidated premiums receivable and reinsurance balances payable were recorded at historical value ie the carrying amount on the agmh balance sheet at june   the date prior to the acquisition in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
gross and ceded deferred premium revenue represents the stand ready obligation 
the carrying value recorded on july  takes into account the total fair value of each financial guaranty contract  including expected losses  on a contract by contract basis  less premiums receivable or premiums payable 
incurred losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations line item loss and loss adjustment expenses at the time that they exceed deferred premium revenue on a contract by contract basis 
when a claim payment is made  when there is no loss reserve recorded  it is recorded as a contra deferred premium revenue liability and becomes recognized in the consolidated statements of operations only when the sum of such claim payments and the present value of future expected losses exceeds deferred premium revenue 
see financial guaranty expected losses

agm s contribution to net earned premiums in was million on a consolidated basis  representing six months of activity 
the decrease in the financial guaranty reinsurance premiums is due mainly to reallocation of ag re s assumed book of business from agmh from the financial guaranty reinsurance segment to the financial guaranty direct segment  runoff of the existing book of business and lack of new business in the decrease in net earned premiums in the company s mortgage guaranty segment reflects the continued run off of this business

the year ended december  had million of earned premiums from public finance refunding in the financial guaranty direct segment compared to million in public finance refunding premiums reflect the unscheduled pre payment or refunding of underlying municipal bonds 
the increase in financial guaranty reinsurance segment was due to the increase in public finance refunding of million to million in this increase is primarily a result of greater refunding of municipal auction rate and variable rate debt as reported by the company s ceding companies

the investment yield is a function of market interest rates at the time of investment as well as the type  credit quality and maturity of the invested assets 
pre tax yields to maturity were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although pre tax yields decreased  net investment income increased significantly due to the addition of agmh s billion in invested assets as of july  in accordance with acquisition accounting requirements  the amortized cost basis of investments acquired in the agmh acquisition at the closing date was equal to the fair value at such date 
the net premium to par of million will be amortized to net investment income over the remaining term to maturity of each of the investments

the company continues to monitor the value of these investments 
future events may result in further impairment of the company s investments 
the company recognized million of otti losses substantially related to mortgage backed and corporate securities for the year ended december  primarily due to the fact that it did not have the intent to hold these securities until there was recovery in their value 
year ended december  in millions net realized investment losses  net of related income taxes the company adopted new gaap guidance on april   which prescribed bifurcation of credit and non credit related otti in realized loss and oci  respectively 
prior to april   the entire unrealized loss on otti securities was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
subsequent to that date  only the credit component of the unrealized loss on otti securities was recognized in consolidated statements of operations

the net change in fair value of credit derivatives includes premiums and ceding commissions received or receivable credit impairment including paid plus change in present value of future expected losses which may be recorded in either realized or unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives 
the increase in realized gains on credit derivatives in compared to was due primarily to the addition of earnings on the acquired agmh portfolio of credit derivatives 
the increase in compared to was attributable to growth in the company s direct segment business written in credit derivative form 
agmh s portfolio of credit derivatives will produce a declining amount of revenue as agm does not intend to insure any new structured finance obligations 
losses incurred on credit derivatives in was primarily due to losses in trust preferred securities trups and us rmbs 
table of contents sectors 
the increase for as compared with was primarily due to an increase in portfolio reserves as a result of downgrades within the company s us rmbs credit derivative book of business 
unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives represent the adjustments for changes in fair value that are recorded in each reporting period in the consolidated statements of operations in net unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives 
cumulative unrealized gains losses  determined on a contract by contract basis  are reflected as either assets or liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of credit derivatives occur because of changes in interest rates  credit spreads  the credit ratings of the referenced entities  the company s credit rating and other market factors 
the unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives will reduce to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure or early termination 
in the event that the company terminates a credit derivative contract prior to maturity  the resulting gain or loss will be realized through net change of fair value of credit derivatives 
changes in the fair value of the company s credit derivatives that do not reflect actual or expected claims or credit losses have no impact on the company s claims paying resources  rating agency capital or regulatory capital positions 
the unrealized loss on credit derivatives was primarily due to the decreased cost to buy protection in agc s and agm s name as the market cost of agc s and agm s credit protection declined 
this led to higher implied premiums on several subprime rmbs and trups transactions 
the change in fair value for was attributable to the widening of credit default spreads traded on agc 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s unrealized gain on credit derivatives was attributable to the fair value of high yield and ig corporate collateralized loan obligation transactions  with the balance of the change in fair values principally in the rmbs and cmbs markets 
with considerable volatility continuing in the market  the fair value adjustment amount is expected to fluctuate significantly in future periods

the company views its credit derivatives as an extension of the company s financial guaranty business  however they do not qualify for the financial guaranty insurance scope exception and therefore are reported at fair value  with changes in fair value included in earnings 
the gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
the company enters into credit derivative contracts which require the company to make payments upon 
table of contents the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
the company s credit derivative exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default 
they are contracts that are generally held to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives will reduce to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure 
the company does not typically exit its credit derivative contracts and there are typically no quoted prices for its instruments or similar instruments 
observable inputs other than quoted market prices exist  however  these inputs reflect contracts that do not contain terms and conditions similar to those in the credit derivatives issued by the company 
therefore  the valuation of the company s credit derivative contracts requires the use of models that contain significant  unobservable inputs 
thus  management believes that the company s credit derivative contract valuations are in level in the fair value hierarchy 
see note in item financial statements 
the fair value of these instruments represents the difference between the present value of remaining contractual premiums charged for the credit protection and the estimated present value of premiums that a comparable financial guarantor would hypothetically charge for the same protection at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of these contracts depends on a number of factors including notional amount of the contract  expected term  credit spreads  changes in interest rates  the credit ratings of the referenced entities  the company s own credit risk and remaining contractual flows 
remaining contractual cash flows are the most readily observable variables since they are based on the cds contractual terms 
these variables include net premiums received and receivable on written credit derivative contracts  net premiums paid and payable on purchased contracts  losses paid and payable to credit derivative contract counterparties and losses recovered and recoverable on purchased contracts 
the remaining key variables described above impact unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives 
market conditions at december  were such that market prices for the company s cds contracts were not generally available 
where market prices were not available  the company used proprietary valuation models that used both unobservable and observable market data inputs such as various market indices  credit spreads  the company s own credit spread  and estimated contractual payments to estimate the fair value of its credit derivatives 
these models are primarily developed internally based on market conventions for similar transactions 
management considers the non standard terms of its credit derivative contracts in determining the fair value of these contracts 
these terms differ from more standardized credit derivatives sold by companies outside of the financial guaranty industry 
the non standard terms include the absence of collateral support agreements or immediate settlement provisions 
in addition  the company employs relatively high attachment points and does not exit derivatives it sells for credit protection purposes  except under specific circumstances such as novations upon exiting a line of business 
because of these terms and conditions  the fair value of the company s credit derivatives may not reflect the same prices observed in an actively traded market of cds that do not contain terms and conditions similar to those observed in the financial guaranty market 
these company s models and the related assumptions are continuously reevaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely and relevant market information 
valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information 
management is also required to make assumptions on how the fair value of credit derivative 
table of contents instruments is affected by current market conditions 
management considers factors such as current prices charged for similar agreements  performance of underlying assets  life of the instrument  and the extent of cds exposure the company ceded under reinsurance agreements  and the nature and extent of activity in the financial guaranty credit derivative marketplace 
the assumptions that management uses to determine its fair value may change in the future due to market conditions 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these credit derivative products  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements and the differences may be material 
the gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
the company enters into credit derivative contracts which require it to make payments upon the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
the company s credit derivative exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default

the fair value of ccs represents the difference between the present value of remaining expected put option premium payments under the agc s ccs the agc ccs securities and agm committed preferred trust securities the agm cps securities agreements and the value of such estimated payments based upon the quoted price for such premium payments as of the reporting dates see note in item

increases or decreases in the fair value of the assets are recorded in other income and are primarily offset by like changes in the fair value of the related liability  which are recorded in other operating expenses 
the increase in other operating expenses for compared to was mainly due to the addition of other operating expenses of agmh 
the ccs premium expense reflects the put option premiums associated with agc s ccs and the agm cps securities

expected volatility is estimated at the date of grant based on the historical share price volatility  calculated on a daily basis 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term to the granted stock options 
the expected life is based on the average expected term of the company s guidelines  which are defined as similar or peer entities  since the company has insufficient expected life data 
the forfeiture rate is based on the rate used by the company s guideline companies  since the company has insufficient forfeiture data 
estimated forfeitures will be reassessed at each balance sheet date and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
for options granted before january   the company amortizes the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted on or after january   the company amortizes the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods  with the exception of retirement eligible employees 
stock options are generally granted once a year with exercise prices equal to the closing price on the date of grant 
the company may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect the company s net income or eps 
accounting for cash based compensation in february  the company established the assured guaranty ltd

net ceding commissions paid or received to primary insurers are a large source of dac  constituting and of total dac as of december  and december   respectively 
regarding direct insurance  management uses its judgment in determining which origination related costs should be deferred  as well as the percentage of these costs to be deferred 
the company annually conducts a study to determine which costs and how much acquisition costs should be deferred 
ceding commissions received on premiums the company cedes to other reinsurers reduce acquisition costs 
anticipated losses  lae and the remaining costs of servicing the insured or reinsured business are considered in determining the recoverability of acquisition costs 
acquisition costs associated with credit derivative products are expensed as incurred 
when an insured issue is retired early the remaining related dac is expensed at that time 
upon the adoption of the new accounting guidance that became effective january  ceding commissions associated with future installment premiums on assumed and ceded business were recorded in dac 
for the years ended december   and  acquisition costs incurred were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in was due primarily to the elimination of commission expense related to business assumed from the acquired companies which is now eliminated as an intercompany expense 
the increase of million in compared with was primarily related to the increase in refunded earned premium  and the related deferred ceding commission which was amortized 
goodwill and settlement of pre existing relationships in accordance with gaap  the company does not amortize goodwill  but instead is required to perform an impairment test annually or more frequently should circumstances warrant 
the company reassessed the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter subsequent to the agmh acquisition  which provided the company s largest assumed book of business prior to the acquisition 
as a result of the agmh acquisition  which significantly diminished the company s potential near future market for assuming reinsurance  combined with the continued credit crisis  which has adversely affected the fair value of the company s in force policies  management determined that the full carrying value of million of goodwill on its books prior to the agmh acquisition should be written off in the third quarter in addition  the company recognized a million gain on its purchase of agmh and also recorded a charge of million to settle pre existing relationships

as a result of the new accounting model for financial guaranty contracts implemented on january   positive or adverse development does not emerge in net income until expected losses exceed the deferred premium revenue on a contract by contract basis 
as a result of the application of acquisition accounting related to agmh acquisition  financial guaranty policies acquired in that transaction were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet on the acquisition date at fair value  resulting in the recording of higher unearned premium reserves than similar contracts in the pre existing agc and ag re book of business due to the deterioration in the performance of certain insured transaction as well as changed market conditions 
accordingly  the company will recognize loss and lae earlier on a legacy agc or ag re policy compared to an identical policy in the agm portfolio because its recorded unearned premium reserve is lower

since the onset of the credit crisis in the fall of and the ensuing sharp recession  the company has been intensely involved in risk management activities 
its most significant activities have centered on the residential mortgage sector  where the crisis began  but it is also active in other areas experiencing stress 
residential mortgage loans are loans secured by mortgages on one to four family homes 
rmbs may be broadly divided into two categories first lien transactions  which are generally comprised of loans with mortgages that are senior to any other mortgages on the same property  and second lien transactions  which are comprised of loans with mortgages that are often not senior to other mortgages  but rather are second in priority 
both first lien rmbs and second lien rmbs sometimes include a portion of loan collateral with a different priority than the majority of the collateral 
the discussion below addressed modeling assumptions and methods used to estimated expected losses 
detailed performance data by rmbs category is included in exposure to residential mortgage backed securities 
us second lien rmbs helocs and ces the company insures two types of second lien rmbs  those secured by home equity lines of credit helocs and those secured by ces mortgages 
helocs are revolving lines of credit generally secured by a second lien on a one to four family home 
a mortgage for a fixed amount secured by a second lien on a one to four family home is generally referred to as a ces 
the company has material exposure to second lien mortgage loans originated and serviced by a number of parties  but the company s most significant second lien exposure is to helocs originated and serviced by countrywide 

table of contents the performance of the company s heloc and ces exposures deteriorated beginning and throughout and and transactions  particularly those originated in the period from through  continue to perform below the company s original underwriting expectations 
in accordance with the company s standard practices the company evaluated the most current available information as part of its loss reserving process  including trends in delinquencies and charge offs on the underlying loans and its experience in requiring providers of representations and warranties to purchase ineligible loans out of these transactions 
the following table shows the company s key assumptions used in its calculation of estimated expected losses for these types of policies as of december  and december  key assumptions in base case expected loss estimates second lien rmbs heloc key variables december  december  plateau conditional default rate cdr final cdr trended down to expected period until final cdr months months initial conditional prepayment rate cpr final cpr loss severity future repurchase of ineligible loans million million initial draw rate closed end second lien key variables december  december  plateau cdr final cdr rate trended down to expected period until final cdr achieved months months initial cpr final cpr loss severity future repurchase of ineligible loans million represents assumptions for most heavily weighted scenario 
the primary driver of the adverse development related to the heloc and ces sector is the result of significantly higher total pool delinquencies than had been experienced historically 
in order to project future defaults in each pool  a conditional default rate cdr is applied each reporting period to various delinquency categories to calculate the projected losses to the pool 
during  the company modified its calculation methodology for heloc transactions from an approach that used an average of the prior six months cdr to an approach that projects future cdr based on currently delinquent loans 
this change was made due to the continued volatility in mortgage backed transactions 
management believes that this refinement in approach should prove to be more responsive to changes in cdr rates than the prior methodology 
under this methodology  current representative liquidation rates the percent of loans in a given delinquency status that are assumed to ultimately default are used to estimate losses in the first five months from loans that are currently delinquent and then the cdr of the fifth month is held constant for a period of time 
taken together  the first five months of losses plus the period of time for which the cdr is held constant represent the stress period 
once the stress period has elapsed  the cdr is assumed to gradually trend down to its final cdr over twelve months 
in the base case as of december   the total time between the 
table of contents current period s cdr and the long term assumed cdr used to project losses was months 
at the end of this period  the long term steady cdrs modeled were between and for heloc transactions and between and for ces transactions 
the company continued to assume an extended stress period based on transaction performance and the continued weakened overall economic environment 
the assumption for the conditional prepayment rate cpr  which represents voluntary prepayments  follows a similar pattern to that of the cdr 
the current cpr is assumed to continue for the stress period before gradually increasing to the final cpr  which is assumed to be for both heloc and ces transactions 
this level is much higher than current rates but lower than the historical average  which reflects the company s continued uncertainty about performance of the borrowers in these transactions 
for heloc transactions  the draw rate is assumed to decline from the current level to the final draw rate over a period of months 
the final draw rates were assumed to be between and 
in  the company modeled and probability weighted three possible time periods over which an elevated cdr may potentially occur  one of which assumed a three month shorter period of elevated cdr and another of which assumed a three month longer period of elevated cdr than the most heavily weighted scenario described in the table above 
given that draw rates the amount of new advances provided on existing helocs expressed as a percent of current outstanding advances have been reduced to levels below the historical average and that loss severities in these products have been higher than anticipated at inception  the company believes that the level of the elevated cdr and the length of time it will persist is the primary driver behind the likely amount of losses the collateral will suffer before considering the effects of repurchases of ineligible loans 
the company continues to evaluate all of the assumptions affecting its modeling results 
performance of the collateral underlying certain securitizations has substantially differed from the company s original expectations 
employing several loan file diligence firms and law firms as well as internal resources  as of december  the company had performed a detailed review of approximately  files  representing nearly billion in outstanding par of defaulted second lien loans underlying insured transactions  and identified a material number of defaulted loans that breach representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans such as misrepresentation of income or occupation  undisclosed debt  and the loan not underwritten in compliance with guidelines 
the company continues to review new files as new loans default and as new loan files are made available to it 
following negotiation with the sellers and originators of the breaching loans  as of december  the company had reached agreement to have million of the second lien loans repurchased 
the company has included in its loss estimates for second liens as of december  an estimated benefit from repurchases of million  of which million is netted from the company s gaap loss reserves  with the balance pertaining to policies whose calculated expected loss is less than its deferred premium revenue  principally as a result of the effects of purchase accounting on agm s financial guaranty policies 
the amount the company ultimately recovers related to contractual representations and warranties is uncertain and subject to a number of factors including the counterparty s ability to pay  the number and amount of loans determined to have breached representations and warranties and  potentially  negotiated settlements or litigation 
as such  the company s estimate of recoveries is uncertain and actual amounts realized may differ significantly from these estimates 
in arriving at the expected recovery from breaches of representations and warranties the company considered the credit worthiness of the provider of representations and warranties  the number of breaches found on defaulted loans  the success rate resolving these breaches with the provider of the representations and warranties and the potential amount of time until the recovery is realized 
this calculation involved a variety of scenarios which ranged from the company recovering substantially all of the losses it incurred due to violations of representations and warranties to the company realizing very limited recoveries 
these scenarios were probability weighted in order to 
table of contents determine the recovery incorporated into the company s reserve estimate 
this approach was used for both loans that had already defaulted and those assumed to default in the future 
in all cases recoveries were limited to amounts paid or expected to be paid out by the company 
the ultimate performance of the company s heloc and ces transactions will depend on many factors  such as the level and timing of loan defaults  interest proceeds generated by the securitized loans  prepayment speeds and changes in home prices  as well as the levels of credit support built into each transaction 
the ability and willingness of providers of representations and warranties to repurchase ineligible loans from the transactions will also have a material effect on the company s ultimate loss on these transactions 
finally  other factors also may have a material impact upon the ultimate performance of each transaction  including the ability of the seller and servicer to fulfill all of their contractual obligations including any obligation to fund future draws on lines of credit 
the variables affecting transaction performance are interrelated  difficult to predict and subject to considerable volatility 
if actual results differ materially from any of the company s assumptions  the losses incurred could be materially different from the estimate 
the company continues to update its evaluation of these exposures as new information becomes available 
the primary drivers of the company s approach to modeling potential loss outcomes for transactions backed by second lien collateral are to assume a stressed cdr for a selected period of time and a constant severity rate for the duration of the transaction 
sensitivities around the results of these transactions were modeled by varying the length of the stressed cdr  which corresponds to how long the company assumes the second lien sector remains stressed before a recovery begins and it returns to the long term equilibrium that was modeled when the deal was underwritten 
for heloc and ces  extending the expected period until the cdr begins returning to its long term equilibrium by three months would result in an increase to expected loss of approximately million for heloc transactions and million for ces transactions 
conversely shortening the time until the cdr begins to return to its long term equilibrium by three months decreases expected loss by approximately million for heloc transactions and million for ces transactions 
us first lien rmbs subprime  alt a  option arm and prime first lien rmbs are generally categorized in accordance with the characteristics of the first lien mortgage loans on one to four family homes supporting the transactions 
the collateral supporting subprime rmbs transactions is comprised of first lien residential mortgage loans made to subprime borrowers 
a subprime borrower is one considered to be a higher risk credit based on credit scores or other risk characteristics 
another type of rmbs transaction is generally referred to as alt a rmbs 
the collateral supporting such transactions is comprised of first lien residential mortgage loans made to prime quality borrowers that lack certain ancillary characteristics that would make them prime 
when more than of the loans originally included in the pool are mortgage loans with an option to make a minimum payment that has the potential to negatively amortize the loan ie  increase the amount of principal owed  the transaction is referred to as an option arms 
finally  transactions may include loans made to prime borrowers 
the problems affecting the subprime mortgage market have been widely reported  with rising delinquencies  defaults and foreclosures negatively impacting the performance of subprime rmbs transactions 
those concerns relate primarily to subprime rmbs issued in the period from through as of december   the company had insured billion in net par of subprime rmbs transactions  of which billion was in the financial guaranty direct segment 
these transactions benefit from various structural protections  including credit enhancement that in the direct portfolio for the vintages through currently averages approximately of the remaining insured balance 
of the total net par of subprime rmbs  billion was rated big by the company as of december   with billion in net par rated big or big 
table of contents as has been reported  the problems affecting the subprime mortgage market are affecting option arm rmbs transactions  with rising delinquencies  defaults and foreclosures negatively impacting their performance 
those concerns relate primarily to option arm rmbs issued in the period from through these transactions benefit from various structural protections  including credit enhancement that in the direct portfolio for the vintages through currently averages approximately of the remaining insured balance 
of the company s billion total option arm rmbs net insured par  billion was rated big by the company as of december   with billion in net par rated big or big the factors affecting the subprime mortgage market are now affecting alt a rmbs transactions  with rising delinquencies  defaults and foreclosures negatively impacting their performance 
those concerns relate primarily to alt a rmbs issued in the period from through as of december   the company had insured billion in net par of alt a rmbs transactions  of which billion was in the financial guaranty direct segment 
these transactions benefit from various structural protections  including credit enhancement that in the direct portfolio for the vintages through currently averages approximately of the remaining insured balance 
of the total net par alt a rmbs  billion was rated big by the company as of december   with billion in net par rated big or big as of december  the company had gross reserves in this sector of million  and net reserves of million 
the performance of the company s first lien rmbs exposures  particularly those originated in the period from through  deteriorated during  and and continue to perform below the company s original underwriting expectations 
the majority of the projected losses in the first lien rmbs transactions are expected to come from mortgage loans that are currently delinquent  therefore an increase in delinquent loans beyond those expected last quarter is one of the primary drivers of loss development in this portfolio 
similar to many market participants  the company applies a liquidation rate assumption to loans in various delinquency categories to determine the proportion of loans in those categories expected to eventually default

december  december  days delinquent subprime option arm alt a days delinquent subprime option arm alt a bk subprime option arm alt a foreclosure subprime option arm alt a reo subprime option arm alt a another important driver of loss projections in this area is loss severities  which is the amount of loss the transaction incurs on a loan after the application of net proceeds from the disposal of the underlying property 
loss severities experienced in first lien transactions have reached historical highs  and the company has been revising its assumptions to match experience 
the company is assuming that loss severities begin returning to more normal levels beginning in october  reducing over two or four years to either or points eg from to below their initial levels  depending on the scenario 
the following table shows the company s initial loss severity assumptions as of december  and december  december  december  subprime option arm alt a the primary driver of the adverse development related to first lien exposure  as was the case with the company s second lien transactions  is the result of the continued increase in delinquent mortgages 
during  the company modified its method of predicting losses from one where losses for both current and delinquent loans were projected using liquidation rates to a method where only the loss related to delinquent loans is calculated using liquidation rates  while losses from current loans are determined by applying a cdr trend 
the company made this change so that its methodology would be more responsive in reacting to the volatility in delinquency data 
for delinquent loans  a liquidation rate is applied to loans in various stages of delinquency to determine the portion of loans in each delinquency category that will eventually default 
then  for each transaction  management calculates the constant cdr that  over the next months  would be sufficient to produce the amount of losses that were calculated to emerge from the various delinquency categories 
that cdr plateau is extended 
table of contents another three months  for a total of months  in some scenarios 
each transaction s cdr is calculated to improve over months to an intermediate cdr based upon its cdr plateau  then trail off to its final cdr 
the intermediate cdrs modeled were between and for alt a first lien transactions  between to for option arm transactions and between and for subprime transactions 
the defaults resulting from the cdr after the month period represent the defaults that can be attributed to borrowers that are currently performing 
the assumption for the cpr follows a similar pattern to that of the cdr 
the current level of voluntary prepayments is assumed to continue for the stress period before gradually increasing over months to the final cpr  which is assumed to be either or depending on the scenario run 
in  the company modeled and probability weighted four different scenarios with differing cdr curve shapes  loss severity development assumptions and voluntary prepayment assumptions 
the performance of the collateral underlying certain of these securitizations has substantially differed from the company s original expectations 
as with the second lien policies  as of december  the company had performed a detailed review of nearly  files representing nearly billion in outstanding par of defaulted first lien loans underlying insured transactions  and identified a material number of defaulted loans that breach representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans 
the company continues to review new files as new loans default and as new loan files are made available to it 
following negotiation with the sellers and originators of the breaching loans  as of december   the company had reached agreement to have million of first lien loans repurchased 
the company has included in its loss estimates for first liens an estimated benefit from repurchases of million  of which million is netted from the company s gaap loss reserves  with the balance pertaining to policies whose calculated expected loss is less than its deferred premium revenue  principally as a result of the effects of purchase accounting on agm s financial guaranty policies 
the amount the company ultimately recovers related to contractual representations and warranties is uncertain and subject to a number of factors including the counterparty s ability to pay  the number and amount of loans determined to have breached representations and warranties and  potentially  negotiated settlements or litigation 
as such  the company s estimate of recoveries is uncertain and actual amounts realized may differ significantly from these estimates 
in arriving at the expected recovery from breaches of representations and warranties the company considered  the credit worthiness of the provider of representations and warranties  the number of breaches found on defaulted loans  the success rate resolving these breaches with the provider of the representations and warranty and the potential amount of time until the recovery is realized 
this calculation involved a variety of scenarios which ranged from the company recovering substantially all of the losses it incurred due to violations of representations and warranties to the company realizing very limited recoveries 
these scenarios were probability weighted in order to determine the recovery incorporated into the company s reserve estimate 
this approach was used for both loans that had already defaulted and those assumed to default in the future 
in all cases recoveries were limited to amounts paid or expected to be paid out by the company 
the company also insures one direct prime rmbs transaction rated big with a net outstanding par at december  of million  which it models as an alt a transaction and on which it has established case reserves of million 
finally  the company insures net interest margin nim securities with a net par outstanding as of december  of million 
while these securities are backed by first lien rmbs  the company no longer expects to receive any cash flow on the underlying first lien rmbs and has  therefore  fully reserved for these transactions  with the exception of expected payments of million from third parties to cover principal and interest on the nims 
the ultimate performance of the company s first lien rmbs transactions remains highly uncertain and may be subject to considerable volatility due to the influence of many factors  including the level and timing of loan defaults  changes in housing prices and other variables 
the company will 
table of contents continue to monitor the performance of its rmbs exposures and will adjust the risk ratings of those transactions based on actual performance and management s estimates of future performance 
the company modeled sensitivities for first lien transactions by varying its assumptions of how fast an economic recovery was expected to occur 
the primary variables that were varied when modeling sensitivities were the amount of time until the cdr returned to its modeled equilibrium  which was defined as of the current cdr  and how quickly the stressed loss severity returned to its long term equilibrium  which was approximately a point reduction in the current severity rate 
in a stressed economic environment assuming a slow recovery rate in the performance of the cdr  where the cdr rate steps down in five increments over years  and a year period before severity rates return to their normalized rate  the reserves increase by million for alt a transactions  million for option arm transactions and million for subprime transactions 
conversely  assuming a recovery in the performance of the cdr  whereby the cdr rate steps down in two increments over years  and year period before rates have returned to their normalized rates results in a reserve decrease of approximately million for alt a transactions  million for option arm transactions and million for subprime transactions 
xxx life insurance transactions the company has insured billion of net par in xxx life insurance reserve securitization transactions based on discrete blocks of individual life insurance business 
in these transactions the monies raised by the sale of the bonds insured by the company are used to capitalize a special purpose vehicle that provides reinsurance to a life insurer or reinsurer 
the monies are invested at inception in accounts managed by third party investment managers 
in order for the company to incur an ultimate net loss on these transactions  adverse experience on the underlying block of life insurance policies and or credit losses in the investment portfolio would need to exceed the level of credit enhancement built into the transaction structures 
the company s billion in net par of xxx life insurance transactions includes billion in the financial guaranty direct segment

significant risk management activities the risk oversight and audit committee of the board of directors of agl oversee the company s risk management policies and procedures 
with input from the board committee  specific risk policies and limits are set by the portfolio risk management committee  which includes members of senior management and senior credit and surveillance officers 
as part of its risk management strategy  the company may seek to obtain third party reinsurance or retrocessions and may also periodically enter into other arrangements to alleviate all or a portion of certain risks 
risk management and surveillance personnel are responsible for monitoring and reporting on all transactions in the insured portfolio  including exposures in both the financial guaranty direct and financial guaranty reinsurance segments 
their monitoring and reporting on transactions in the financial guaranty reinsurance segment is dependent on information provided by the ceding company and publically available information about the reinsured transactions 
the primary objective of the surveillance process is to monitor trends and changes in transaction credit quality  detect any deterioration in credit quality  and recommend to management such remedial actions as may be necessary or appropriate 
all transactions in the insured portfolio are assigned internal credit ratings  and surveillance personnel are responsible for recommending adjustments to those ratings to reflect changes in transaction credit quality 
risk management and surveillance personnel are also responsible for managing work out and loss situations when necessary 
the workout committee receives reports from risk management and surveillance on transactions that might benefit from active loss mitigation and develops and approves loss mitigation strategies for those transactions 
the company segregates its insured portfolio of ig and big risks into surveillance categories to facilitate the appropriate allocation of resources to monitoring and loss mitigation efforts and to aid in establishing the appropriate cycle for periodic review for each exposure 
big credits include all credits internally rated lower than bbb 
the company s internal credit ratings are based on the company s internal assessment of the likelihood of default 
the company s internal credit ratings are expressed on a ratings scale similar to that used by the rating agencies and are generally reflective of an approach similar to that employed by the rating agencies 
the company monitors its ig credits to determine whether any new credits need to be internally downgraded to big

the company refreshes its internal credit ratings on individual credits in cycles based on the company s view of the credit s quality  loss potential  volatility and sector 
ratings on credits and in sectors identified as under the most stress or with the most potential volatility are reviewed every quarter 
credits identified through this process as big are subjected to further review by surveillance personnel to determine the various probabilities of a loss 
surveillance personnel present analysis related to potential loss scenarios to the reserve committee 
the reserve committee is composed of the president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief operating officer  general counsel  chief accounting officer and chief surveillance officer of agl and the chief actuary of the company 
the reserve committee establishes reserves for the company  taking into consideration the information provided by surveillance personnel

the company has million of this nol available through and million available through agro s stand alone nol is not permitted to offset the income of any other members of agro s consolidated group 
under applicable accounting rules  the company is required to establish a valuation allowance for nols that the company believes are more likely than not to expire before being utilized 
management has assessed the likelihood of realization of all of its deferred tax assets 
based on this analysis  management believes it is more likely than not that million of agro s million nol will not be utilized before it expires and has established a million valuation allowance related to the nol deferred tax asset 
management believes that all other deferred income taxes are more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance is subject to considerable judgment  is reviewed quarterly and will be adjusted to the extent actual taxable income differs from estimates of future taxable income that may be used to realize nols or capital losses 
for the years ended december   and  income tax expense benefit was million  million and million and the company s effective tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rates reflect the proportion of income recognized by each of the company s operating subsidiaries  with us subsidiaries taxed at the us marginal corporate income tax rate of  uk subsidiaries taxed at the uk marginal corporate tax rate of  and no taxes for the company s bermuda holding company and subsidiaries  and the impact of the goodwill impairment and gain on bargain purchase which is not tax effected

liability for tax basis step up adjustment in connection with the ipo  the company and ace financial services inc afs  a subsidiary of ace  entered into a tax allocation agreement  whereby the company and afs made a section h election that has the effect of increasing the tax basis of certain affected subsidiaries tangible 
table of contents and intangible assets to fair value 
future tax benefits that the company derives from the election will be payable to afs when realized by the company 
as a result of the election  the company has adjusted its net deferred tax liability  to reflect the new tax basis of the company s affected assets 
the additional basis is expected to result in increased future income tax deductions and  accordingly  may reduce income taxes otherwise payable by the company 
any tax benefit realized by the company will be paid to afs 
such tax benefits will generally be calculated by comparing the company s affected subsidiaries actual taxes to the taxes that would have been owed by those subsidiaries had the increase in basis not occurred 
after a year period  to the extent there remains an unrealized tax benefit  the company and afs will negotiate a settlement of the unrealized benefit based on the expected realization at that time 
the company initially recorded a million reduction of its existing deferred tax liability  based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of the section h election 
under the tax allocation agreement  the company estimated that  as of the ipo date  it was obligated to pay million to afs and accordingly established this amount as a liability 
the initial difference  which is attributable to the change in the tax basis of certain liabilities for which there is no associated step up in the tax basis of its assets and no amounts due to afs  resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of million 
as of december  and december   the liability for tax basis step up adjustment  which is included in the company s consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities  was million and million  respectively 
the company has paid ace and correspondingly reduced its liability by million in and financial guaranty variable interest entities the company consolidates vies for which it determines that it is the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether the company is the primary beneficiary  a number of factors are considered  including the design of the entity and the risks the vie was created to pass along to variable interest holders  the extent of credit risk absorbed by the company through its insurance contract and the extent to which credit protection provided by other variable interest holders reduces this exposure and the exposure that the company cedes to third party reinsurers 
the criteria for determining whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie has changed as of january  with the adoption of fas no 
amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r fas 
the company is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of fas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
management believes that it is reasonably likely that the adoption of fas will increase the amount of vie assets and liabilities consolidated in the company s financial statements but that there will be no effect on the company s liquidity

agmh s results are included in the financial guaranty direct segment effective july  financial guaranty insurance provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty that protects the holder of a financial obligation against non payment of principal and interest when due 
upon an issuer s default  the company is required under the financial guaranty contract to pay the principal and interest when due in accordance with the underlying contract 
financial guaranty insurance may be issued to the holders of the insured obligations at the time of issuance of those obligations  or may be issued in the secondary market to holders of public bonds and structured securities 
as an alternative to traditional financial guaranty insurance  credit protection on a particular security or issuer can also be provided through a credit derivative  such as a cds 
a financial guaranty contract written in credit derivative form is a financial instrument whose characteristics and value depend upon the characteristics and value of an underlying obligation 
under a cds  the seller of protection makes a specified payment to the buyer of protection upon the occurrence of one or more specified credit events with respect to a reference obligation or a

credit derivatives typically provide protection to a buyer rather than credit enhancement of an issue as in traditional financial guaranty insurance 
in its financial guaranty reinsurance business  the company assumes all or a portion of risk undertaken by other insurance companies that provide financial guaranty protection 
the financial guaranty reinsurance business consists of public finance and structured finance reinsurance lines 
premiums on public finance are typically written upfront and premiums on structured finance are typically written on an installment basis 
under a reinsurance agreement  the reinsurer receives a premium and  in exchange  agrees to indemnify another insurer  called the ceding company  for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more financial guaranty insurance policies that the ceding company has issued 
mortgage guaranty insurance provides protection to mortgage lending institutions against the default by borrowers on mortgage loans that  at the time of the advance  had a loan to value ratio in excess of a specified ratio 
the company has not been active in writing new business in this segment since the in force book of mortgage business consists of assumed risks undertaken by primary mortgage insurers 
reinsurance in the mortgage guaranty insurance industry is used to increase the insurance capacity of the ceding company  to assist the ceding company in meeting applicable regulatory and rating agency requirements  to augment the financial strength of the ceding company  and to manage the ceding company s risk profile 
the company provides mortgage guaranty protection on an excess of loss basis but has not written any new mortgage insurance in recent years 
the company has participated in several lines of business that are reflected in its historical financial statements but the company exited in connection with its ipo 
the results from these lines of business make up the company s other segment 
financial guaranty direct segment vs the agmh acquisition significantly increased the size of the financial guaranty direct segment 
net par outstanding in the financial guaranty direct segment increased from billion at december  to billion as of december  the financial guaranty direct segment contributed million to the total underwriting gain in the compared to an underwriting loss of million in the increase in underwriting gain in the financial guaranty direct segment in was driven primarily by premium earnings and realized gains on credit derivatives 
premium earnings growth resulted primarily from the agmh acquisition and increased refundings 
on a going forward basis  the agmh portfolio of insured structured finance obligations  including credit derivatives  will generate a declining stream of premium earnings and realized gains on credit derivatives due to agm s focus on underwriting public finance obligations exclusively 
in addition to the premium earnings contribution to the financial guaranty direct segment s underwriting gain  in a million non recurring settlement and distribution of excess cash flow from a financial guaranty vie that was previously consolidated by agmh was recorded in other income  along with million of foreign exchange revaluation gain on premiums receivable 
partially offsetting these increases were increased loss and lae and incurred losses on credit derivatives primarily driven by agc s book of business 
agmh s losses on policies written in financial guaranty form have been substantially absorbed by the unearned premium reserve which was recorded at fair value on july   the date of the agmh acquisition

these benefits were partially offset by increases to case and portfolio reserves of million and million  respectively  for heloc exposures 
portfolio reserves also increased million as a result of management s annual updating of its rating agency default statistics 
the increase in amortization of dac during was directly related to the increase in net earned premiums from non derivative transactions and also reflected a decrease in negotiated ceding commission rates for transactions executed in recent years 
pvp in the reinsurance segment declined in across all sectors due primarily to the lack of new business production at the company s main ceding companies

table of contents exposure to residential mortgage backed securities the company s risk management and surveillance personnel are responsible for monitoring and reporting on all transactions in the insured portfolio 
the primary objective of the surveillance process is to monitor trends and changes in transaction credit quality  to detect any deterioration in credit quality and to take such remedial actions as may be necessary or appropriate to mitigate loss 
all transactions in the insured portfolio are risk rated  and surveillance personnel are responsible for recommending adjustments to these ratings to reflect changes in transaction credit quality 
in assessing the credit quality of its insured portfolio  the company takes into consideration a variety of factors 
for rmbs exposures such factors include the amount of credit support or subordination benefiting the company s exposure  delinquency and loss trends on the underlying collateral  the extent to which the exposure has amortized and the year in which it was insured

non gaap measures management uses non gaap financial measures in its analysis of the company s results of operations and communicates such non gaap measures to assist analysts and investors in evaluating assured guaranty s financial results 
this presentation is consistent with how assured guaranty s management  analysts and investors evaluate assured guaranty financial results and is comparable to estimates published by analysts in their research reports on assured guaranty 
operating income operating income is a non gaap financial measure defined as net income loss attributable to assured guaranty ltd 
which excludes noncontrolling interest in consolidated vies adjusted for the following elimination of the after tax realized gains losses on investments  elimination of the after tax non credit impairment fair value gains losses on credit derivatives accounted for as derivatives  which is the amount in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses  elimination of the after tax fair value gains losses on the company s committed capital  and elimination of goodwill and settlement of pre existing relationships 

table of contents management believes that operating income is a useful measure for management  investors and analysts because the presentation of operating income clarifies the understanding of the company s results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of its business 
realized gains and losses on investments are excluded from operating income because the timing and amount of realized gains and losses are not directly related to the company s insurance businesses 
non credit impairment unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives  and unrealized gains and losses on the company s ccs are excluded from operating income because these gains and losses do not result in an economic gain or loss  and are heavily affected by  and fluctuate  in part  according to changes in market interest rates  credit spreads and other factors unrelated to the company 
this measure should not be viewed as a substitute for net income loss determined in accordance with gaap 
adjusted book value abv is calculated as shareholders equity attributable to agl which excludes noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities adjusted for the following elimination of the after tax non credit impairment fair value gains losses on credit derivatives accounted for as derivatives  which is the amount in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses  elimination of the after tax fair value gains losses on the company s ccs  elimination of the after tax unrealized gains losses on investment portfolios  recorded as a component of accumulated comprehensive income  excluding foreign exchange revaluation  elimination of after tax dac  addition of the after tax net present value of expected estimated future revenue on credit derivatives in force  less ceding commissions and premium taxes in excess of expected losses  discounted at the tax equivalent yield on the investment portfolio for periods beginning in and for periods prior to  and the addition of the after tax value of net unearned revenue on credit derivatives  and addition of the after tax value of the net unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts in excess of net expected loss 
management believes that abv is a useful measure for management  equity analysts and investors because the calculation of abv permits an evaluation of the net present value of the company s in force premiums and shareholders equity 
the premiums included in abv will be earned in future periods  but may differ materially from the estimated amounts used in determining current abv due to changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  refinancing or refunding activity  prepayment speeds  policy changes or terminations  credit defaults and other factors

determined in accordance with gaap 
pvp or present value of new business production pvp is a non gaap financial measure defined as gross upfront and installment premiums received and the present value of gross estimated future installment premiums  on insurance and credit derivative contracts written in the current period  discounted at for december  and management believes that pvp is a useful measure for management  investors and analysts because it permits the evaluation of the value of new business production for assured guaranty by taking into account the value of estimated future installment premiums on all new contracts underwritten in a reporting period  whether in insurance or credit derivative contract form  which gaap gwp and net credit derivative premiums received and receivable portion of net realized gains and other settlement on credit derivatives credit derivative revenues do not adequately measure 
for purposes of the pvp calculation  management discounts estimated future installment premiums on insurance contracts

additionally  under gaap management records future installment premiums on financial guaranty insurance contracts covering non homogeneous pools of assets based on the contractual term of the transaction  whereas for pvp purposes  management records an estimate of the future installment premiums the company expects to receive  which may be a shorter period of time than the contractual term of the transaction 
actual future net earned or written premiums and credit derivative revenues may differ from pvp due to factors including  but not limited to  prepayments  amortizations  refundings  contract terminations or defaults that may or may not result from changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  refinancing or refundings  prepayment speeds  policy changes or terminations  credit defaults or other factors 
pvp should not be viewed as a substitute for gwp determined in accordance with gaap 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity requirements and sources agl agl s liquidity  is largely dependent upon the ability of its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to agl  and its access to external financings  agl s liquidity requirements include the payment of operating expenses  interest on debt  and dividends on common shares 
agl may also require liquidity to make periodic capital investments in its operating subsidiaries 
in the ordinary course of business  the company evaluates its liquidity needs and capital resources in light of holding company expenses  and dividend policy  as well as rating agency considerations 
management believes that agl will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs over the next twelve months  including the ability to pay dividends on agl common shares 
total cash paid in  and for dividends to shareholders was million  or per common share  million  or per common share  and million  or per common share  respectively 
the company anticipates that  for the next twelve months amounts paid by agl s operating subsidiaries as dividends will be a major source of its liquidity 
it is possible that agl or its subsidiaries in the future may need to seek additional external debt or equity financing in order to pay operating expenses  debt service  dividends on its common shares or to maintain its credit rating for one or more of the rating agencies 
external sources of financing may or may not be available to the company  and if available  the cost of such financing may be higher than the company s current level 
operating subsidiaries liquidity at the company s operating subsidiaries is used to pay operating expenses  claims  including payment obligations in respect of credit derivatives  including collateral postings  reinsurance premiums and dividends to agus and agmh for debt service and dividends to agl  as well as  where appropriate  to make capital investments in their own subsidiaries 
in addition  certain of the operating companies may be required to post additional collateral in connection with credit derivatives and reinsurance transactions 
management believes that its subsidiaries liquidity needs generally can be met from current cash short term investments and operating cash flow  including gwp as well as investment income and scheduled maturities and paydowns from their respective investment portfolios 
beyond the next months  the ability of the operating subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends may be influenced by a variety of factors including market conditions  insurance regulations and rating agency capital requirements and general economic conditions 
insurance policies the company issued provide  in general  that payments of principal  interest and other amounts insured may not be accelerated by the holder of the obligation 
amounts paid by the company therefore are typically in accordance with the obligation s original payment schedule or  at the company s option  may be on an accelerated basis 
insurance policies guaranteeing payments under cds may provide for acceleration of amounts due upon the occurrence of certain credit events  subject 
table of contents to single risk limits specified in the insurance laws of the state of new york the new york insurance law 
these constraints prohibit or limit acceleration of certain claims according to article of the new york insurance law and serve to reduce the company s liquidity requirements 
payments made in settlement of the company s obligations arising from its insured portfolio may  and often do  vary significantly from year to year depending primarily on the frequency and severity of payment defaults and whether the company chooses to accelerate its payment obligations in order to mitigate future losses 
the terms of the company s cds contracts generally are modified from standard cds contract forms approved by the international swaps and derivatives association  inc isda in order to provide for payments on a scheduled basis and replicate the terms of a traditional financial guaranty insurance policy 
some contracts the company enters into as the credit protection seller  however  utilize standard isda settlement mechanics of cash settlement ie  a process to value the loss of market value of a reference obligation or physical settlement ie  delivery of the reference obligation against payment of principal by the protection seller in the event of a credit event  as defined in the terms of the contract 
cash settlement or physical settlement generally requires the payment of a larger amount  prior to the maturity of the reference obligation than would settlement on a pay as you go basis  under which the company would be required to pay scheduled interest shortfalls during the term of reference obligation and scheduled principal shortfall only at the final maturity of the reference obligation 
the company s cds contracts also generally provide that if events of default or termination events specified in the cds documentation were to occur  the non defaulting or the non affected party  which may be either the company or the counterparty  depending upon the circumstances  may decide to terminate the cds contract prior to maturity 
the company may be required to make a termination payment to its swap counterparty upon such termination

at december   there was billion in net par outstanding for pooled corporate cds 
at that date  approximately of the obligations insured by the company in cds form referenced funded cdos and referenced synthetic cdos 
potential acceleration of claims with respect to cds obligations occur with funded cdos and synthetic cdos  as described below funded cdos the company has credit exposure to the senior tranches of funded corporate cdos 
the senior tranches are typically rated triple a at the time of inception 
while the majority of these exposures obligate the company to pay only shortfalls in scheduled interest and principal at final maturity  in a limited number of cases the company has agreed to physical settlement following a credit event 
in these limited circumstances  the company has adhered to internal limits within applicable statutory single risk constraints 
in these transactions  the credit events giving rise to a payment obligation are a the bankruptcy of the special purpose issuer or b the failure by the issuer to make a scheduled payment of interest or principal pursuant to the referenced senior debt security 
synthetic cdos in the case of pooled corporate synthetic cdos  where the company s credit exposure was typically set at super triple a levels at the time of inception  the company is exposed to credit losses of a synthetic pool of corporate obligors following the exhaustion of a deductible 
in these transactions  losses are typically calculated using isda cash settlement mechanics 
as a result  the company s exposures to the individual corporate obligors within any synthetic transaction are constrained by the new york insurance law single risk limits 
in these transactions  the credit events giving rise to a payment obligation are generally a the reference entity s bankruptcy  b failure by the reference entity to pay its debt obligations  and c in certain transactions  the restructuring of the reference entity s debt obligations 
the company generally would not be required to make a payment until aggregate credit losses exceed the designated deductible threshold and only as each incremental default occurs 
once the deductible is exhausted  each further credit event would give rise to cash settlements 

table of contents insurance company restrictions the insurance company subsidiaries ability to pay dividends depends  among other things  upon their financial condition  results of operations  cash requirements  and compliance with rating agency requirements  and is also subject to restrictions contained in the insurance laws and related regulations of their states of domicile

on june   affiliates of dexia executed amended and restated liquidity commitments to fsa asset management llc fsam  a former agmh subsidiary  of billion in the aggregate 
pursuant to the liquidity commitments  the dexia affiliates assume the risk of loss  and support the payment obligations of fsam and the three former agmh subsidiaries that issued gics collectively  the gic issuers in respect of the gics and the gic business 
the term of the commitments will generally extend until the gics have been paid in full

the dexia put contracts reference separate portfolios of fsam assets to which assets owned by fsam as of september  were allocated  with the less liquid assets and the assets with the lowest market to market values generally being allocated to the guaranteed put contract 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding principal balance of fsam assets related to the guaranteed put contract was equal to approximately billion and the aggregate principal balance of fsam assets related to the non guaranteed put contract was equal to approximately billion 
pursuant to the dexia put contracts  fsam may put an amount of fsam assets to dexia sa and dcl in exchange for funds in an amount generally equal to the lesser of a the outstanding principal balance of the gics and b the shortfall related to i the failure of a dexia party to provide liquidity or collateral as required under the guaranteed liquidity facilities a liquidity default trigger or ii the failure by either dexia sa or dcl to transfer the required amount of eligible collateral under the credit support annex of the applicable dexia put contract a collateral default trigger  in exchange for funds in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of an fsam asset with respect to which any of the following events have occurred an asset default trigger a the issuer of such fsam asset fails to pay the full amount of the expected interest when due or to pay the full amount of the expected principal when due following expiration of any grace period or within five business days following the scheduled due date  b a writedown or applied loss results in a reduction of the outstanding principal amount  or c the attribution of a principal deficiency or realized loss results in a reduction or subordination of the current interest payable on such fsam asset  provided  that dexia sa and dcl have the right to elect to pay only the difference between the amount of the expected principal or interest payment and the amount of the actual principal or interest payment  in each case  as such amounts come due  rather than paying an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of applicable fsam asset  and or in exchange for funds in an amount equal to the lesser of a the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all fsam assets in the relevant portfolio and b the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all of the gics  upon the occurrence of an insolvency event with respect to dexia sa as set forth in the dexia put contracts a bankruptcy trigger

prior to september  the expected first collateral posting date  the aggregate mark to market value of the fsam assets related to the guaranteed put contract will be deemed to be equal to the aggregate unpaid principal balance of such assets for purposes of calculating their mark to market value 
as a result  it is expected that dexia sa and dcl will not be required to post collateral until the expected first collateral posting date 
additional collateralization is required in respect of certain other liabilities of fsam 

table of contents on june   the states of belgium and france the states issued a guarantee to fsam pursuant to which the states guarantee  severally but not jointly  dexia s payment obligations under the guaranteed put contract  subject to certain limitations set forth therein 
the states guarantee with respect to payment demands arising from liquidity default triggers and collateral default triggers is scheduled to expire on october   and the states guarantee with respect to payment demands arising from an asset default trigger or a bankruptcy trigger is scheduled to expire on the earlier of a the final maturity of the latest maturing of the remaining fsam assets related to the guaranteed put contract  and b march  despite the execution of such documentation  the company remains subject to the risk that dexia or even the belgian state and or the french state may not make payments or securities available a on a timely basis  which is referred to as liquidity risk  or b at all  which is referred to as credit risk  because of the risk of default 
even if dexia and or the belgian state or the french state have sufficient assets to pay all amounts when due  concerns regarding dexia s or such states financial condition or willingness to comply with their obligations could cause one or more rating agencies to view negatively the ability or willingness of dexia or such states to perform under their various agreements and could negatively affect the company s ratings 
one situation in which agm may be required to pay claims in respect of agmh s former financial products business if dexia or if the belgian or french states do not comply with their obligations is if agm is downgraded 
most of the gics insured by agm allow for the withdrawal of gic funds in the event of a downgrade of agm  unless the relevant gic issuer posts collateral or otherwise enhances its credit 
most gics insured by agm allow for the termination of the gic contract and a withdrawal of gic funds in the event of a downgrade of agm below a specified threshold  generally below a by s p or a by moody s  with no right of the gic issuer to avoid such withdrawal by posting collateral or otherwise enhancing its credit 
each gic contract stipulates the thresholds below which the gic provider must post eligible collateral along with the types of securities eligible for posting and the collateralization percentage applicable to each security type 
these collateralization percentages range from of the gic balance for cash posted as collateral to  typically  for asset backed securities 
at december   a downgrade of agm to below aa by s p and aa by moody s ie  a by s p and a by moody s would result in withdrawal of million of gic funds and the need to post collateral on gics with a balance of  million 
in the event of such a downgrade  assuming an average margin of  the market value as of december  that the gic issuers would be required to post in order to avoid withdrawal of any gic funds would be  million 
as of december   the accreted value of the liabilities of the financial products companies exceeded the market value of their assets by approximately billion before any tax effects and including the aggregate net market value of the derivative portfolio of million 
if dexia or if the belgian or french states do not fulfill their contractual obligations  the financial products companies may not have the financial ability to pay upon the withdrawal of gic funds or post collateral or make other payments in respect of the gics  thereby resulting in claims upon the agm financial guaranty insurance policies 
if agm is required to pay a claim due to a failure of the financial products companies to pay amounts in respect of the gics  agm is subject to the risk that the gics will not be paid from funds received from dexia or the belgian state and or the french state before it is required to make payment under its financial guaranty policies or that it will not receive the guaranty payment at all 
the mtn business in connection with the company s agmh acquisition  dcl issued a funding guaranty the funding guaranty pursuant to which dcl has guaranteed  for the benefit of agm and financial security assurance international  ltd

agm  the company and related parties are also protected against losses arising out of or as a result of the mtn business through an indemnification agreement with dcl 
the leveraged lease business on july   dcl  acting through its new york branch dexia cr dit local ny  and agm entered into a strip coverage liquidity and security agreement the strip coverage facility pursuant to which dexia cr dit local ny agreed to make loans to agm  for the purpose of financing the payment of claims under certain financial guaranty insurance policies strip policies that were outstanding as of november  and issued by agm  or an affiliate or a subsidiary of agm 
the strip policies guaranteed the payment of unfunded strip coverage amounts to a lessor in a leveraged lease transaction  in the event that a tax exempt entity defaulted on its obligation to pay this portion of its early termination payment 
agm may request advances under the strip coverage facility without any explicit limit on the number of loan requests  provided that the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding as of any date may not exceed billion the commitment amount 
the commitment amount a may be reduced at the option of agm without a premium or penalty  and b will be reduced in the amounts and on the dates described in the strip coverage facility either in connection with the scheduled amortization of the commitment amount or if agm s consolidated net worth as of june  is less than a specified consolidated net worth 
as of december   no advances were outstanding under the strip coverage facility 
dexia cr dit local ny s commitment to make advances under the strip coverage facility is subject to the satisfaction by agm of customary conditions precedent  including compliance with certain financial covenants  and will terminate at the earliest of a the occurrence of a change of control with respect to agm  b the reduction of the commitment amount to and c january  sensitivity to ratings agency actions in reinsurance business and insured cds portfolio the company s reinsurance business and its insured cds portfolio are both sensitive to rating agency actions 
the rating actions taken by moody s on november  to downgrade the insurance financial strength rating of ag re and its subsidiaries to a from aa and to downgrade the insurance financial strength rating of agc and aguk to aa from aa have the following effects upon the business and financial condition of those companies 

table of contents with respect to a significant portion of the company s in force financial guaranty reinsurance business  due to the downgrade of ag re to a  subject to the terms of each reinsurance agreement  the ceding company may have the right to recapture business ceded to ag re and assets representing substantially all of the statutory unearned premium and loss reserves if any associated with that business 
as of december   the statutory unearned premium  which represents deferred revenue to the company  subject to recapture was approximately million 
if this entire amount were recaptured  it would result in a corresponding one time reduction to net income of approximately million 
additionally  if the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries were reduced below current levels  the company could be required to make a termination payment on certain of its credit derivative contracts as determined under the relevant documentation 
as of the date of this filing  if agc s ratings were downgraded to levels between bbb or baa and bb or ba  certain cds counterparties could terminate certain cds contracts covering approximately billion par insured  compared to approximately billion as of december  as of the date of this filing  none of ag re  agro or agm had any material cds exposure subject to termination based on its rating 
the company does not believe that it can accurately estimate the termination payments it could be required to make if  as a result of any such downgrade  a cds counterparty terminated its cds contracts with the company 
these payments could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
under a limited number of other cds contracts  the company may be required to post eligible securities as collateral generally cash or us government or agency securities 
for certain of such contracts  this requirement is based on a mark to market valuation  as determined under the relevant documentation  in excess of contractual thresholds that decline or are eliminated if the company s ratings decline 
under other contracts  the company has negotiated caps such that the posting requirement cannot exceed a certain amount 
as of december   without giving effect to thresholds that apply under current ratings  the amount of par that is subject to collateral posting is approximately billion 
counterparties have agreed that for approximately billion of that billion  the maximum amount that the company could be required to post at current ratings is million  if agc were downgraded to a by s p or a by moody s  that maximum amount would be million 
as of december   the company had posted approximately million of collateral in respect of approximately billion of par insured 
the company may be required to post additional collateral from time to time  depending on its ratings and on the market values of the transactions subject to the collateral posting

market risk market risk represents the potential for losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in market conditions 
the primary market risks that impact the value of the company s financial instruments are interest rate risk  and credit spread risk 
each of these risks and the specific types of financial instruments impacted are described below 
senior managers in the company s surveillance department are responsible for monitoring risk limits and applying risk measurement methodologies 
the estimation of potential losses arising from adverse changes in market conditions is a key element in managing market risk 
the company uses various systems  models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage market risk 
these models include estimates made by management that use current and historic market information 
the valuation results from these models could differ materially from amounts that actually are realized in the market 
financial instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates consist primarily of investment securities 
the primary objective in managing the company s investment portfolio is generation of an optimal level of after tax investment income while preserving capital and maintaining adequate liquidity 
investment strategies are based on many factors  including the company s tax position  fluctuation in interest rates  regulatory and rating agency criteria and other market factors 
prior to mid october  the company s investment portfolio was managed by blackrock financial management  inc and western asset management 
in mid october  in addition to blackrock financial management  inc  the company retained deutsche investment management americas inc  general re new england asset management  inc and wellington management company  llp to manage the company s investment portfolio 
the company s investment managers have discretionary authority over the company s investment portfolio within the limits of the company s investment guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
financial instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in credit spreads consist primarily of assured guaranty s outstanding credit derivative contracts 
the company enters into credit derivative contracts which require it to make payments upon the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying obligation generally a fixed income obligation 
the company s credit derivative exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default  and are generally not subject to collateral calls due to changes in market value 
in general  the company structures credit derivative transactions such that the circumstances giving rise to the obligation to make loss payments is similar to that for financial 
table of contents guaranty insurance policies and only occurs as losses are realized on the underlying reference obligation 
nonetheless  credit derivative transactions are governed by isda documentation and operate differently from financial guaranty insurance policies 
for example  the company s control rights with respect to a reference obligation under a credit derivative may be more limited than when the company issues a financial guaranty policy on a direct primary basis 
in addition  while the company s exposure under credit derivatives  like its exposure under financial guaranty policies  is generally for as long as the reference obligation remains outstanding  unlike financial guaranty insurance policies  a credit derivative may be terminated for a breach of the isda documentation or other specific events 
under certain documents  the company may have the right to cure the termination event by posting collateral  assigning its rights and obligations in respect of the transactions to a third party or seeking a third party guarantee of the obligations of the company 
if certain of its credit derivative contracts are terminated  the company could be required to make a termination payment as determined under the relevant documentation  although under certain documents  the company may have the right to cure the termination event by posting collateral  assigning its rights and obligations in respect of the transactions to a third party or seeking a third party guaranty of the obligations of the company 
valuation of credit derivatives unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives are a function of changes in the estimated fair value of the company s credit derivative contracts 
if credit spreads of the underlying obligations change  the fair value of the related credit derivative changes 
market liquidity could also impact valuations of the underlying obligations 
as such  assured guaranty experiences mark to market gains or losses 
the company considers the impact of its own credit risk  together with credit spreads on the risk that it assumes through cds contracts  in determining the fair value of its credit derivatives 
the company determines its own credit risk based on quoted cds prices traded on the company at each balance sheet date 
the quoted price of cds contracts traded on agc at december  and december  was basis points and  basis points  respectively 
the quoted price of cds contracts traded on agm at december  and july  was bps and  bps  respectively 
historically  the price of cds traded on agc and agm moves directionally the same as general market spreads 
generally  a widening of the cds prices traded on agc and agm has an effect of offsetting unrealized losses that result from widening general market credit spreads  while a narrowing of the cds prices traded on agc and agm has an effect of offsetting unrealized gains that result from narrowing general market credit spreads 
an overall narrowing of spreads generally results in an unrealized gain on credit derivatives for the company and an overall widening of spreads generally results in an unrealized loss for the company 
the impact of changes in credit spreads will vary based upon the volume  tenor  interest rates  and other market conditions at the time these fair values are determined 
in addition  since each transaction has unique collateral and structure terms  the underlying change in fair value of each transaction may vary considerably 
the fair value of credit derivative contracts also reflects the change in the company s own credit cost  based on the price to purchase credit protection on agc and agm 
during  the company incurred net pre tax unrealized losses on credit derivatives of million 
as of december  the net credit liability included a reduction in the liability of billion representing agc s and agm s credit value adjustment  which was based on the market cost of agc s and agm s credit protection of and basis points  respectively 
management believes that the trading level of agc s and agm s credit spread was due to the correlation between agc s and agm s risk profile and that experienced currently by the broader financial markets and increased demand for credit protection against agc and agm as the result of its financial guaranty direct segment financial guarantee volume  as well as the overall lack of liquidity in the cds market 
offsetting the benefit attributable to agc s and agm s credit spread were declines in fixed income security market prices primarily attributable to widening spreads in certain markets as a result of the 
table of contents continued deterioration in credit markets and some credit rating downgrades 
the higher credit spreads in the fixed income security market were primarily due to continuing market concerns over the most recent vintages of subprime rmbs and trust preferred securities 
the total notional amount of credit derivative exposure outstanding as of december  and december  and included in the company s financial guaranty exposure was billion and billion  respectively 
the increase was due to the agmh acquisition 
the company generally holds these credit derivative contracts to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments will reduce to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure or early termination 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair values on the net balance of the company s credit derivative positions assuming immediate parallel shifts in credit spreads on agc and agm and on the risks that they both assume as of december  credit spreads estimated net fair value pre tax estimated pre tax change in gain loss in millions widening in spreads widening in spreads widening in spreads widening in spreads base scenario narrowing in spreads narrowing in spreads narrowing in spreads includes the effects of spreads on both the underlying asset classes and the company s own credit spread 
valuation of investments as of december  and december   the company had total investments of billion and billion  respectively 
the fair values of all of its investments are calculated from independent market valuations 
the fair values of the company s us treasury securities are primarily determined based upon broker dealer quotes obtained from several independent active market makers 
the fair values of the company s portfolio other than us treasury securities are determined primarily using matrix pricing models 
the matrix pricing models incorporate factors such as tranche type  collateral coupons  average life  payment speeds  and spreads  in order to calculate the fair values of specific securities owned by the company 
as of december   of the company s fixed maturity securities were classified as level  were classified as level and its short term investments were classified as either level or level as of december   all of its fixed maturity securities were classified as level and its short term investments were classified as either level or level as of december   approximately of the company s investments were long term fixed maturity securities  and its portfolio had an average duration of years  compared with and years as of december  changes in interest rates affect the value of its fixed maturity portfolio 
as interest rates fall  the fair value of fixed maturity securities increases and as interest rates rise  the fair value of fixed maturity securities decreases 
the company s portfolio is comprised primarily of high quality  liquid instruments 
the company continues to receive sufficient information to value its investments and has not had to modify its approach due to the current market conditions
