item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
chapter reorganization and settlement with hansen on july   we and our wholly owned subsidiary luna technologies filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code bankruptcy code 
during the period from the filing date until january   the date we emerged from chapter  we and luna technologies operated as a debtor in possession 
as a result of these chapter filings  actions to collect pre petition indebtedness and the pending hansen litigation were stayed 
in addition  under the bankruptcy code we had the right to assume or reject executory contracts  including real estate leases  employment contracts  personal property leases  service contracts and other unexpired executory pre petition contracts  subject to court approval 
we did not reject any such contracts in our chapter plan as confirmed by the court 
our plan of reorganization was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on january   and we emerged from chapter on that date 
in december we entered into a settlement agreement with hansen  which reduced our liability with respect to our outstanding litigation to million 
as part of the settlement  in january we issued to hansen a million secured promissory note and approximately million shares of our common stock 
we also entered into a supply and development agreement with hansen as well as certain license agreements  and we entered into an amendment to our supply and development agreement with intuitive surgical which  among other things  amended the license agreement with intuitive to conform the license to the agreement with hansen 
the hansen litigation  including settlement efforts  resulted in significant legal expenses and related costs that are included in operating expenses for the year ended december  the chapter reorganization also resulted in significant legal expenses and related costs that are included in reorganization expenses for the year ended december  overview we research  develop and commercialize innovative technologies in two primary areas of focus test measurement  sensing  and instrumentation products and health care products 
we have a disciplined and integrated business model that is designed to accelerate the process of bringing new and innovative products to market 
we identify technologies that can fulfill large and unmet market needs and then take these technologies from the applied research stage through commercialization 
although revenues from product sales currently represent less than half of our total revenues  we continue to invest in product development and commercialization  which we anticipate will lead to increased product sales growth 
in the future  we expect that revenues from product sales will represent a larger proportion of our total revenues 
in addition  we anticipate that these revenues will reflect a broader and more diversified mix of products as we develop and commercialize new products 
our business model employs a market driven approach and provides the infrastructure  resources and know how throughout the process of developing and commercializing new products 
to manage a diverse set of 
table of contents products effectively across a range of development stages  we are organized into two main groups our technology development division and our products division 
these groups work together through all product development stages  including searching for emerging technologies based on market needs  conducting applied research  developing and commercializing innovative products  and applying proven technologies and products to new market opportunities 
our annual revenues were million in  and million in and million in we generate revenues through technology development services provided under contractual arrangements  product sales  product development under contractual relationships  and license fees 
historically  our technology development revenues have accounted for a large proportion of our total revenues  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our technology development revenues grew from million in to million in and decreased to million in we have historically had a backlog of contracts for which work has been scheduled  but for which a specified portion of work has not yet been completed 
we define backlog as the dollar amount of obligations payable to us under negotiated contracts upon completion of a specified portion of work that has not yet been completed  exclusive of revenues previously recognized for work already performed under these contracts  if any 
total backlog includes funded backlog the amount for which money has been directly authorized by the us congress and for which a purchase order has been received by a commercial customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated 
indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog 
the approximate value of our backlog was million at december  revenues from product sales currently represent a smaller proportion of our total revenues  and  historically  we have derived most of these revenues from the sales of our sensing systems and products that make use of light transmitting optical fibers  or fiber optics 
although we have been successful in licensing certain technology in past years  we do not expect license revenues to represent a significant portion of future revenues  however  over time we do intend to gradually increase such revenues 
in the near term  we expect revenues from product sales and product development to be primarily in areas associated with our fiber optic instrumentation and test and measurement platforms 
in the long term  we expect that revenues from product sales will represent a larger proportion of our total revenues and that as we develop and commercialize new products  these revenues will reflect a broader and more diversified mix of products 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant increase in the net loss in is attributable to the costs incurred with respect to our litigation with hansen and subsequent chapter reorganization  as described below 
we emerged from chapter in january and  accordingly we do not anticipate incurring such costs beyond the first quarter of we do expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we expand our business  including increased expenses for research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing capability 
we may also grow our business in part through acquisitions of additional companies and complementary technologies  which could cause us to incur transaction expenses  amortization or write offs of intangible assets and other acquisition related expenses 
as a result  we expect that we may likely continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future  and these losses could be substantial 
there was a rapid softening of the economy and tightening of the financial markets in the second half of that continued throughout this slowing of the economy has reduced the financial capacity of our customers and possibly our potential customers  thereby slowing spending on the products and services we provide 
the outlook for the economy for remains uncertain 

table of contents description of our revenues  costs and expenses revenues we generate revenues from technology development  product sales and commercial product development and licensing activities 
we derive technology development revenues from providing research and development services to third parties  including government entities  academic institutions and corporations  and from achieving milestones established by some of these contracts and in collaboration agreements 
in general  we complete contracted research over periods ranging from six months to three years  and recognize these revenues over the life of the contract as costs are incurred or upon the achievement of certain milestones built into the contracts 
our product and license revenues reflect amounts that we receive from sales of our products or development of products for third parties and represented approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  our license revenues are comprised of fees paid to us in connection with licenses or sublicenses of certain patents and other intellectual property 
cost of revenues cost of revenues associated with technology development revenues consists of costs associated with performing the related research activities  including direct labor  amounts paid to subcontractors and overhead allocated to technology development activities 
cost of revenues associated with product sales and license revenues consists of license fees for use of certain technologies  product manufacturing costs including all direct material and direct labor costs  amounts paid to our contract manufacturers  manufacturing  shipping and handling  provisions for product warranty  and inventory obsolescence  as well as overhead allocated to these activities 
operating expense operating expense consists of selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as expenses related to research and development  depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets 
these expenses also include compensation for employees in executive and operational functions including certain non cash charges related to expenses from option grants  facilities costs  professional fees  salaries  commissions  travel expense and related benefits of personnel engaged in sales  product management and marketing activities  costs of marketing programs and promotional materials  salaries  bonuses and related benefits of personnel engaged in our own research and development beyond the scope and activities of our technology development division  product development activities not provided under contracts with third parties  and overhead costs related to these activities 
litigation reserve as described elsewhere in this report  in april  as part of our litigation with hansen  a jury found in favor of hansen on certain of its claims against us and awarded a verdict for million against us 
we established a litigation reserve for this amount on our financial statements pending final resolution of the matter  which was recorded as other expense during the first quarter of in january  we concluded the settlement of our litigation with hansen and issued to hansen a secured promissory note in the principal amount of million as well as  shares of our common stock  with a fair value of approximately million  based on the closing price of our common stock on january  therefore  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the prior litigation reserve downward to million 
this adjustment was recorded on our statement of operations as a reduction of operating expenses during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents interest income expense on may   we canceled our senior secured revolving credit facility with first national bank  and entered into a new million debt facility with silicon valley bank 
at december   a million term loan was outstanding under this facility 
on july   we repaid the outstanding balance of our term loan with silicon valley bank and terminated the credit facility 
interest expense includes interest accrued on our outstanding bank credit facilities  interest costs associated with our senior convertible notes with outstanding principal of million as of december   and interest incurred with respect to our capital lease obligations 
interest income includes amounts earned on our cash deposits with financial institutions 
reorganization costs as described elsewhere in this report  in july  we filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  including a proposed joint plan of reorganization  which we refer to in this report as the reorganization plan  in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of virginia 
we amended the reorganization plan in december following our settlement with hansen 
in january  the bankruptcy court approved the reorganization plan  as amended 
reorganization costs of approximately million in our statement of operations for the year ended december  consists of legal fees and claims processing and other costs directly associated with our chapter proceedings 
as we emerged from bankruptcy in january  we do not anticipate any further significant reorganization costs beyond the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates technology development revenues we recognize revenue when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collectability of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is earned under cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
direct contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract and paid a fixed fee representing the profit negotiated between us and the contracting agency 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
revenue on time and materials contracts are recognized based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates and adding other billable direct costs 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance throughout a period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportional performance method and involve a specified number of deliverables  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of the cost of the deliverables compared to the cost of all deliverables included in the contract as this method more accurately measures performance under these arrangements 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the development and delivery of a specific prototype or product  revenues are recognized based upon the percentage of completion method 
our contracts with agencies of the government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the contract as the services are provided 
in evaluating the probability of funding for purposes of assessing collectability of the contract price  we consider our previous experience with our customers  communication with our customers regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  revenue recognition is deferred until realization is deemed probable 

table of contents contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation  including the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under the contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of normal management processes  facts may change  causing revisions to estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative impact of any revisions to estimates and the full impact of anticipated losses on any type of contract are recognized in the period in which they become known 
the underlying bases for estimating our contract research revenues are measurable expenses such as labor  subcontractor costs and materials  the cost data of which is updated on a regular basis for purposes of preparing our cost estimates 
our research contracts generally have a period of performance of six to months 
accordingly  our estimates of contract costs have historically been consistent with actual results 
revisions in these estimates between accounting periods to reflect changing facts and circumstances have not had a material impact on our operating results  and we do not expect future changes in these estimates to be material 
whether certain costs under government contracts are allowable is subject to audit by the government 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts using provisional or estimated indirect rates  which are subject to later revision based on government audits of those costs 
management is of the opinion that costs subsequently disallowed  if any  would not be significant 
product revenues we recognize revenue relating to our product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we evaluate product sales that are a part of multiple element revenue arrangements to determine whether separate units of accounting exist  and follow appropriate revenue recognition policies for each separate unit 
elements are considered separate units of accounting provided that i the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  iii if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within our control 
in certain product sales arrangements  we offer products bundled together at a discount 
we allocate the overall contract consideration among the separate units of accounting based upon their fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
we base the fair value of the undelivered items upon the normal pricing practice for those items  which is generally the price when sold separately 
we have concluded that our product sales do not include multiple deliverable elements  as we do not offer post contract customer support  technical services or upgrades and enhancements  or other related services  which would require deferring recognition of revenue relating to the product  absent the existence of fair value for any undelivered elements 
income taxes we estimate our tax liability through calculating our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we record on our balance sheet 
management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset  management considers factors such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary difference  taxable income in prior carry back years  whether carry back is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce their net carrying value 

table of contents as we assess our projections of future taxable income or other factors that may impact our ability to generate taxable income in future periods  our estimate of the required valuation allowance may change  which could have a material impact on future earnings or losses 
we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we establish a liability at the time we determine it is probable we will be required to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
these liabilities are recorded in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust such provision  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
we recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established liabilities as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
due to differences between federal or state tax law  and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  certain items are included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return 
some differences  such as depreciation expense reverse over time and create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense based upon the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of the grant 
the company has elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to value any awards granted 
we amortize stock based compensation for such awards on a straight line basis over the related service period of the awards taking into account the effects of the employees expected exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
to compute the volatility used in this model for options granted after november  we use the lifetime volatility of our common stock  because the stock has been publicly traded for over two years and thus provides sufficient data to determine volatility 
to compute the volatility used in this model for options granted prior to november  we used data from comparable companies 
as of december   total compensation expense not yet recognized related to unvested options is approximately million 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are instead reviewed annually or more frequently if necessary for impairment 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are required to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and are also required to be reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances warrant such a review 
we have elected to perform the annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year 
we employ income based methods of determining fair value of the reporting unit consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis 
as a result of the jury verdict against us during april  the company performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
the impairment indicated an impairment of the full carrying value of goodwill which we recognized during the quarter ended march  
table of contents long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
as a result of the jury verdict discussed above  we performed an impairment analysis related to our patents in our products and licensing segment  noting an impairment of the full carrying amounts of the patents  which we recognized during the quarter ended march  results of operations the following table shows information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented 
year ended december  revenues  technology development revenues product revenues total revenues cost of revenues technology development costs product costs total cost of revenues gross profit operating expense operating loss total other income  net loss before reorganization items and income tax reorganization costs loss before income taxes income tax expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing a decrease of million  or  versus revenues of million for the year ended december  the decrease was comprised of a million  or  decrease in technology development revenue and a million  or  decrease in product and license revenue 
technology development revenue decreased in by million 
we believe that the activities in this segment were adversely impacted by our chapter reorganization filed in july  which resulted in numerous expected awards for new development contracts being delayed until after our emergence from bankruptcy in product sales  product development  and licensing revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
product development activities included product development work for our arrangement with intuitive surgical  inc  and various arrangements with governmental entities 

table of contents revenues relating to product development activities were unchanged at million during the years ended december  and december  product sales revenue decreased to million during the year ended december   or  from million for the year ended december  the general deterioration of the global economy  which began to impact our product sales during the fourth quarter of  continued to have an adverse effect on product sales throughout most of cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for technology development decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease primarily resulted from reduced overhead expenses attributable to this business segment as a result of the company s initiatives during to improve efficiency and reduce its costs of operations 
product and license cost of revenues decreased million  or  largely attributable to the decrease in product sales during compared to operating expense operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over the increase in operating expense was driven by approximately million associated with the cost of settlement of our litigation with hansen 
expenses relating to professional fees and other costs associated with our litigation during the year ended december  were million compared to approximately million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  in addition to the cost of the hansen settlement described above 
expenses relating to share based compensation were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over share based compensation expenses of million for the year ended december  the increase in share based compensation was driven by an increase in the expense relating to options issued to employees during  which we account for at fair value 
other income expense for the year ended december   the company recognized other expense of million compared to other income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million in other income items 
this decrease was due primarily to an increase of million in interest expense  in addition to the benefits recognized in associated with million in net proceeds of a legal settlement and the recognition of million of income related to the partial satisfaction of the terms of a grant related to our nanomaterials facility 
in march  we received a  grant from the city of danville  virginia to be used for the expansion of economic and commercial growth within the city 
specifically   of the grant was to offset certain capital expenditures for leasehold improvements being made at our danville facility  and the remaining  for our creation of new jobs 
accordingly  we deferred the full  amount of the grant as a liability on our balance sheet until we were able to satisfy the grant conditions 
in december we received a determination letter from the city of danville indicating that we had met of the conditions of the grant relating to job creation and of the conditions of the grant relating to capital expenditures 
as a result  we 
table of contents recognized  of the grant proceeds as other income for the year ended december  and correspondingly reduced the deferred liability of  on our balance sheet 
we received further notification in that we had earned an additional approximately  and recorded this in other income 
on july   we were asked to repay  under the grant agreement based on a computation of the pro rata amount of capital expenditures falling below required levels 
we have classified this amount and the remaining unearned revenue of  as a current liability subject to compromise on our balance sheet as of december  in january  we agreed to pay back the  in quarterly installments over the next five years  ending in november reorganization expense we filed for reorganization on july  and we had no reorganization expenses for the year ended december  expenses relating to professional fees and other costs associated with our reorganization during the year ended december  were million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  over revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase was comprised of a million  or  increase in technology development revenue and a million  or  decrease in product and license revenue 
technology development revenue grew in due to additional contract awards 
a greater proportion of our labor costs were spent generating revenue in than in  which translated to increased revenue 
direct labor applied to billable contract activity increased from of total technology development labor dollars for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we believe that we improved the efficiency of our technology development labor during the year ended december  product sales  product development  and licensing revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  representing a decrease  or million  between these two years 
product development activities included product development work for our arrangement with intuitive surgical  inc  and various arrangements with governmental entities 
revenues relating to product development activities decreased to million during the year ended december   or from million during the year ended december  we attribute this decrease predominantly to changes in our estimates for the level of effort required to attain milestones in certain product development contracts 
when estimated costs to complete a contract increase  we reduce our revenues previously recognized 
we reduced revenues on a cumulative basis by approximately million for the three months ended march  and by approximately million for the three months ended december  due to such changes in estimates 
the decline in product development revenue was offset by an increase in the revenue realized from product sales for the year ended december  product sales revenue increased to million during the year ended december   or  from million for the year ended december  however  the general deterioration of the global economy began to impact our product sales during the three month period ended december  revenue from product sales for the nine months ended september  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to product revenue for the nine months ended september  of million 
however  revenue from the sale of our products for the three months ended december  decreased million  or  to million for the three months ended december   as compared to 
table of contents million for the three months ended december  the number of units sold on which we recognized revenue declined by to during the three months ended december  from during the three months ended december  cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for technology development increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the addition of personnel during to fulfill our awarded research contracts  a higher proportion of time expended on direct labor  and other direct costs associated with these contracts 
product and license cost of revenues increased million  or  largely attributable to the increases of cost of goods relating to the sale of products 
operating expense operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over the increase in operating expense was driven primarily by two factors in an increase in litigation expenses  and an increase in share based compensation expenses 
expenses relating to litigation for the year ended december  were approximately million  an increase of million  or  over litigation expenses for the year ended december  of million 
the expense increase is attributable to our dispute with hansen  which commenced in june expenses relating to share based compensation were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over share based compensation expenses of million for the year ended december  the increase in share based compensation was driven by an increase in the expense relating to options issued to employees  accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
expenses relating to these options increased due to an increase in the number of options granted during other income expense other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million in other income items  or approximately 
this increase was due primarily to the following transactions occurring during the year ended december  receipt of net proceeds of a legal settlement  and recognition of income from partial satisfaction of the terms of a grant from the city of danville 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our total cash and cash equivalents were approximately million 
we expect the settlement of our litigation with hansen in december and our emergence from bankruptcy in january will improve our cash flows in future years 
on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement the credit facility with silicon valley bank svb 
the credit facility is a revolving credit facility that provides us with borrowing capacity of up to million at a floating annual interest rate equal to the greater of a or b svb s prime rate then in effect plus 
the credit facility matures on february   unless earlier terminated  and any amounts outstanding under the credit facility will be secured by substantially all of our assets  including our intellectual property  personal property and bank accounts 
the credit facility includes a fee of one half of one percent per annum based on the average unused portion of the credit facility 

table of contents we have not yet drawn on the credit facility 
conditions to the initial extension of credit under the credit facility include  among others  the completion of an audit by svb with results satisfactory to svb in its sole discretion 
the credit facility requires us to observe a number of financial and operational covenants  including maintenance of a specified liquidity ratio  achievement of certain adjusted ebitda targets  protection and registration of intellectual property rights  and certain customary negative covenants 
if we draw on the credit facility  we may use the proceeds of the loans for any variety of purposes  including working capital and general corporate purposes 
in addition  the credit facility contains customary events of default  including nonpayment of principal  interest or other amounts  violation of covenants  material adverse change  an event of default under any subordinated debt documents  incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect  bankruptcy  judgments in excess of a threshold amount  and violations of other agreements in excess of a threshold 
if any event of default occurs svb may declare due immediately all borrowings under the credit facility and foreclose on the collateral 
furthermore  an event of default under the credit facility would result in an increase in the interest rate on any amounts outstanding 
hansen has agreed to subordinate its right to payment under the hansen note in favor of svb s right to payment under the credit facility  subject to certain terms and conditions 
we believe that our current cash balance in addition to the funds available to us under the credit facility provide adequate liquidity for us to meet our working capital needs during discussion of cash flows recent activity during the year ended december   we used approximately million of net cash from operations 
this was an increase of million compared to  when we used million of net cash from operations 
this change was due to increased cash expenditures for professional fees related to our litigation with hansen and our chapter reorganization activities 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  related to the purchase of the intellectual property assets of tego biosciences  and the capitalized legal fees and costs associated with securing patent rights to certain technology 
our overall cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in the change in cash flows reflects the receipt of cash under our term loan with silicon valley bank in and the repayment of that loan during at december   total cash and cash equivalents were approximately million 
we expect improved results of operations  resulting from the termination of our litigation with hansen and our emergence from chapter reorganization to result in improved cash flow in subsequent years  following the cash payment of prepetition liabilities and the remaining fees incurred with respect to the litigation and reorganization 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for property and equipment  including purchased assets  assets acquired under capital leases  and capitalized software  totaled million for  a decrease of million from capital expenditures of million in the decrease from to was principally due to decreased growth and upgrades to equipment in summary of contractual obligations we lease our facilities in blacksburg  charlottesville  danville  and roanoke  virginia under operating leases that expire between june and december or under a month to month arrangement 
upon expiration of the leases  we may exercise certain renewal options as specified in the leases 

table of contents in september  our products division executed a non cancelable  non reschedulable million purchase order for multiple shipments of tunable lasers to be delivered over an month period beginning in september as of december   approximately million of this commitment remained 
the delivery of the remaining lasers has been extended to months through june set forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations as of december  that are fixed and determinable 
total less than year years years more than years debt obligations hansen promissory note operating facility leases other operating leases purchase order obligation deferred credits city of danville grant other liabilities total long term debt obligations consist of senior convertible promissory notes of aggregate principal amount of million and accrued interest thereon held by carilion clinic 
the carilion clinic senior convertible promissory notes plus interest totaling million were exchanged for convertible preferred stock in january  in full satisfaction of our obligations under the convertible notes 
in march  we received a  grant from the city of danville  virginia to be used for the expansion of economic and commercial growth within the city 
specifically   of the grant was to be used to offset certain capital expenditures for leasehold improvements being made at our danville facility  and the remaining  was to be used for our creation of new jobs 
in december we received a determination letter from the city of danville that we had met of the grant relating to job creation  and relating to capital expenditures 
as a result  we recognized  of the grant as other income for the year ended december  in we recognized an additional approximately  in revenue 
in january we agreed to repay  of the remaining grant in quarterly installments through november the remainder of the unearned grant of  is under review at this time by the city of danville  and therefore callable anytime  and therefore this amount is included in the table above as an obligation payable in less than one year 
other liabilities include remaining amounts payable for minimum royalty payments for certain licensed technologies payable over the remaining patent terms of the underlying technology 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k  item a ii 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes or have any derivative financial instruments 
our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate fluctuations due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 

table of contents interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments as a hedge against interest rate fluctuations  and  as a result  interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is subject to changes in interest rates 
however  we believe that the impact of these fluctuations does not have a material effect on our financial position due to the immediate available liquidity or short term nature of these financial instruments 
as of december   we had million deposited in cash and cash equivalents bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations  as a result of our silicon valley bank term loan and revolving debt facility both having interest rates subject to market fluctuations 
we do not currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of any of our debt 
the interest rate on our new revolving debt facility entered into february  with silicon valley bank is at prime plus 
the revolving debt facility has a minimum interest rate of foreign currency exchange rate risk as of december   all payments made under our research contracts have been denominated in united states dollars 
our product sales to foreign customers are also denominated in us dollars  and we do not receive payments in foreign currency 
as such  we are not directly exposed to currency gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
