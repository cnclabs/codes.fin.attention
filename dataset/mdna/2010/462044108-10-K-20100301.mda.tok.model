seismic industry overview since the s  oil and gas companies have sought to reduce exploration risk by using seismic data to create an image of the earth s subsurface 
seismic data is recorded when listening devices placed on the earth s surface or seabed floor  or carried within the streamer cable of a towed streamer vessel  measure how long it takes for sound vibrations to echo off rock layers underground 
for seismic acquisition onshore  the acoustic energy producing the sound vibrations is generated by the detonation of small explosive charges or by large vibroseis vibrator vehicles 
in marine acquisition  the energy is provided by a series of air guns that deliver highly compressed air into the water column 
the acoustic energy propagates through the subsurface as a spherical wave front  or seismic wave 
interfaces between different types of rocks will both reflect and transmit this wave front 
onshore  the reflected signals return to the surface where they are measured by sensitive receivers that may be either analog coil spring geophones or digital accelerometers based on mems micro electro mechanical systems technology  offshore  the reflected signals are recorded by either hydrophones towed in an array behind a streamer acquisition vessel or by multicomponent geophones or mems sensors that are placed directly on the seabed 
once the recorded seismic energy is processed using advanced algorithms and workflows  images of the subsurface can be created to depict the structure  lithology rock type  fracture patterns  and fluid content of subsurface horizons  highlighting the most promising places to drill for oil and natural gas 
this processing also aids in engineering decisions  such as drilling and completion methods  as well as decisions affecting overall reservoir production 
typically  an e p company engages the services of a geophysical acquisition company to prepare site locations  coordinate logistics  and acquire seismic data in a selected area 
the e p company generally relies upon third parties  such as ion  to provide the contractor with equipment  navigation and data management software  and field support services necessary for data acquisition 
after the data is collected  the same geophysical contractor  a third party data processing company  the company s data processing service or the e p company itself will process the data using proprietary algorithms and workflows to create a series of seismic images 
geoscientists then interpret the data by reviewing the images and integrating the geophysical data with other geological and production information such as well logs or core information 
during the s  digital seismic data acquisition systems which converted the analog output from the geophones into digital data for recording and computers for seismic data processing were introduced 
using the new systems and computers  the signals could be recorded on magnetic tape and sent to data processors where they could be adjusted and corrected for known distortions 
the final processed data was displayed in a form known as stacked data 
computer filing  storage  database management  and algorithms used to process the raw data quickly grew more sophisticated  dramatically increasing the amount of subsurface seismic information 
until the early s  the primary commercial seismic imaging technology was two dimensional  or d  technology 
d seismic data is recorded using straight lines of receivers crossing the surface of the earth 
once processed  d seismic data allows geoscientists to see only a thin vertical slice of the earth 
a geoscientist using d seismic technology must speculate on the characteristics of the earth between the slices and attempt to visualize the true three dimensional d structure of the subsurface 
the commercial development of d imaging technology in the early s was an important technological milestone for the seismic industry 
previously  the high cost of d seismic data acquisition techniques and the lack of computing power necessary to process  display  and interpret d data on a commercial basis had slowed its widespread adoption 
today s d seismic techniques record the reflected energy across a series of closely spaced seismic lines that collectively provide a more holistic  spatially sampled depiction of geological horizons and  in some cases  rock and fluid properties  within the earth 
d seismic data and the associated computer based interpretation platforms are designed to allow geoscientists to generate more accurate subsurface maps than could be constructed on the basis of the more widely spaced d seismic lines 
in particular  d seismic data provided more detailed information about subsurface structures  including the geometry of bedding layers  salt structures  and fault planes 
the improved d seismic images allowed the oil and gas industry to discover new reservoirs  reduce finding and development costs  and lower overall hydrocarbon exploration risk 
driven by faster computers and more sophisticated mathematical equations to process the data  the technology advanced quickly 
as commodity prices decreased and the pace of innovation in d seismic imaging technology slowed in the late s  e p companies slowed the commissioning of new seismic surveys 
also  business practices employed by geophysical contractors in the s impacted demand for seismic data 
in an effort to sustain higher utilization of existing capital assets  geophysical contractors increasingly began to collect speculative seismic data for their own account in the hopes of selling it later to e p companies 
contractors typically selected an area  acquired data using generic acquisition parameters and generic processing algorithms  capitalized the acquisition costs  and attempted to sell the survey results to multiple e p companies 
these generic  speculative  multi client surveys were not tailored to meet the unique imaging objectives of individual clients and caused an oversupply of seismic data in many regions 
additionally  since contractors incurred most of the costs of this speculative seismic data at the time of acquisition  contractors lowered prices to recover as much of their fixed investment as possible  which drove operating margins down 
as commodity prices increased beginning in  e p companies increased their capital investment programs  which drove higher demand for our products and services 
crude oil prices increased to record levels of per barrel in july  but  in conjunction with the global recession sharply declined after that  fell to approximately per barrel during the first quarter of by the end of  oil prices had recovered to approximately per barrel 
natural gas prices followed a similar  recession induced downturn 
after peaking at per mmbtu in july  henry hub natural gas prices fell approximately 
unlike the recent recovery of oil prices  natural gas prices have remained depressed due in part to the excess supply of natural gas in the market 
these conditions sharply curtailed demand for exploration activities in north america and in other regions 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information 
ion geophysical s business strategy factors affecting long term demand 
beginning in and continuing until  we observed increased spending for seismic services and equipment by e p companies and seismic contractors  driven in part by an increase in commodity prices 
a decline in the number and size of new discoveries  production declines in known reservoirs  and expanded demand for hydrocarbons had increased the pressure on e p companies to discover additional fields and optimize the recovery of those already on production 
until the fourth quarter of  this increasing exploration activity combined with higher commodity price levels increased the demand for seismic technology and services 
the recent global recession that began in reduced the demand for and associated prices of hydrocarbons  which has adversely affected our business and results of operations 
however  we believe that several factors are in place that will reverse the downturn in seismic spending for the years ahead 
these factors include the following demand for both crude oil and natural gas should continue to increase as the financial health of developed country economies gradually improves  and as demand in high growth emerging markets  like china and india  returns to or exceeds previous levels  e p companies are focusing more on hydrocarbon reservoirs that are located in deeper waters or deeper in the geologic column 
these reservoirs are generally more complex or subtle than the reservoirs that were discovered in prior decades and are located in unconventional reservoir types  such as tar sand deposits or tight gas locked within hard rock or low permeability shales 
as a result  the process of finding and developing these hydrocarbon deposits is proving to be more challenging  which in turn results in escalating costs and increasing demands for newer and more efficient imaging technologies  and e p companies are increasingly using seismic data to enhance production from known fields by repeating time lapse seismic surveys over a defined area 
this trend should benefit seismic companies such as ion by extending the utility of subsurface imaging beyond exploration and into production monitoring  which can last for decades 
we believe that e p companies will  in the future  increasingly use seismic technology providers who will collaborate with them to tailor surveys that address specific geophysical problems and to apply advanced digital sensor and imaging technologies to take into account the geologic peculiarities of a specific area 
in the future  we expect that these e p companies will rely less on undifferentiated  mass seismic studies created using analog sensors and traditional processing technologies that do not adequately identify geologic complexities 
becoming a broad based seismic provider 
two acquisitions in were important in our evolution from being primarily a seismic equipment provider to becoming a broad based seismic solutions company our acquisition of concept systems holdings limited concept systems and its integrated planning  navigation  command control  and data management software and solutions for towed streamer and seabed operations  and our acquisition of gx technology corporation gxt  and its advanced seismic data imaging solutions services and seismic data libraries for the marine environment 
additionally  in september  we further expanded our land system offerings through the acquisition of aram systems ltd 
and canadian seismic rentals inc sometimes collectively referred to herein as aram 
we acquired aram for the purpose of advancing our strategy and market penetration in the land seismic recording system business 
through these and other acquisitions  along with our research and development efforts  our technologies and services now include seismic data acquisition hardware  command and control software  value added services associated with seismic survey design  seismic data processing and interpretation  and seismic data libraries 
responses to the global downturn 
the dramatic economic changes that occurred in the fourth quarter of and continued through caused us to re evaluate and refine our business strategy 
the disruption in the us financial markets prompted a global economic crisis that adversely affected economic activity in most regions of the world and led to a tightening of the availability of commercial credit 
many economists are now predicting a gradual recovery from the prolonged worldwide economic recession and a slow recovery in the credit markets 
crude oil prices rapidly declined from a peak oil price of per barrel in july to approximately per barrel in the first quarter of hydrocarbon price erosion caused e p companies to decrease their capital expenditure plans for exploration and production activities  which  in turn  adversely impacted the demand for many of our products and services 
natural gas prices followed a similar  recession induced downturn 
after peaking at per mmbtu in july  henry hub natural gas prices fell approximately 
unlike the recent recovery of oil prices  natural gas prices have remained depressed due in part to the excess supply of natural gas in the market 
these conditions sharply curtailed demand for exploration activities in north america and in other regions 
unlike many other seismic companies  we participate in the technology side of the business and are mainly involved in the planning  processing and interpretation of data services 
we are not in the field crew business  and therefore do not have large amounts of capital and other resources invested in vessels or other assets necessary to support contracted seismic data acquisition services  nor do we have large manufacturing facilities 
our costs are therefore much more variable than most other seismic companies  which provides greater flexibility in difficult economic times 
nonetheless  the global economic crisis  combined with the decline in crude oil and natural gas prices  adversely affected us in all of our business segments saw decreases in revenues  with some segments experiencing significant decreases 
our total net revenues declined from our total net revenues 
our acquisition of aram in and the million of debt financing that we incurred to finance the acquisition over leveraged our company 
as a result  we reacted by implementing numerous cost savings programs  including reducing our company wide employee headcount by approximately 
we also began considering strategic alternatives 
in the summer of  we commenced negotiations with bgp for a joint venture for our land equipment business  and announced the signing of a binding term sheet for such a joint venture on october  see products and services ion systems division proposed land equipment joint venture with bgp 
our cost reduction initiatives were necessary in order to adjust to the reduced levels in demand and to align with changes in our overall strategy 
for example  the severe slowdown in sales activity for our land acquisition systems in north america and russia 
caused our largest headcount reductions to be concentrated within our land imaging systems segment 
we believe that our current headcount is sufficient to manage our business and serve our customers needs during  but we may make further adjustments as market conditions and our strategy dictate 
our employee headcount will be further reduced once we close the bgp joint venture transactions  employees previously dedicated to the joint venture businesses are expected to become employees within the joint venture 
in addition to analyzing our employee resources  we have evaluated current and planned internal and external programs  including research and development  to ensure that each program is serving a worthwhile goal in the most efficient manner 
we are a technology solutions company and we rely upon our research and development programs to ensure that we offer products capable of solving seismic imaging problems around the world efficiently 
the recent declines in oil and natural gas prices do not change the data indicating that the oil and gas industry still suffers from declines in the number and size of new discoveries and production declines in known reservoirs 
these facts  combined with growing global demographics  support a conclusion of continuing long term demand for hydrocarbons 
in the current difficult economic environment  we believe that our technologies and services are ideal tools for e p companies seeking ways to be more productive in a lower price environment 
as a result  we have focused much of our research and development efforts on strategic programs that are seeking efficient and cost effective solutions for the challenges in the current market and also in a recovered economy 
a key element of our business strategy  which began with our acquisition of gxt in  has been to understand the challenges faced by e p companies in survey planning  acquisition  processing and even interpretation  and to strive to develop and offer technology and services that enable us to work with the e p companies to solve their challenges 
we have found that a collaborative relationship with e p companies  with a goal of better understanding their imaging challenges and then working with them and our contractor customers to assure that the right technologies are properly applied  is the most effective method for meeting our customers needs 
this strategy of being a full solutions provider to solve the most difficult challenges for our customers is an important element of our long term business strategy  and we are implementing this approach globally through local personnel in our regional organizations who understand the unique challenges in their areas 
the rapid decline of oil and natural gas prices in late and continuing through has made it even more important for the e p industry to reduce the number of dry holes and to optimize the wells that are successful 
e p companies continue to be interested in technology to increase production and in improving their understanding of targeted reservoirs  in both the exploration and production phases 
we believe that our new technologies  such as firefly  digifin and orca  will continue to attract interest because they are designed to deliver improvements in image quality within more productive delivery systems 
for more information regarding our products and services  see products and services below 
in summary  our business strategy is predicated on successfully executing seven key imperatives increasing our market share and profitability in land acquisition systems and furthering the commercialization of firefly  our cableless full wave land data acquisition system  and our other land equipment technologies through our participation in the proposed land equipment joint venture with bgp  continuing to manage our cost structure to reflect current market and economic conditions while keeping key strategic technology programs progressing with an overall goal of enabling e p companies to solve their complex reservoir problems most efficiently and effectively  expanding our ion solutions business in new regions with new customers and new land and marine service offerings  including proprietary services for owners and operators of oil and gas properties  globalizing our ion solutions data processing business by opening advanced imaging centers in strategic locations  and expanding our presence in the land seismic processing segment  with emphasis on serving the national oil companies  developing and introducing our next generation of marine towed streamer products  with a goal of developing markets beyond the new vessel market  expanding our seabed imaging solutions business using our vectorseis ocean vso acquisition system platform and derivative products to obtain technical and market leadership in what we continue to believe is a very important and expanding market  and leveraging our proposed land equipment joint venture with bgp to design and deliver lower cost  more reliable land imaging systems to our worldwide customer base of land acquisition contractors while concurrently tapping into a broader set of global geophysical opportunities associated with the exploration  asset development  and production operations of bgp s parent  cnpc 
full wave digital our seismic data acquisition products and services are well suited for traditional d  d  and d data collection as well as more advanced multicomponent or full wave digital seismic data collection techniques 
conventional geophone sensors are based on a mechanical  coil spring magnet arrangement 
the single component geophone measures ground motion in one direction  even though reflected energy in the earth travels in multiple directions 
this type of geophone can capture only pressure waves p waves 
p waves represent only a portion of the full seismic wavefield 
conventional geophones have limitations in collecting shear waves s waves  which involve a component of particle motion that is orthogonal to the direction of wave propagation a more horizontal component of motion 
in addition  geophones require accurate placement both vertically and spatially 
inaccurate placement  which can result from poorly planned surveys or human error  can introduce distortions that negatively affect the final subsurface image 
multicomponent seismic sensors are designed to record the full seismic wavefield by measuring reflected seismic energy in three directions 
this vector based measurement enables multicomponent sensors to record not only p wave data  but also to record shear waves 
ion s vectorseis sensor was developed using mems accelerometer technology to enable a true vector measurement of all seismic energy reflected in the subsurface 
vectorseis is designed to capture the entire seismic signal and more faithfully record all wavefields traveling within the earth 
by measuring both p waves and s waves  the vectorseis full wave sensor records a more complete and accurate seismic dataset having higher frequency content than conventional sensors 
when data recorded by vectorseis is processed using the advanced imaging techniques offered by our gxt imaging solutions group  we are able to deliver higher definition images of the subsurface to our oil and gas customers  which enables geophysicists to better identify subtle structural  rock  and fluid oriented features in the earth 
in addition  we believe that full wave technologies should deliver improved operating efficiencies in field acquisition and reduce cycle times across the seismic workflow  from planning through acquisition and final image rendering 
vectorseis acquires full wave seismic data in both land and marine environments using a portfolio of advanced imaging platforms manufactured by ion scorpion our cable based land acquisition system  vectorseis ocean vso our redeployable ocean bottom cable system for the seabed  and firefly our cableless full wave land acquisition system

products and services see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary for a list of certain developments in our business in and early ion systems division land imaging systems products products for our land imaging systems business segment include the following land acquisition systems 
our cable based scorpion and aries land acquisition systems consist of a central recording unit and multiple remote ground equipment modules that are connected by cable 
the central recording unit is in a transportable enclosure that serves as the control center of each system and is typically mounted within a vehicle or helicopter 
the central recording unit receives digitized data  stores the data on storage media for subsequent processing  and displays the data on optional monitoring devices 
it also provides calibration  status  and test functionality 
the remote ground equipment consists of multiple remote modules and line taps positioned over the survey area 
seismic data is collected by analog geophones or vectorseis digital sensors 
our aries product line was acquired in connection with our acquisition of aram in september the product line consists of analog cable based land acquisition systems and related peripherals and equipment 
aries land system products include remote acquisition modules rams  which acquire analog seismic data from the geophones and transmit the data digitally to the central processing equipment  and line tap units that interconnect baseline cables from the recording equipment to multiple receiver lines and function to retransmit data from the rams to central recording equipment 
aries products also include system batteries standard sealed or lithium ion  central recording equipment including seismic processing module and aram software  baseline cables that connect the central recording equipment with the taps and receiver line cables that connect geophones or hydrophone groups to a ram 
in november  ion launched its latest version of aries 
known as aries ii  this updated land recording system features a bit system architecture that is designed to dramatically improve channel capacity  ensure efficient equipment deployment  and maximize system performance 
scorpion is capable of recording full wave seismic data 
digital sensors can provide increased response linearity and bandwidth  which translates into higher resolution images of the subsurface 
in addition  one digital sensor can replace a string of six or more analog geophones  providing users with equipment weight reduction and improved operating efficiencies 
we began vectorseis technology land acquisition field tests in  and since that time vectorseis technology has been used to acquire seismic data in north america  europe  asia  the pacific basin region  the middle east  and the commonwealth of independent states 
in  we introduced our vectorseis system four land acquisition system 
in  we announced the introduction of our new hybrid system four platform  which gave seismic companies the flexibility to use both traditional analog geophone sensors and digital full wave vectorseis sensors on the same survey 
vectorseis is also used as the primary sensor device on our firefly cableless land acquisition system 
in november  we announced our development of firefly  a cableless system for full wave land seismic data acquisition 
by removing the constraints of cables  geophysicists can custom design surveys for multiple subsurface targets and increase receiver station density to more fully sample the subsurface 
we believe that the cableless design of firefly will improve field productivity while reducing concerns for health and safety and environmental liability exposure 
firefly s benefits include a decrease in system weight and  we believe  superior operational efficiencies  reduction in operational troubleshooting time  and better defined sampled seismic data 
also  we believe that the data management capabilities of firefly should reduce the amount of time spent pre processing the data 
during late and  we delivered version of our firefly system  which was used by british petroleum and then apache corporation  in field application projects located in wyoming and northeast texas  respectively 
an advanced version of our firefly system was successfully deployed in july on a multi client survey in northwest colorado in which pittsburgh based e p operator  east resources  served as the lead underwriter 
this initial deployment of version of our firefly system was called durham ranch  after one of the large  privately held ranches in this ecologically sensitive area 
in  ion sold a version firefly system  which is being used in a producing hydrocarbon basin containing reservoirs that have been difficult to image with conventional seismic techniques 
during  our version firefly system was utilized on nine surveys shot in three continents  including two high channel count  multicomponent full wave seismic acquisition programs in northeast texas and three projects in mexico with compania mexicana de exploraciones comesa  an oilfield services company majority owned by pemex  the national oil company of mexico 
geophones 
geophones are analog sensor devices that measure acoustic energy reflected from rock layers in the earth s subsurface using a mechanical  coil spring element 
we market a full suite of geophones and geophone test equipment that operate in most environments  including land  transition zone  and downhole 
we believe our sensor group is the leading designer and manufacturer of precision geophones used in seismic data acquisition 
our analog geophones are used in other industries as well 
in january  we announced that our land sensors business unit had commercialized a new  high performance geophone the sm xl  which features a simplified product design to deliver enhanced durability in the field and to record high quality acoustic data for customers

proposed land equipment joint venture with bgp our binding term sheet with bgp contemplates that we will enter into a purchase agreement with bgp to form the joint venture 
we expect to form the joint venture entity as a wholly owned subsidiary of ion geophysical corporation and will contribute to the joint venture certain assets and related liabilities that relate to the proposed joint venture business 
then  bgp will acquire a equity interest from us in the joint venture for an aggregate purchase price of million cash  and will contribute to the joint venture certain of its assets and related liabilities that relate to the joint venture s business 
the assets of each party to be contributed to the joint venture will include seismic recording systems  inventory  certain intellectual property rights and contract rights  all as may be necessary to or principally used in the conduct or operation of the businesses to be contributed to the joint venture as presently conducted or operated by each party 
the company expects the value assigned to the joint venture to exceed the company s current book value of its land equipment businesses 
the scope of the joint venture s business will be to design  develop  engineer and manufacture  and conduct research and development  distribution  sales and marketing and field support operations  of land based equipment used in seismic data acquisition for the petroleum industry

all of our other businesses including our marine imaging systems  data management solutions and ion solutions which includes gxt s imaging solutions  integrated seismic solutions iss and basinspan and seismic data libraries will remain owned and operated by us and will not comprise a part of the joint venture 
a key part of the strategy behind the joint venture will be to leverage our research and development experience and expertise with the operational experience and expertise of bgp 
it is expected that the r d centers will remain primarily in the us and canada and much of the land equipment manufacturing operations will move to china in order to reduce costs 
in addition  bgp s crews will be able to field test new technology and related equipment for operational feedback and quality improvements 
finally  we expect that bgp will purchase the majority of its land equipment from the joint venture and will purchase ion products and services from our other business segments 
closing and formation of the joint venture is expected to occur in march marine imaging systems products products for our marine imaging systems business segment include the following marine acquisition systems 
our traditional marine acquisition system consists of towed marine streamers and shipboard electronics that collect seismic data in water depths greater than meters 
marine streamers  which contain hydrophones  electronic modules and cabling  may measure up to  meters in length and are towed up to at a time behind a towed streamer seismic acquisition vessel 
the hydrophones detect acoustical energy transmitted through water from the earth s subsurface structures 
our digistreamer tm system  our next generation towed streamer system  was successfully commissioned at the start of the north sea season in another digistreamer system was delivered during  and a third digistreamer system was delivered in digistreamer uses solid streamer and continuous acquisition technology for towed streamer operations 
during  we introduced our vectorseis ocean vso system  an advanced system for seismic data acquisition using redeployable ocean bottom cable  and we shipped the first system to reservoir exploration technology  asa rxt  a norwegian seismic contractor 
since then  we have delivered five vso systems to rxt 
in  we entered into a multi year agreement with rxt under which rxt agreed to purchase a minimum of million in vso systems and related equipment from us through through december   rxt has purchased a total of million of vso systems and related equipment toward their commitment 
the agreement entitles us to receive a royalty of of all revenues generated by rxt through the use of vso equipment from january through the end of the term of the agreement  which  in and  was million and million  respectively 
the agreement granted rxt exclusive rights to the vso product line through because they did not purchase the minimum annual quantity of equipment  in february we notified rxt that they no longer have exclusive rights to the vso product line 
marine positioning systems 
our digicourse marine streamer positioning system includes streamer cable depth control devices  lateral control devices  compasses  acoustic positioning systems  and other auxiliary sensors 
this equipment is designed to control the vertical and horizontal positioning of the streamer cables and provides acoustic  compass  and depth measurements to allow processors to tie navigation and location data to geophysical data to determine the location of potential hydrocarbon reserves 
digifin is an advanced lateral streamer control system that we commercialized in we delivered a total of nine digifin systems in with an additional systems delivered in digifin is designed to maintain tighter  more uniform marine streamer separation along the entire length of the streamer cable  which allows for better sampling of seismic data and improved subsurface images 
we believe that digifin also enables faster line changes and minimize the requirements for in fill seismic work 
source and source control systems 
we manufacture and sell air guns  which are the primary seismic energy source used in marine environments to initiate the acoustic energy transmitted through the earth s subsurface 
an air gun fires a high compression burst of air underwater to create an energy wave for seismic measurement 
we offer a digital source control system digishot  which allows for reliable control of air gun arrays for d exploration activities 
data management solutions products and services through this segment  we supply software systems and services for towed marine streamer and seabed operations 
software developed by our subsidiary  concept systems  is installed on towed streamer marine vessels worldwide and is a component of many redeployable and permanent seabed monitoring systems 
products and services for our data management solutions business segment include the following marine imaging

ion solutions division services services for our ion solutions business segment include the following seismic data processing services 
the gxt imaging solutions group provides a variety of seismic data processing and imaging services to e p companies for marine  ocean bottom and land environments 
services include survey planning and design  project oversight of data acquisition operations  advanced signal processing  final image rendering  and geophysical and reservoir analysis 
the gxt imaging solutions group offers processing and imaging services through which it develops a series of subsurface images by applying its processing technology to data owned or licensed by its customers 
the group also provides support services to its customers  such as data pre conditioning for imaging and outsourced management of seismic data acquisition and image processing services 
the gxt imaging solutions group uses parallel computer clusters to process seismic data by applying advanced proprietary algorithms and workflows that incorporate techniques such as illumination analysis  data conditioning and velocity modeling  and time and depth migration 
pre stack depth migration involves the application of advanced  computer intensive processing techniques which convert time based seismic information to a depth basis 
while pre stack depth migration is not necessary in every imaging situation  it generally provides the most accurate subsurface images in areas of complex geology 
it also helps to convert seismic data  which is recorded in the time domain  into a depth domain format that is more readily applied by geologists and reservoir engineers in identifying well locations 
our reverse time migration rtm technology was developed to improve imaging in areas where complex structural conditions or steeply dipping subsurface horizons have provided imaging challenges for oil and gas companies 
our axis geophysics group axis  based in denver  colorado  focuses on advanced seismic data processing for stratigraphically complex onshore environments 
axis has developed a proprietary data processing technique called azim that is designed to better account for the anisotropic effects of the earth ie  different layers of geological formations that are not parallel to each other  which tend to distort seismic images 
azim is designed to correct for these anisotropic effects by producing higher resolution images in areas where the velocity of seismic waves varies with compass direction or azimuth 
the azim technique is used to analyze fracture patterns within reservoirs 
we believe that the application of ion s advanced processing technologies and imaging techniques can better identify complex hydrocarbon bearing structures and deeper exploration prospects 
we also believe that the combination of gxt s capabilities in advanced velocity model building and depth imaging  along with axis capability in anisotropic imaging  provides an advanced toolkit for maximizing the data measurements obtained by our vectorseis full wave sensor 
integrated seismic solutions iss 
ion s iss services are designed to manage the entire seismic process  from survey planning and design to data acquisition and management  through pre processing and final subsurface imaging 
the iss group focuses on the technologically intensive components of the image development process  such as survey planning and design and data processing and interpretation  and outsources the logistics component to geophysical logistics contractors 
ion offers its iss services to customers on both a proprietary and multi client basis 
on both bases  the customers pre fund a majority of the data acquisition costs 
with the proprietary service  the customer also pays for the imaging and processing  but has exclusive ownership of the data after it has been processed 
for multi client surveys  we assume some of the processing costs but retain ownership of the data and images and receive on going license revenue from subsequent data license sales 
seismic data libraries 
since  gxt has acquired and processed a growing seismic data library consisting of non exclusive marine and ocean bottom data from around the world 
the majority of the data libraries licensed by gxt consist of ultra deep d lines that e p companies use to better evaluate the evolution of petroleum systems at the basin level  including insights into the character of source rocks and sediments  migration pathways  and reservoir trapping mechanisms 
in many cases  the availability of geoscience data extends beyond seismic information to include magnetic  gravity  well log  and electromagnetic information  which help to provide a more comprehensive picture of the subsurface 
known as spans  these geophysical data libraries currently exist for major offshore basins worldwide  including the northern gulf of mexico  the southern caribbean  the north and east coasts of south america  the east and west coasts of west africa  the east and west coasts of india  northern canada and alaska and southeast asia 
in  we completed the acquisition of new basinspan surveys offshore argentina  northeast greenland and southern australia 
additionally  in january  we completed the acquisition of an additional  km of regional seismic data covering brazil s southern santos  pelotas and northeastern equatorial basins  this brings our total basin scale seismic library offshore brazil to more than  kilometers of data acquired 
non seismic surveys employing gravity gradiometry and magnetic technology were also acquired over northern canada and the gulf coast 
additional spans and other seismic and non seismic programs are planned or under development for other regions of the world 
product research and development our research and development efforts have focused on improving both the quality of the subsurface image and the seismic data acquisition economics for our customers 
our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic equipment and data acquisition systems  as well as related processing services  depends principally upon continued technological innovation 
development cycles of most products  from initial conception through commercial introduction  may extend over several years 
in  we principally focused our research and development efforts on commercialization of our firefly system and on digistreamer  our solid streamer cable for marine acquisition 
during  we expect that our product development efforts will continue across selective business lines aimed at the development of strategic key products and technologies 
major research and development programs are expected to continue for firefly  our digi line of marine streamer technologies  our cable based land systems and our land energy source technologies 
a key research and development initiative is underway to integrate firefly with our cable based land recording systems in order to provide contractors with a hybrid architecture for cabled and cableless recording on the same survey 
we also are investing to develop hybrid sensor functionality for both firefly designing the current all digital system to be compatible with analog geophones and our aries ii land acquisition system designing its current all analog system to be compatible with vectorseis 
for a summary of our research and development expenditures during the past five years  see item selected financial data 
because many of these new products are under development  their commercial feasibility or degree of commercial acceptance  if any  is not yet known 
no assurance can be given concerning the successful development of any new products or enhancements  the specific timing of their release or their level of acceptance in the marketplace 
markets and customers based on historical revenues  we believe that we are a market leader in numerous product lines  including geophones  full wave sensors based upon micro electro magnetic systems mems  navigation and data management software  marine positioning and streamer control systems  cableless land acquisition systems and redeployable seabed recording systems 
our principal customers are seismic contractors and e p companies 
seismic contractors purchase our data acquisition systems and related equipment and software to collect data in accordance with their e p company customers specifications or for their own seismic data libraries 
we also market and sell products and offer services directly to e p companies  primarily imaging related processing services and multi client seismic data libraries from our gxt subsidiary  as well as consulting services from concept systems and gxt 
during the years ended december   and  no single customer accounted for or more of our consolidated net revenues 
hydrocarbon price erosion has caused e p companies to revisit their capital investment plans  which  in turn  is reverberating back through the supply chain to affect us both directly and indirectly through our seismic acquisition contractor customers 
contractors from china including bgp and other countries are increasingly active not only in their own countries but also in other international markets 
as a result  a significant part of our marketing effort is focused on areas outside of the united states 
foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the united states  including the risk of armed conflict  civil disturbances  currency fluctuations  embargo and governmental activities  customer credit risks  and risk of non compliance with us and foreign laws  including tariff regulations and import export restrictions 
we sell our products and services through a direct sales force consisting of employees and international third party sales representatives responsible for key geographic areas 
during the years ended december   and  sales to destinations outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net revenues  respectively 
further  systems sold to domestic customers are frequently deployed internationally and  from time to time  certain foreign sales require export licenses 
we have consolidated our international sales at our sales facility operating in dubai 
dubai is geographically better positioned to ensure that we are close to our customers in one of the most active oil and gas centers of the world 
traditionally  our business has been seasonal  with strongest demand in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
for information concerning the geographic breakdown of our net revenues  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing outsourcing and suppliers since  we have increased the use of contract manufacturers in our land and marine imaging systems business segments as an alternative to manufacturing our own products 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of our vibrator vehicles  our towed marine streamers  our redeployable ocean bottom cables  various components of vectorseis ocean and certain electronic and ground components of our land acquisition systems 
we may experience supply interruptions  cost escalations  and competitive disadvantages if we do not monitor these relationships properly 
these contract manufacturers purchase a substantial portion of the components used in our systems and products from third party vendors 
certain items  such as integrated circuits used in our systems  are purchased from sole source vendors 
although we and our contract manufacturers attempt to maintain an adequate inventory of these single source items  the loss of ready access to any of these items could temporarily disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell certain products 
since our components are designed for use with these single source items  replacing the single source items with functional equivalents could require a redesign of our components and costly delays could result 
in  we transferred ownership of our subsidiary  applied mems  inc  to colibrys ltd 
colibrys  a swiss mems based technology firm  in exchange for a ownership interest in colibrys 
we concurrently entered into a five year supply agreement with colibrys that provided for colibrys to supply us with products on an exclusive basis in our markets 
colibrys manufactures mems products  including accelerometers  for our vectorseis sensors  and for other applications  including test and measurement  earthquake and structural monitoring  and defense 
in december  our five year supply agreement with colibrys expired  and we currently have no plans to enter into a new supply agreement with colibrys for the products that were covered by the agreement 
as of december   we estimate we have three to four years supply of sensor inventory 
competition the market for seismic products and services is highly competitive and is characterized by continual changes in technology 
our principal competitor for land and marine seismic equipment is societe d etudes recherches et construction electroniques sercel  an affiliate of the french seismic contractor  compagnie general de geophysique veritas cggveritas 
sercel possesses the advantage of being able to sell its products and services to an affiliated seismic contractor that operates both land crews and seismic acquisition vessels  providing it with a greater ability to test new technology in the field and to capture a captive internal market for product sales 
sercel has also demonstrated that it is willing to offer extended financing sales terms to customers in situations where we declined to do so due to credit risk 
we also compete with other seismic equipment companies on a product by product basis 
our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic instruments and data acquisition systems depends principally upon continued technological innovation  as well as pricing  system reliability  reputation for quality  and ability to deliver on schedule 
certain seismic contractors have designed  engineered  and manufactured seismic acquisition technology in house or through a controlled network of third party vendors in order to achieve differentiation versus their competition 
for example  westerngeco a wholly owned subsidiary of schlumberger limited  a large integrated oilfield services company relies heavily on its in house technology development for designing  engineering  and manufacturing its q technology platform  which includes seismic acquisition and processing systems 
although this technology competes directly with ion s technology for marine streamer  seabed  and land acquisition  westerngeco does not provide q technology services to other seismic acquisition contractors 
however  the risk exists that other seismic contractors may decide to conduct more of their own seismic technology development  which would put additional pressures on the demand for ion acquisition equipment 
in addition  over the last several years  we have seen both new build and consolidation activity within the marine towed streamer segment  which could impact our business results in the future 
we expect the number of d and d marine streamer vessels  including those in operation  under construction  or announced additions to capacity  to increase to approximately by year end  compared to approximately at december  in addition  there has been an increase in acquisition activity within the sector  with the major vessel operators schlumberger  cggveritas  and pgs all moving to acquire new market entrants in the last several years 
many of these incumbent operators develop their own marine streamer technologies  such that consolidation in the sector reduces the number of potential customers and vessel outfitting opportunities for us 
our gxt imaging solutions group competes with more than a dozen processing companies that are capable of providing pre stack depth migration services to e p companies 
see products and services ion solutions division services 
while the barriers to entry into this market are relatively low  the barriers to competing at the higher end of the market  which is the advanced pre stack depth migration market  where our efforts are focused  are significantly higher 
at the higher end of this market  cggveritas and westerngeco are ion solutions division s two primary competitors for advanced imaging services 
both of these companies are larger than ion in terms of revenues  number of processing locations  and sales and marketing resources 
in addition  both cggveritas and westerngeco possess an advantage of being part of affiliated seismic contractor companies  providing them with access to customer relationships and seismic datasets that require processing 
concept systems provides advanced data integration software and services to seismic contractors acquiring data using either towed streamer vessels or ocean bottom cable on the seabed 
vessels or ocean bottom cable crews that do not use concept systems software either rely upon manual data integration  reconciliation  and quality control  or develop and maintain their own proprietary software packages 
there is evidence of growing competition to concept systems core command and control business from sercel and other smaller companies 
concept systems has recently signed long term between two and five years technology partnerships with many of its key clients and will continue to seek to develop key new technologies with these clients 
an important competitive factor for companies in the same business as concept systems is the ability to provide advanced complex command and control software with a high level of reliability combined with expert systems and project support to ensure operations run cost effectively 
in the land systems market  ion is the second largest provider of cable based land systems worldwide  trailing only sercel 
in the cableless market  several companies have introduced technologies that compete  directly or indirectly  with firefly  including sercel  ascend geo  oyo geospace  fairfield  and wireless seismic 
each company is attempting to implement a cableless architecture in a slightly different way  with variations related to how the telemetry data communications backbone works  whether the system can use digital  full wave sensors or only analog geophones  and the amount of integration between the cableless recording unit and other technologies used for survey design  equipment deployment retrieval  operational command and control  and data management 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies 
although our portfolio of patents is considered important to our operations and particular patents may be material to specific business lines  no one patent is considered essential to our consolidated business operations 
our patents  copyrights  and trademarks offer us only limited protection 
our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  or may design around the proprietary features of our products 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs 
our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
from time to time  third parties inquire and claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we make similar inquiries and claims to third parties 
no material liabilities have resulted from these third party claims to date

regulatory matters our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies  and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products or result in the need to modify products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
our export activities are also subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations 
certain countries are subject to trade restrictions  embargoes  and sanctions imposed by the us government 
these restrictions and sanctions prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries 
our operations are subject to numerous local  state  and federal laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials  the remediation of contaminated properties  and the protection of the environment 
we do not currently foresee the need for significant expenditures to ensure our continued compliance with current environmental protection laws 
regulations in this area are subject to change  and there can be no assurance that future laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our customers operations are also significantly impacted by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species 
for instance  many of our marine contractors have been affected by regulations protecting marine mammals in the gulf of mexico 
to the extent that our customers operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
employees as of december   we had  regular  full time employees  of which were located in the us from time to time and on an as needed basis  we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or as independent contractors in order to meet certain internal manufacturing or other business needs 
our us employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  we implemented a restructuring program that included reducing our headcount by approximately 
during  upon closing our joint venture transaction with bgp  we expect that a significant number of our land equipment systems employees will become employees within the joint venture  thereby further reducing our headcount 
we will continue to evaluate our staffing needs during and will make adjustments as necessary

item a 
risk factors this report contains or incorporates by reference statements concerning our future results and performance and other matters that are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended securities act  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended exchange act 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our or our industry s results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  would  should  intend  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology

these forward looking statements reflect our best judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us 
our results of operations can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we make or by risks and uncertainties known or unknown to us 
therefore  we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the forward looking statements 
actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations and assumptions 
while we cannot identify all of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from our expectations  we believe the following factors should be considered carefully we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness  and we will need to pay or refinance our existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness  which may adversely affect our operations 
any failure to complete our proposed transactions with bgp could result in an event of default under our credit obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  net of a million non cash debt discount associated with the million in convertible notes  and including capital lease obligations 
total indebtedness on that date included million in borrowings under five year term indebtedness and million  excluding the non cash debt discount  in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  in each case incurred under our amended commercial banking credit facility the amended credit facility 
it also included million of indebtedness outstanding under a term secured equipment financing loan and million of subordinated unsecured debt outstanding under an amended and restated subordinated promissory note the amended and restated subordinated note incurred in connection with the aram acquisition 
as of december  and february   we had available million without giving effect to million and million  respectively  of outstanding letters of credit of additional revolving credit borrowing capacity under our amended credit facility 
in january  standard and poor s rating services downgraded our outlook from stable to negative due to expectations of a weakening seismic market 
our substantial levels of indebtedness and our other financial obligations increase the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due  in respect of our outstanding indebtedness 
our substantial debt could also have other significant consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic  competitive and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes on satisfactory terms  or at all  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available to us for operations and any future business opportunities  expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings  including borrowings under our amended credit facility  are at variable rates of interest  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non strategic divestitures  limit our planning flexibility for  or ability to react to  changes in our business and the industries in which we operate  limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions  and place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors who may have less indebtedness or greater access to financing 
during  we had disclosed that under certain circumstances including lower than expected revenues from sales  we would not remain in compliance with certain of the financial covenants contained in our amended credit facility 
if we are not able to satisfy the covenants under the amended credit facility  we would need to seek to amend  or seek additional covenant waivers under the facility 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments  in which case we would likely seek to obtain new secured debt  unsecured debt or equity financing 
however  there also can be no assurance that such debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in october  we entered into bridge financing arrangements with bank of china  new york branch in connection with our proposed transactions with bgp  and obtained waivers of the financial covenants in the amended credit facility for the fiscal quarters ending september   december   march  and june  without these waivers  we would not have been in compliance with certain of our financial covenants at september  or december  however  our failure to comply with any of our other covenants under the amended credit facility could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and debt service capabilities 
we expect that upon the formation of the proposed land equipment joint venture with bgp and the closing and funding of the related transactions  we will repay our existing revolving credit loans and refinance our term loans under our amended credit facility and repay the amended and restated subordinated note indebtedness 
however  if our proposed joint venture and related transactions with bgp were not to be completed  even for reasons beyond our control such as us experiencing a material adverse event or condition that results in a material adverse effect on the our business  our prospects or results of operations  then the current waivers  upon notice from the lenders  would cease to be effective and we would at that time likely not be in compliance with certain of the financial covenants 
this could then result in an event of default 
as the current waivers cover a period of less than twelve months from december   we have classified the long term indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and term loan facility under our amended credit facility as current at december  as a result of the cross default provisions contained in our secured equipment financing instruments and our amended and restated subordinated note  we have also classified these long term obligations as current at december  defaults under these credit obligations and any resulting acceleration of indebtedness under their instruments would have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to make any required payments under our credit instruments  or if we fail to comply with any of the financial and operating covenants included in those instruments  we will be in default under their terms 
the lenders under such facilities could then accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and foreclose upon our and our subsidiaries assets that may secure such indebtedness 
other creditors might then accelerate other indebtedness under the cross default provisions in those agreements 
if our creditors accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our debt obligations 
even though we believe the joint venture with bgp will be completed as planned  there are certain events outside of our control that could cause the closing of the joint venture to be delayed  terminated or abandoned 
in such event  we would need to seek to amend  or seek additional covenant waivers under  the amended credit facility 
even though the lenders under the amended credit facility have demonstrated their willingness to work with us in amending or providing sufficient waivers to our facility  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments in the future 
if we were unable to obtain such waivers or amendments from the lenders  we would likely seek to replace or pay off the amended credit facility with new secured debt  unsecured debt or equity financing 
there is no guarantee that we will complete our proposed joint venture with bgp  and  if we do complete the joint venture  we may be subject to additional risks relating to our ability to perform our obligations under the joint venture  including funding future joint venture capital requirements 
in october  we announced that we had entered into a term sheet with bgp dated as of october  the term sheet to form a land equipment joint venture 
we also entered into bridge financing arrangements consisting of the following two promissory notes the convertible notes issued to bank of china under the amended credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of million  both convertible into shares of our common stock  and a warrant issuance agreement with bgp  under which we granted to bgp a warrant the warrant to purchase shares of our common stock that may be exercised in lieu of conversion of the convertible notes 
completion of the joint venture transactions contemplated in the term sheet is conditioned upon  among other things  approvals by chinese and us authorities and the lack of adverse regulatory actions that would materially prohibit  restrict or delay the completion of the joint venture transactions or the anticipated operations of the joint venture 
there can be no assurances that we will obtain necessary approvals or that we will complete the joint venture transactions as contemplated by the term sheet 
our inability to complete the joint venture transactions as contemplated may impact adversely our ability to execute our business strategy and  consequently  the marketability and market price of our common stock 
in addition  if we are not successful in completing the joint venture transactions as presently contemplated  we will likely have to modify our plans to refinance our senior secured indebtedness under our amended credit facility  which may entail additional time and costs  and may prove unsuccessful 
in addition  the limited waivers of our financial covenants contained in our amended credit facility may be terminated in such event  and we may at that time be in violation of the financial covenants and other covenants contained in our amended credit facility and the terms of other indebtedness that contain cross default provisions 
if the transactions contemplated by the term sheet are not completed  it could have a number of adverse consequences for our business  including the following we may lose the anticipated benefits of our proposed joint venture with bgp  which would include the potential savings from economies of scope and scale for our land seismic business and potential benefits from combined technological and new product development offerings  we may lose our ability to successfully refinance and restructure our senior secured indebtedness on terms favorable to our company  as contemplated by the term sheet  our business and operations may be harmed to the extent that customers  suppliers and other believe that our ability to successfully compete will be less effective without the joint venture or there is customer or employee uncertainty surrounding the future direction of our company  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected due to marketplace reaction  reduced sales levels and weakened financial condition caused by any of the factors mentioned above  and the exercise price under the warrant and the conversion prices under the convertible notes could be adjusted and reduced below their current amounts to considerably lower than current market price levels 
entering into joint ventures and alliances entails risks  including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of a newly formed joint venture  funding capital calls for the joint venture  exercising influence over the management and activities of joint venture  quality control concerns regarding joint venture products and services and potential conflicts of interest with the joint venture and our joint venture partner 
the completion of the joint venture is subject to  among other things  the completion of definitive documents governing the terms of the joint venture  and we cannot guarantee that  if completed  the joint venture operations will be successful 
any inability to meet our obligations as a joint venture partner under the joint venture could result in penalties and reduced percentage interest in the joint venture for our company 
also  we could be disadvantaged in the event of disputes and controversies with our joint venture partner  since our joint venture partner is a relatively significant customer of our products and services and future product and services of the joint venture 
to comply with our indebtedness and other obligations  we will require a significant amount of cash and will be required to satisfy certain debt financial covenants 
our ability to generate cash and satisfy debt covenants depends on many factors beyond our control 
our failure to complete the proposed joint venture and related transactions with bgp and refinance our existing bank indebtedness could result in an event of default under our credit facilities 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the amended credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we will need to repay or refinance our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  if for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service obligations  we would be in default under the terms of our agreements governing our outstanding debt 
if such a default were to occur  the lenders under the amended credit facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility immediately due and payable  and the lenders would not be obligated to continue to advance funds to us 
in addition  if such a default were to occur  our other indebtedness would become immediately due and payable under their cross default provisions 
the amended credit facility and other outstanding debt instruments to which we are a party impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking other actions 
subject to certain exceptions and qualifications  the amended credit facility contains customary restrictions on our activities  including covenants that restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock  creating liens on our assets  making certain investments or restricted payments  consolidating or merging with  or acquiring  another business  selling or otherwise disposing of our assets  paying dividends and making other distributions with respect to capital stock  or repurchasing  redeeming or retiring capital stock or subordinated debt  and entering into transactions with our affiliates 
the loan agreements for our million secured equipment financing with icon ion  llc contain a number of restrictive covenants that affect us  and our amended and restated subordinated note contains additional restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt 
any further debt financing we obtain is likely to have similarly restrictive covenants 
the amended credit facility also contains covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and minimum thresholds 
for example  the amended credit facility requires that we and our domestic subsidiaries meet certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements  not exceed certain maximum leverage ratio limitations for each fiscal quarter  and maintain certain minimum tangible net worth 
the lenders party to our amended credit facility agreed in an amendment to the credit agreement dated october  to waive these financial covenants for the fiscal quarters ending september   december   march  and june  without these waivers  we would not have been in compliance with certain of our financial covenants at september  or december  if we were not able to satisfy all of these covenants  we would need to seek to amend  or seek one or more waivers of  the covenants under the amended credit facility 
if we cannot satisfy the covenants and are unable to obtain further waivers or amendments  the lenders could declare a default under the amended credit facility 
any default under our amended credit facility would allow the lenders under the facility the option to demand repayment of the indebtedness outstanding under the facility  and would allow certain other lenders to exercise their rights and remedies under cross default provisions contained in their debt instruments 
if these lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the indebtedness outstanding  there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance or otherwise repay any amounts that may become accelerated under the agreements 
the acceleration of a significant portion of our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  and financial condition 
the restrictions in the amended credit facility and our other debt instruments may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business  and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted 
we also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility 
we cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the breach of any of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default under the amended credit facility and our other debt instruments 
an event of default under our debt agreements would permit the holders of such indebtedness to declare all amounts borrowed to be due and payable 
even though we believe the joint venture with bgp will be completed as planned  there are certain events outside of our control such as our experiencing a material adverse event or condition that results in a material adverse effect on our business  its prospects or results of operations that could cause the closing of the joint venture to be delayed  terminated or abandoned 
in such event  we would need to seek to amend  or seek additional covenant waivers under  the amended credit facility 
even though the lenders under the amended credit facility have demonstrated their willingness to work with us in amending or providing sufficient waivers to our facility  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments in the future 
if we were unable to obtain such waivers or amendments from the lenders  we would likely seek to replace or pay off the amended credit facility with new secured debt  unsecured debt or equity financing 
we are exposed to risks relating to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
following the end of our third quarter of  we discovered an error in revenue recognition of certain product revenues in connection with the delivery of a firefly land seismic data acquisition system and related hardware and components in china  which we had recorded in revenues for the second fiscal quarter of on november   we announced that we were restating our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six month periods ended june   as a result of this error in revenue recognition 
we had concluded that  as of june   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because this error in revenue recognition necessitating the restatement of our second quarter results of operations constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
this material weakness has been remediated as of december  a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of control deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
for a description of this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified in november and our remediation efforts as of december   see item a 
controls and procedures 
although we have remediated the above material weakness  there can be no assurance that such controls will effectively prevent material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
we may experience controls deficiencies or material weakness in the future  which could adversely impact the accuracy and timeliness of our future reporting and reports and filings we make with the sec 
if we  our option holders or others holding registration rights  sell additional shares of our common stock in the future  the market price of our common stock could decline 
additionally  our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock  the convertible notes issued under our amended credit facility and our warrant issued to bgp in connection with our proposed joint venture with bgp are convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
the conversion of the series d preferred stock or the convertible notes or the exercise of the warrant would result in dilution  and could result in substantial dilution  to existing stockholders 
sales in the open market of the shares of common stock acquired upon such conversion or exercise may have the effect of reducing the then current market prices for our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future  or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
as of february   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
substantially all of these shares are available for public sale  subject in some cases to volume and other limitations or delivery of a prospectus 
at december   we had outstanding stock options to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we also had  as of that date   shares of common stock reserved for issuance under outstanding restricted stock unit awards 
additionally  fletcher international  ltd  the holder of our series d cumulative convertible preferred stock  series d cumulative convertible preferred stock and series d cumulative convertible preferred stock together  the series d preferred stock currently has the right to convert the preferred shares it holds into  shares of our common stock 
under our agreement with fletcher  the holder of our series d preferred stock has the ability to sell the shares of our common stock under effective registration statements acquired by it upon conversion of the series d preferred stock 
in september  fletcher delivered a notice to us purporting to increase the number of shares of our common stock into which its preferred shares may convert from  shares to  shares  to become effective in november because we believe that our agreement with fletcher does not provide fletcher  as holder  the right to demand such additional increase  we have filed a declaratory judgment action in the court of chancery of the state of delaware asking the court to resolve the issue 
see item legal proceedings 
we currently have other pending litigation with fletcher in delaware regarding issues involving our series d preferred stock 
see item legal proceedings 
the  shares of common stock we issued in june to certain institutional investors may be resold into the public markets in transactions pursuant to a currently effective registration statement that was declared effective by the sec on june  thus  these purchasing institutional investors currently have the right to dispose of their shares in the public markets 
in october  we issued the convertible notes and the warrant in connection with our execution of the binding term sheet with bgp 
these instruments provide that they will be initially convertible into  or exercisable for  in the aggregate  up to  shares of common stock 
the exercise price under the warrant and conversion prices under the convertible notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
a triggering event will occur in the event that the joint venture transactions cannot be completed by march   solely as a result of the occurrence of a statement  order or other indication from any relevant governmental regulatory agency that a the transactions would not be approved  would be opposed  objected to or sanctioned or b the transactions or bgp s business and operations would be required to be altered or upon the earlier abandonment of such transactions due to any such statement  indication or order 
in such event  the exercise price and conversion price will be adjusted but not to an amount that exceeds per share to a price per share that is equal to of the lowest trading price of our common stock over a ten consecutive trading day period  beginning on and inclusive of the first trading day following the public announcement of any failure to complete such transactions or the abandonment thereof  which failure or abandonment was the result of the triggering event 
such an adjustment would further dilute holders of our common stock 
the conversion prices of the series d preferred stock  the exercise price of the warrant and conversion prices of the convertible notes are also subject to certain customary anti dilution adjustment 
any conversion of the convertible notes or exercise of the warrant will be conditioned upon certain governmental approvals from the chinese government 
at the closing of the transactions contemplated under the term sheet  it is expected that bgp along with any permitted assignees and designees will own  shares of common stock  whether through exercise of the warrant  conversions of the convertible notes or by direct purchase of shares of common stock from us 
under a registration rights agreement that we entered into with bgp on october   we agreed to register certain resales of shares of commons stock acquired by bgp or its assignees or designees under the convertible notes or the warrant 
the conversion of our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
likewise  the conversion of the convertible notes under our amended credit facility and exercise of our warrant issued to bgp in connection with our proposed joint venture with bgp will also dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion or exercise would likely apply downward pressure on prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the very existence of the outstanding shares of the series d preferred stock  the convertible notes and the warrant represents potential issuances of common stock upon their conversion or exercise  and could represent potential sales into the market of our common stock to be acquired on conversion or exercise  which could also depress trading prices for our common stock 
shares of our common stock are also subject to certain demand and piggyback registration rights held by laitram  llc we also may enter into additional registration rights agreements in the future in connection with any subsequent acquisitions or securities transactions we may undertake 
any sales of our common stock under these registration rights arrangements with laitram or other stockholders could be negatively perceived in the trading markets and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market under these arrangements  or the expectation of such sales  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the current economic and credit environment and lower oil and natural gas prices could continue to have an adverse effect on customer demand for certain of our products and services  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations  our cash flows  our financial condition  our ability to borrow and our stock price 
global market and economic conditions continue to be weak 
the global recession has caused weakened demand and lower prices for oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis  which have tended to reduce the levels of exploration for oil and natural gas 
historically  demand for our products and services has been sensitive to the level of exploration spending by e p companies and geophysical contractors 
the demand for our products and services will continue to be reduced if the level of exploration expenditures continues to be low 
during periods of reduced levels of exploration for oil and natural gas  there have been oversupplies of seismic data and downward pricing pressures on our seismic products and services  which in turn  have limited our ability to meet sales objectives and maintain profit margins for our products and services 
in the past  these then prevailing industry conditions have had the effect of reducing our revenues and operating margins 
the markets for oil and gas historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future 
the turmoil in the credit markets and its potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings under either existing or new debt facilities in the public or private markets and on terms we believe to be reasonable 
continued weakness in the financial markets could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness incurred in connection with the aram acquisition and to otherwise fund our operational requirements 
given the tight credit markets  there can be no assurance that our customers will be able to borrow money on a timely basis or on reasonable terms  which could have a negative impact on their demand for our products and impair their ability to pay us for our products and services on a timely basis  or at all 
our sales are affected by interest rate fluctuations and the availability of liquidity  and we would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or liquidity constraints 
rising interest rates may also make certain alternative products and services provided by our competitors more attractive to customers  which could lead to a decline in demand for our products and services 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will persist  whether they will deteriorate further  and which of our products and services will be adversely affected 
we may have further impairment losses if events or changes in circumstances occur which reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying amount 
as a result  these conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and we may be subject to increased disputes and litigation because of these events and issues 
stock markets  in general  have experienced over the past months  and may continue to experience  significant price and volume volatility  and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
this increased volatility  coupled with depressed economic conditions  could continue to have a depressing effect on the market price of our common stock 
if capital expenditures for e p companies remain at reduced levels compared to recent periods  the demand for our products and services may remain weak and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
demand for our products and services depends upon the level of spending by e p companies and seismic contractors for exploration and development activities  and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices 
spending on products and services such as those we provide our customers are of a highly discretionary nature and subject to rapid and material change 
any significant decline in oil and gas related spending on behalf of our customers could cause alterations in our capital spending plans  project modifications  delays or cancellations  general business disruptions or delays in payment  or non payment of amounts that are owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to continue to satisfy all of the covenants in our loan agreements 
additionally  increases in oil and gas prices may not increase demand for our services or otherwise have a positive effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
oil and gas companies willingness to explore  develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control  such as the supply of and demand for oil and gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and gas  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels for oil  the expected rates of declining current production  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  weather conditions  including hurricanes  that can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area  as well as less severe inclement weather that can preclude or delay seismic data acquisition  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil and gas producing countries  technical advances affecting energy consumption  government policies regarding the exploration  production and development of oil and gas reserves  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing  and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas companies and seismic contractors 
many of our products contain more advanced technologies than products our competition offer  and these products may tend to be  for that reason  more expensive than comparable products of our competitors 
the level of oil and gas exploration and production activity has been volatile in recent years 
previously forecasted trends in oil and gas exploration and development activities may not continue and demand for our products and services may not reflect the level of activity in the industry 
any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and gas prices would likely affect oil and gas production levels and therefore adversely affect demand for the products and services we provide 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from foreign operations and sales  which pose additional risks 
sales to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december   and we believe that export sales will remain a significant percentage of our revenue 
us export restrictions affect the types and specifications of products we can export 
additionally  to complete certain sales  us laws may require us to obtain export licenses  and we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty in obtaining these licenses 
like many energy service companies  we have operations in and sales into certain international areas  including parts of the middle east  west africa  latin america  asia pacific and the commonwealth of independent states  that are subject to risks of war  political disruption  civil disturbance  political corruption  possible economic and legal sanctions such as possible restrictions against countries that the us government may deem to sponsor terrorism and changes in global trade policies 
our sales or operations may become restricted or prohibited in any country in which the foregoing risks occur 
in particular  the occurrence of any of these risks could result in the following events  which in turn  could materially and adversely impact our results of operations disruption of oil and natural gas e p activities  restriction of the movement and exchange of funds  inhibition of our ability to collect receivables  enactment of additional or stricter us government or international sanctions  limitation of our access to markets for periods of time  expropriation and nationalization of our assets  political and economic instability  which may include armed conflict and civil disturbance  currency fluctuations  devaluations  and conversion restrictions  confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies  and governmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights 
our international operations and sales increase our exposure to other countries restrictive tariff regulations  other import export restrictions and customer credit risk 
in addition  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide 
our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities  and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes  penalties and or interest 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
each borrowing under our amended credit facility will bear interest  at our option  at either an alternate base rate or a libor based rate 
as of december   the million in term loan indebtedness and the million  excluding a non cash debt discount  in total revolving credit indebtedness under the amended credit facility accrued interest using the libor based interest rate of per annum 
the average effective interest rate for the quarter ended december  under the libor based rates was per annum 
assuming that million in revolving and term loans are outstanding  each basis point increase in the interest rate would have the effect of increasing the annual amount of interest to be paid by approximately million 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness of million was per annum 
our obligations to pay interest at relatively higher rates require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow for interest payments on our indebtedness and our other financial obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt 
alternative funding could result in higher interest rates 
however  there can be no assurance that alternative financial resources will be available promptly  on favorable terms or at all 
failure to obtain necessary funding could adversely affect our short term liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development to fund new product and service initiatives  upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities  and seek out potential acquisition candidates and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period  and we are subject to seasonality factors 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations from period to period as a result of new product or service introductions  the timing of significant expenses in connection with customer orders  unrealized sales  levels of research and development activities in different periods  the product mix sold  and the seasonality of our business 
because many of our products feature a high sales price and are technologically complex  we generally have experienced long sales cycles for these products and historically incur significant expense at the beginning of these cycles for component parts and other inventory necessary to manufacture a product in anticipation of a future sale  which may not ultimately occur 
in addition  the revenues from our sales can vary widely from period to period due to changes in customer requirements 
these factors can create fluctuations in our net revenues and results of operations from period to period 
variability in our overall gross margins for any period  which depend on the percentages of higher margin and lower margin products and services sold in that period  compounds these uncertainties 
as a result  if net revenues or gross margins fall below expectations  our results of operations and financial condition will likely be adversely affected 
additionally  our business can be seasonal in nature  with strongest demand typically in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
the fourth quarter of was not as strong as seen historically because the typical discretionary spending that normally occurs during the fourth quarter was not realized 
due to the relatively high sales price of many of our products and seismic data libraries and relatively low unit sales volume  our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated from period to period due to the timing of orders and shipments and the mix of products and services sold 
this uneven pattern makes financial predictions for any given period difficult  increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition  and places challenges on our inventory management 
delays caused by factors beyond our control  such as the granting of permits for seismic surveys by third parties and the availability and equipping of marine vessels  can affect our ion solutions division s revenues from its processing and iss services from period to period 
also  delays in ordering products or in shipping or delivering products in a given period could significantly affect our results of operations for that period 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause greater volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the technologies and businesses contributed by our company and bgp to the proposed joint venture may prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and divert management attention 
the proposed formation of a joint venture with bgp is consistent with our overall business strategy of seeking new technologies  products and businesses to broaden the scope of our existing and planned product lines and technologies 
the bgp joint venture involves the integration of multiple product lines and business models that previously have operated independently 
this will be a complex and time consuming process 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve the expected benefit of the proposed joint venture 
this joint venture if completed and future joint ventures or acquisitions that we complete may result in unexpected costs  expenses  and liabilities  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the bgp joint venture and future transactions may expose us to increased costs associated with the transaction and operation of the new business and new technologies and the management of geographically dispersed operations  risks associated with the assimilation of new technologies including incorporating bgp s land seismic equipment with our existing land seismic imaging product lines being contributed to the joint venture  operations  sites  and personnel  difficulties in retaining and integrating key technical  sales and marketing personnel and the possible loss of such employees and costs associated with their loss  difficulties associated with preserving relationships with our customers  partners and vendors  risks that any technology developed by the joint venture may not perform as well as we had anticipated  the diversion of management s attention and other resources from other business operations and related concerns  the potential inability to replicate operating efficiencies in the joint venture s operations  potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets  the inability to generate revenues to offset associated transaction costs  the requirement to maintain uniform standards  controls and procedures  and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration of management personnel from different companies 
integration of the contributed businesses requires significant efforts from us and bgp  including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts 
we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies  cost savings or other benefits that we expect from the joint venture 
the process of combining bgp s business with our business could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the operations and activities of the joint venture s business  as well as the possible loss of key personnel  and could distract our management s attention from the day to day operation of our company s remaining businesses 
intangible assets and goodwill that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions are subject to impairment evaluations and  as a result  we could be required to write off additional goodwill and intangible assets  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets asc  we are required to compare the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets when certain impairment indicators under asc are present to their carrying amount 
if the fair value of such goodwill or intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of these assets within the reporting units is less than their carrying value 
in the first quarter of  we determined that approximately million of intangible assets related to aram included in our land imaging systems reporting unit had been impaired 
we recorded the expense as of march  and reduced the carrying amount of our intangible assets 
any further reduction in or impairment of the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
at december  and  the goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the intangible asset balance was million and million  respectively 
due to the international scope of our business activities  our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from international sales  subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including the united kingdom  canada  the netherlands  china  venezuela  india  russia  the united arab emirates and other countries 
certain of these countries have experienced economic problems and uncertainties from time to time 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world  or the collectibility of receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently require customers in certain higher risk countries to provide their own financing 
in some cases  we have assisted our customers in organizing international financing and export import credit guarantees provided by the united states government 
we do not currently extend long term credit through notes to companies in countries we consider to be too risky from a credit risk perspective 
a majority of our foreign net working capital is within the united kingdom and canada 
the subsidiaries in those countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in pounds sterling gbp and canadian dollars cad  respectively 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in gbp or cad  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
for financial reporting purposes  such depreciation will negatively affect our reported results of operations since gbp and cad denominated earnings that are converted to us dollars are stated at a decreased value 
in addition  since we participate in competitive bids for sales of certain of our products and services that are denominated in us dollars  a depreciation of the us dollar against the gbp and cad harms our competitive position against companies whose financial strength bears less correlation to the strength of the us dollar 
while we have employed economic cash flow and fair value hedges designed to minimize the risks associated with these exchange rate fluctuations  the hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that fluctuations in the values of the currencies of countries in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations 
we are exposed to risks related to complex  highly technical products 
our customers often require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
because many of our products are complex and often use unique advanced components  processes  technologies  and techniques  undetected errors and design and manufacturing flaws may occur 
even though we attempt to assure that our systems are always reliable in the field  the many technical variables related to their operations can cause a combination of factors that can  and have from time to time  caused performance and service issues with certain of our products 
product defects result in higher product service  warranty  and replacement costs and may affect our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which may adversely impact our results of operations 
despite our testing and quality assurance programs  undetected errors may not be discovered until the product is purchased and used by a customer in a variety of field conditions 
if our customers deploy our new products and they do not work correctly  our relationship with our customers may be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our systems advanced and complex nature  we expect to experience occasional operational issues from time to time 
generally  until our products have been tested in the field under a wide variety of operational conditions  we cannot be certain that performance and service problems will not arise 
in that case  market acceptance of our new products could be delayed and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we rely on highly skilled personnel in our businesses  and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel  we may not be able to grow effectively 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate  and retain skilled personnel for all areas of our organization 
we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our businesses 
competition for qualified personnel required for our data processing operations and our other segments businesses has intensified in recent years 
our growth has presented challenges to us to recruit  train  and retain our employees while managing the impact of potential wage inflation and the lack of available qualified labor in some markets where we operate 
a well trained  motivated and adequately staffed work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business 
our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees 
if we do not effectively manage our transitions into new products and services  our revenues may suffer 
products and services for the seismic industry are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance  software functionality and features  frequent introduction of new products and services  and improvement in price characteristics relative to product and service performance 
among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing  variations in costs  delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions  write offs or write downs of the carrying costs of inventory and raw materials associated with prior generation products  difficulty in predicting customer demand for new product and service offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand  risks associated with customer qualification  evaluation of new products  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software 
the introduction of new products and services by our competitors also may result in delays in customer purchases and difficulty in predicting customer demand 
if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings  our revenues and margins may decline 
furthermore  sales of our new products and services may replace sales  or result in discounting of some of our current offerings  offsetting the benefit of a successful introduction 
in addition  it may be difficult to ensure performance of new products and services in accordance with our revenue  margin  and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates 
given the competitive nature of the seismic industry  if any of these risks materializes  future demand for our products and services  and our future results of operations  may suffer 
technological change in the seismic industry requires us to make substantial research and development expenditures 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by changing technology and new product introductions 
we must invest substantial capital to develop and maintain a leading edge in technology  with no assurance that we will receive an adequate rate of return on those investments 
if we are unable to develop and produce successfully and timely new and enhanced products and services  we will be unable to compete in the future and our business  our results of operations and our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we invest significant sums of money in acquiring and processing seismic data for our ion solutions multi client data library 
we invest significant amounts in acquiring and processing new seismic data to add to our ion solutions multi client data library 
a majority of these investments is funded by our customers  while the remainder is recovered through future data licensing fees 
in  we invested million in our multi client data library 
our customers generally commit to licensing the data prior to our initiating a new data library acquisition program 
however  the aggregate amounts of future licensing fees for this data are sometimes uncertain and depend on a variety of factors  including the market prices of oil and gas  customer demand for seismic data in the library  and the availability of similar data from competitors 
for example  the rapid decline of oil and natural gas prices in late have and could continue to cause e p companies to significantly delay or reduce their current seismic capital spending budgets 
therefore  we may not be able to recover all of the costs of or earn any return on these investments 
in periods in which sales do not meet original expectations  we may be required to record additional amortization and or impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our data library  which charges may be material to our results of operations in any period 
the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have traditionally relied on a relatively small number of significant customers 
consequently  our business is exposed to the risks related to customer concentration 
no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  however  our top five customers in total represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net revenues during those years 
the loss of any of our significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  a relatively small number of customers has accounted for the majority of our net revenues in any period 
during the last ten years  our traditional seismic contractor customers have been rapidly consolidating  thereby consolidating the demand for our products 
the loss of any of our significant customers to further consolidation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our ion solutions and data management solutions segments increase our exposure to the risks experienced by more technology intensive companies 
the businesses of ion solutions and data management solutions  being more concentrated in software  processing services  and proprietary technologies than our traditional business  have exposed us to the risks typically encountered by smaller technology companies that are more dependent on proprietary technology protection 
these risks include future competition from more established companies entering the market  product obsolescence  dependence upon continued growth of the market for seismic data processing  the rate of change in the markets for these segments technology and services  research and development efforts not proving sufficient to keep up with changing market demands  dependence on third party software for inclusion in these segments products and services  misappropriation of these segments technology by other companies  alleged or actual infringement of intellectual property rights that could result in substantial additional costs  difficulties inherent in forecasting sales for newly developed technologies or advancements in technologies  recruiting  training  and retaining technically skilled personnel that could increase the costs for these segments  or limit their growth  and the ability to maintain traditional margins for certain of their technology or services 
the contribution of our land equipment businesses to the joint venture exposes our company to additional risks 
please refer to the additional risks below 
reservoir exploration technology rxt has been a significant customer of our marine imaging systems segment 
a loss of business from this customer could adversely affect our sales and financial condition if rxt is not replaced by another customer or customers 
in may  we entered into a multi year agreement with rxt under which they agreed to purchase a minimum of million in vectorseis ocean vso systems and related equipment through in addition  this agreement entitles us to receive a royalty of of revenues generated by rxt through the use of all vso equipment commencing in january until the expiration of the agreement 
in turn  rxt was granted exclusive rights to this product line through because they did not purchase the minimum annual quantity of equipment  in february  we notified rxt that they no longer have exclusive rights to the vso product line 
for the years ended december  and  million  or  and million  or  respectively  of our consolidated net revenues  were attributable to marine equipment sales to and royalty revenues from rxt 
the loss of rxt as a customer or a continued significant reduction in their equipment or systems needs could reduce our sales volumes and revenues and lessen our cash flows  and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
unless we can broaden our customer base for these marine products  we can give no assurances that the revenues and cash flows from rxt  if lost  can be replaced 
to the extent that the risks faced by rxt cause it to curtail its business activities or to make timely payments to its suppliers  we are subject to the same risks 
we are subject to intense competition  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or to maintain our prices at profitable levels 
many of our sales are obtained through a competitive bidding process  which is standard for our industry 
competitive factors in recent years have included price  technological expertise  and a reputation for quality  safety and dependability 
while no single company competes with us in all of our segments  we are subject to intense competition in each of our segments 
new entrants in many of the markets in which certain of our products and services are currently strong should be expected 
see item business competition 
we compete with companies that are larger than we are in terms of revenues  number of processing locations and sales and marketing resources 
a few of our competitors have a competitive advantage in being part of an affiliated seismic contractor company 
in addition  we compete with major service providers and government sponsored enterprises and affiliates 
some of our competitors conduct seismic data acquisition operations as part of their regular business  which we do not  and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
these and other competitors may be better positioned to withstand and adjust more quickly to volatile market conditions  such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices  as well as changes in government regulations 
in addition  any excess supply of products and services in the seismic services market could apply downward pressure on prices for our products and services 
the negative effects of the competitive environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
certain of our facilities could be damaged by hurricanes and other natural disasters  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our facilities are located in regions of the united states that are susceptible to damage from hurricanes and other weather events  and  during  were impacted by hurricanes or weather events 
our marine imaging systems segment leases  square feet of facilities located in harahan  louisiana  in the greater new orleans metropolitan area 
in late august  we suspended operations at this facility and evacuated and locked down the facility in preparation for hurricane katrina 
this facility did not experience flooding or significant damage during or after the hurricane 
however  because of employee evacuations  power failures and lack of related support services  utilities and infrastructure in the new orleans area  we were unable to resume full operations at the facility until late september in september  we lost power and related services for several days at our offices located in the houston metropolitan area and in harahan  louisiana as a result of hurricane ike and hurricane gustav 
future hurricanes or similar natural disasters that impact our facilities may negatively affect our financial position and operating results for those periods 
these negative effects may include reduced production and product sales  costs associated with resuming production  reduced orders for our products from customers that were similarly affected by these events  lost market share  late deliveries  additional costs to purchase materials and supplies from outside suppliers  uninsured property losses  inadequate business interruption insurance and an inability to retain necessary staff 
we have outsourcing arrangements with third parties to manufacture some of our products 
if these third party suppliers fail to deliver quality products or components at reasonable prices on a timely basis  we may alienate some of our customers and our revenues  profitability  and cash flow may decline 
additionally  the current global economic crisis could have a negative impact on our suppliers  causing a disruption in our vendor supplies 
a disruption in vendor supplies may adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing processes require a high volume of quality components 
we have increased our use of contract manufacturers as an alternative to our own manufacturing of products 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of our vibrator vehicles  our towed marine streamers  our redeployable ocean bottom cables  our applied mems components  various components of vectorseis ocean  and certain electronic and ground components of our land acquisition systems 
certain components used by us are currently provided by only one supplier 
if  in implementing any outsource initiative  we are unable to identify contract manufacturers willing to contract with us on competitive terms and to devote adequate resources to fulfill their obligations to us or if we do not properly manage these relationships  our existing customer relationships may suffer 
in addition  by undertaking these activities  we run the risk that the reputation and competitiveness of our products and services may deteriorate as a result of the reduction of our control over quality and delivery schedules 
we also may experience supply interruptions  cost escalations  and competitive disadvantages if our contract manufacturers fail to develop  implement  or maintain manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and customers 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key components  increases in component costs and reduced control over delivery schedules 
if any of these risks are realized  our revenues  profitability  and cash flows may decline 
in addition  as we come to rely more heavily on contract manufacturers  we may have fewer personnel resources with expertise to manage problems that may arise from these third party arrangements 
additionally  our suppliers could be negatively impacted by current global economic conditions 
if certain of our suppliers were to experience significant cash flow issues or become insolvent as a result of such conditions  it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies to us or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 
our outsourcing relationships may require us to purchase inventory when demand for products produced by third party manufacturers is low 
under some of our outsourcing arrangements  our manufacturing outsourcers purchase agreed upon inventory levels to meet our forecasted demand 
our manufacturing plans and inventory levels are generally based on sales forecasts 
if demand proves to be less than we originally forecasted and we cancel our committed purchase orders  our outsourcers generally will have the right to require us to purchase inventory which they had purchased on our behalf 
should we be required to purchase inventory under these terms  we may be required to hold inventory that we may never utilize 
we currently have no purchase commitments with colibrys for additional mems 
we may be unable to obtain broad intellectual property protection for our current and future products and we may become involved in intellectual property disputes 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies 
we believe that the technological and creative skill of our employees  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition  and reliable product maintenance are the foundations of our competitive advantage 
although we have a considerable portfolio of patents  copyrights  and trademarks  these property rights offer us only limited protection 
our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  or may design around the proprietary features of our products 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs 
our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
third parties inquire and claim from time to time that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  result in injunctions  require product modifications  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such claims could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
much of our litigation in recent years have involved disputes over our and others rights to technology 
see item legal proceedings 
our operations  and the operations of our customers  are subject to numerous government regulations  which could adversely limit our operating flexibility 
our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies  and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products or result in the need to modify products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
our export activities are also subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations 
certain countries are subject to restrictions  sanctions  and embargoes imposed by the united states government 
these restrictions  sanctions  and embargoes also prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries 
our operations are subject to numerous local  state  and federal laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials  the remediation of contaminated properties  and the protection of the environment 
these laws have been changed frequently in the past  and there can be no assurance that future changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our customers operations are also significantly impacted by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species 
consequently  changes in governmental regulations applicable to our customers may reduce demand for our products 
for instance  regulations regarding the protection of marine mammals in the gulf of mexico may reduce demand for our air guns and other marine products 
to the extent that our customers operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  delaware law  our stockholders rights plan  the terms of our series d preferred stock and contractual requirements under our agreement with fletcher contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  delaware law  our stockholders rights plan  the terms of our series d preferred stock and our agreement with fletcher may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for shares of our common stock

item legal proceedings westerngeco 
on june   westerngeco llc westerngeco filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the southern district of texas  houston division 
in the lawsuit  styled westerngeco llc v 
ion geophysical corporation  westerngeco alleges that we have infringed several united states patents regarding marine seismic streamer steering devices that are owned by westerngeco 
westerngeco is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an injunction prohibiting us from making  using  selling  offering for sale or supplying any infringing products in the united states 
based on our review of the lawsuit filed by westerngeco and the westerngeco patents at issue  we believe that our products do not infringe any westerngeco patents  that the claims asserted by westerngeco are without merit and that the ultimate outcome of the claims will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we intend to defend the claims against us vigorously 
on june   we filed an answer and counterclaims against westerngeco  in which we deny that we have infringed westerngeco s patents and assert that the westerngeco patents are invalid or unenforceable 
we also asserted that westerngeco s q marine system  components and technology infringe upon our united states patent related to marine seismic streamer steering devices 
we also asserted that westerngeco misappropriated our proprietary technology and breached a confidentiality agreement by using our technology in its patents and products and that westerngeco tortiously interfered with our relationship with our customers 
in addition  we are claiming that the lawsuit by westerngeco is an illegal attempt by westerngeco to control and restrict competition in the market for marine seismic surveys performed using laterally steerable streamers 
we are requesting various remedies and relief  including a declaration that the westerngeco patents are invalid or unenforceable  an injunction prohibiting westerngeco from making  using  selling  offering for sale or supplying any infringing products in the united states  a declaration that the westerngeco patents should be co owned by us  and an award of unspecified monetary damages 
fletcher 
during  three lawsuits were filed in delaware involving fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher  the holder of shares of our series d preferred stock 
on july   fletcher filed a books and records proceeding in the delaware court of chancery under section b of the delaware general corporation law  styled fletcher international  ltd 
v 
ion geophysical corporation f k a input output  inc fletcher s complaint asked the court to require us to produce for its inspection a broad range of our documents and records relating to our aram acquisition and other matters 
section b allows stockholders of delaware corporations to make a demand on the corporation for access to certain books and records of the corporation  provided that such demand is made with appropriate specificity and is made for a proper purpose 
we responded by asserting that fletcher had not requested the information with appropriate specificity or for a proper purpose as required by law 
after a hearing on december   the court determined that most of fletcher s stated purposes for requesting the information were not valid or did not constitute proper purposes and issued a ruling denying in significant part the scope and breadth of the inspection sought by fletcher 
under our february agreement with fletcher  the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued or issuable to fletcher upon conversion of the series d preferred stock could not exceed a designated maximum number of shares the maximum number  and such maximum number could be increased by fletcher providing us with a day notice of increase 
in november  fletcher exercised its right to increase the maximum number from  shares to  shares 
on september   fletcher delivered a second notice to us that purported to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series d preferred stock from  shares to  shares 
our interpretation of the agreement with fletcher gave fletcher the right to issue only one notice to increase the maximum number which fletcher had exercised on november  
on november   we filed an action in the court of chancery of the state of delaware  styled ion geophysical corporation v 
fletcher international  ltd  seeking a declaration that  under the agreement  fletcher is permitted to deliver only one notice to increase the maximum number and that its purported second notice is legally invalid

our current business strategy is predicated on successfully executing seven key imperatives increasing our market share and profitability in land acquisition systems and furthering the commercialization of firefly  our cableless full wave land data acquisition system  and our other land equipment technologies through our participation in the proposed land equipment joint venture with bgp  continuing to manage our cost structure to reflect current market and economic conditions while keeping key strategic technology programs progressing with an overall goal of enabling e p companies to solve their complex reservoir problems most efficiently and effectively  expanding our ion solutions business in new regions with new customers and new land and marine service offerings  including proprietary services for owners and operators of oil and gas properties  globalizing our ion solutions data processing business by opening advanced imaging centers in new strategic locations  and expanding our presence in the land seismic processing segment  with emphasis on serving the national oil companies  developing and introducing our next generation of marine towed streamer products  with a goal of developing markets beyond the new vessel market  expanding our seabed imaging solutions business using our vectorseis ocean vso acquisition system platform and derivative products to obtain technical and market leadership in what we continue to believe is a very important and expanding market  and leveraging our proposed land equipment joint venture with bgp to design and deliver lower cost  more reliable land imaging systems to our worldwide customer base of land acquisition contractors  while concurrently tapping into a broader set of global geophysical opportunities associated with the exploration  asset development  and production operations of bgp s parent  cnpc 
our current debt levels 
in connection with our acquisition in september of aram  we increased our total indebtedness significantly 
as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  net of a million non cash debt discount associated with million in convertible notes  and including capital lease obligations 
total indebtedness on that date included million of outstanding five year term indebtedness and million  excluding the non cash debt discount  in outstanding revolving credit debt  in each case incurred under our amended commercial banking credit facility the amended credit facility 
total indebtedness on that date also included million in borrowings under our secured equipment financing transaction with icon described below and million of subordinated indebtedness outstanding under an amended and restated subordinated promissory note the amended and restated subordinated note that we had issued to one of aram s selling shareholders as part of the purchase price consideration for the aram acquisition 
on june   we completed a private placement transaction under which we issued and sold  shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions  for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the million of net proceeds from the offering  along with million of cash on hand  were applied to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness under a bridge loan agreement with jefferies finance llc 
the indebtedness under the bridge loan agreement had been scheduled to mature on january  and had an effective interest rate at the time of repayment of 
we also entered into an additional amendment to the amended credit facility the fifth amendment  which among other things  modified certain of the financial and other covenants contained in the amended credit facility 
see further discussion below at liquidity and capital resources sources of capital and at note notes payable  long term debt and lease obligations 
on june   we entered into a million secured equipment financing with icon ion  llc  an affiliate of icon capital inc icon  receiving million in funding on that date and million in july all borrowed indebtedness under the master loan agreements governing this equipment financing arrangement is scheduled to mature on july  we used the proceeds of the secured term loans for working capital and general corporate purposes 
see further discussion below at liquidity and capital resources sources of capital and at note notes payable  long term debt and lease obligations 
proposed joint venture with bgp 
on october   we entered into a binding term sheet the term sheet with bgp inc  china national petroleum corporation  a company organized under the laws of the people s republic of china bgp  which sets forth  among other things  the principal terms for a proposed land equipment joint venture between bgp and us 
in connection with the execution of the term sheet  we entered into an amendment to the amended credit facility the sixth amendment that  among other things  i increased the aggregate revolving commitment amount under the amended credit facility from million to million  ii permitted bank of china  new york branch bank of china  to join the amended credit facility as a lender  and iii modified  or provided limited waivers of  certain of the financial and other covenants contained in the amended credit facility 
our bridge financing arrangement consisted of the following two promissory notes the convertible notes issued to the bank of china under the amended credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of million  both convertible into shares of our common stock  and a warrant issuance agreement with bgp  under which we granted to bgp a warrant the warrant to purchase shares of our common stock that may be exercised in lieu of conversion of the convertible notes 
see further discussion below at proposed joint venture and related transactions with bgp 
waivers under amended credit facility 
as a result of our october bridge financing arrangements with bank of china  we believe that our liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as the transactions with bgp are completed or alternative financing could be obtained 
additionally  as a result of our entering into the sixth amendment  we believe that the waivers of the financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility for the fiscal quarters ending september   december   march  and june  should enable us to conduct our operations without defaulting under our amended credit facility until the transactions under the term sheet are completed 
we currently expect these transactions will be completed in march without these waivers  we would not have been in compliance with certain of our financial covenants at september  or december  if the proposed transactions under the term sheet are not completed by march   then the current waivers  upon notice from the lenders after a designated period of time  would cease to be effective and we at that time would likely not be in compliance with certain of the financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility  which could then result in an event of default 
as the current waivers cover a period of less than twelve months from december   we have classified our long term indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and term loan facility under the amended credit facility as current at december  as a result of the cross default provisions in our secured equipment financing and our amended and restated subordinated seller note  we have also classified these long term obligations as current at december  even though we believe the joint venture with bgp will be completed as planned  there are certain events outside of the our control such as us experiencing a material adverse event or condition that results in a material adverse effect on our business  our prospects or results of operations that could cause the closing of the joint venture to be delayed  terminated or abandoned 
in such event  we would need to seek to amend  or seek additional covenant waivers under  the amended credit facility 
even though the lenders under the amended credit facility have demonstrated their willingness to work with us in amending or providing sufficient waivers to its facility  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments in the future 
if we were to be unable to obtain such waivers or amendments from the lenders  we would likely seek to replace or pay off the amended credit facility with new secured debt  unsecured debt or equity financing 
as part of the formation of the joint venture  we have been in discussions with various financial institutions both domestic and international on the refinancing of our debt 
as a result of these discussions and with the recent improvements within the financial markets  we believe that in the unlikely event the joint venture is not completed as planned  we would be able to obtain additional debt or equity financings prior to defaulting on our current debt obligations 
however  there also can be no assurance that such debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
economic conditions and cost containments 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness and ability to expend their capital for oil and natural gas exploration and development projects 
this demand is highly sensitive to current and expected future oil and natural gas prices 
the volatility of oil and natural gas prices in recent years has resulted in sharply curtailed demand for oil and gas exploration activities in north america and other regions 
the uncertainty surrounding future economic activity levels and the tightening of credit availability resulted in decreased sales levels for several of our businesses in our land seismic equipment businesses in north america and russia have been particularly adversely affected 
our seismic contractor customers and the e p companies that are users of our products  services and technology have generally reduced their capital spending levels since we also expect that exploration and production expenditures will remain at restrained levels to the extent e p companies and seismic contractors are limited in their access to the credit markets as a result of further disruptions in  or continued conservative lending practices in  the credit markets 
there continues to be significant uncertainty about future activity levels and the impact on our businesses 
in particular  our north america and russia land systems business and our vibroseis truck business experienced steep sales declines in  and uncertain prospects for in response to the global economic downturn  we took measures to reduce operating costs in our businesses during and in addition  we slowed our capital spending  including our investments in our multi client data libraries in for the year ended december   total capital expenditures were million  compared to million for the year ended december  we are projecting capital expenditures for to be between million to million 
of that total  we expect to spend approximately million to million on investments in our multi client data library  and we anticipate that a majority of this investment will be underwritten by our customers 
to the extent that our customers commitments do not reach an acceptable level of pre funding  the amount of our anticipated investment could in likely respect decline 
the remaining sums are expected to be funded from internally generated cash 
we are continuing to explore ways to reduce our cost structure 
we have taken a deliberate approach to analyzing product and service demands in our business and are taking a more conservative approach in offering extended financing terms to our customers 
our most significant cost reduction to date has related to reduced headcount 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  we reduced our headcount by positions  or approximately of our employee headcount  in order to adjust to the lower levels of activity 
including all contractors and employees  we reduced our headcount by positions  or 
in april  we also initiated a salary reduction program that reduced employee salaries 
the salary reductions reduced affected employees annual base salaries by for our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and chief financial officer  for all other executives and senior management  and for most other employees 
our board also elected to implement a reduction in director fees 
in addition to the salary reduction program  we suspended our matching contributions to employee k plan contributions 
we reinstated all employees salaries and director fees at their previous levels following the october  announcement of our company and bgp entering into a binding term sheet providing for  among other things  the formation of a joint venture between our company and bgp involving our land based seismic data acquisition equipment business see proposed joint venture and related transactions with bgp below 
we will continue to fund strategic programs to position us for the expected recovery in economic activity 
overall  we will give priority to generating cash flows and reducing our cost structure  while maintaining our long term commitment to continued technology development 
our business is mainly technology based 
we are not in the field crew business  and therefore do not have large amounts of capital and other resources invested in vessels or other assets necessary to support contracted seismic data acquisition services  nor do we have large manufacturing facilities 
this cost structure gives us the flexibility to adjust our expense base when downward economic cycles affect our industry 
while the current global recession and the decline in oil and gas prices have slowed demand for our products and services in the near term  we believe that our industry s long term prospects remain favorable because of the declining rates in oil and gas production and the relatively small number of new discoveries of oil and gas reserves 
we believe that technology that adds a competitive advantage through cost reductions or improvements in productivity will continue to be valued in our marketplace  even in the current difficult market 
for example  we believe that our new technologies  such as firefly  digifin and orca  will continue to attract interest from our customers because those technologies are designed to deliver improvements in image quality within more productive delivery systems 
we have adjusted much of our sales efforts for our aries land seismic systems from north america to international sales channels other than russia 
international oil companies iocs continue to have difficulty accessing new sources of supply for their exploration activities  partially as a result of the growth of national oil companies 
this situation is also affected by increasing environmental concerns  particularly in north america  where companies may be denied access to some of the most promising onshore and offshore exploration opportunities 
it is estimated that approximately of the world s reserves are controlled by national oil companies  which increasingly prefer to develop resources on their own or by working directly with the oil field services and equipment providers 
these dynamics often prevent capital  technology and project management capabilities from being optimally deployed on the best exploration and production opportunities  which results in global supply capacity being less than it otherwise might be 
as a consequence  the pace of new supply additions may be insufficient to keep up with demand once the global recession ends 
developments 
our overall total net revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  compared to total net revenues for the year ended december  at the same time  our overall gross profit percentage improved for the year ended to compared to for the year ended for the year ended december   we recorded a loss from operations of million which includes the effect of an impairment of intangible assets charge of million taken in the first quarter of  compared to million which includes the effect of impairments of goodwill and intangible asset charges of million taken in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december  developments during and early include the following in january  we announced our first delivery of a multi thousand station version firefly system equipped with digital  full wave vectorseis sensors to the world s largest land contractor 
the deployment in the second quarter of we recognized the revenue from this sale in the fourth quarter of of this firefly system occurred in a producing hydrocarbon basin containing reservoirs that have proven difficult to image with conventional seismic techniques 
in march  we announced that we had signed an agreement with the polarcus group of companies for the provision of seismic data processing services 
under the agreement  we will provide hardware  software and geophysicists in order to support a seismic project s entire imaging lifecycle  from the vessel to an onshore data processing center 
in april  we announced that a  station firefly system will be utilized by a major oil company to undertake two high channel count  multicomponent full wave seismic acquisition programs in northeast texas  and  in july  we announced that our client had sanctioned the second phase of the program 
in april  we announced the first commercial sale of our cable based aries ii seismic recording platform to one of the world s largest geophysical services providers 
the sale includes two  channel aries ii recording systems that the customer plans to deploy on upcoming  high channel count seismic surveys 
in may  we announced that an  station firefly system will be utilized by compania mexicana de exploraciones comesa  an oilfield services company majority owned by pemex  the national oil company of mexico  on three projects in mexico 
in may  we announced that we had successfully acquired an additional  kilometers of regional seismic data offshore india s western coast as part of our ongoing indiaspan program 
another  kilometers has since been acquired off the east coast of india 
in july  we announced that we had successfully completed the data processing and interpretation for argentinespan  a basin scale seismic program offshore argentina 
argentinespan contains approximately  kilometers of new  regional data 
in july  we announced that we had successfully acquired  kilometers of regional seismic data covering the bight basin and ceduna sub basin offshore southern australia 
known as bightspan  this latest addition to our global basinspan seismic data library offers the first regional geologic study of australia s deepwater southern coast 
in october  we announced our proposed joint venture with bgp and the related bridge financing transactions 
see proposed joint venture and related transactions with bgp 
in january  we announced that we had extended our brasilspan program  which makes it one of the largest d seismic datasets in our multi client data library 
the program currently contains  km of data off the coast of south america 
proposed joint venture and related transactions with bgp on october   we entered into a binding term sheet with bgp  which provides for  among other things  the formation of a joint venture between our company and bgp involving our land based seismic data acquisition equipment business 
the term sheet contemplates that we will enter into a purchase agreement with bgp to form the joint venture 
we expect to form the joint venture entity as a wholly owned subsidiary of ion geophysical corporation and will contribute to the joint venture certain assets and related liabilities that relate to the proposed joint venture business 
then  bgp will acquire from us a equity interest in the joint venture for an aggregate purchase price of million cash and will contribute to the joint venture certain of its assets and related liabilities that relate to the joint venture s business 
the assets of each party to be contributed to the joint venture will include seismic recording systems  inventory  certain intellectual property rights and contract rights  all as may be necessary to or principally used in the conduct or operation of the businesses to be contributed to the joint venture as presently conducted or operated by each party 
the scope of the joint venture s business is defined in the term sheet as being the business of designing  development  engineering  manufacturing  research and development  distribution  sales and marketing and field support of land based equipment used in seismic data acquisition for the petroleum industry 
excluded from the scope of the joint venture s business will be x the analog sensor businesses of our company and bgp and y the businesses of certain companies in which bgp or we are currently a minority owner 
in addition to these excluded businesses  all of our other businesses including our marine imaging systems  data management solutions and ion solutions  which includes gxt s imaging solutions  integrated seismic solutions iss and basinspan and seismic data libraries will remain owned and operated by us and will not comprise a part of the joint venture 
under the term sheet  the parties have agreed to use their best efforts to cause the closing of the joint venture and related transactions to occur as soon as practicable following the execution of the definitive transaction documents  and on or before the later to occur of the following dates i december  or ii business days following the date on which all necessary regulatory approvals including receiving clearance from the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius to complete the transactions have been obtained  but in any event  no later than march  the parties obligations under the term sheet may be terminated a by written agreement of the parties  b by either party in the even that such party s conditions have not been satisfied on or before march  subject to a day cure period or c by either party in the event that certain mutual conditions have not been satisfied on or before march  in addition  bgp and we have each agreed to pay the other a break up fee of million if either party determines to terminate its obligations under the term sheet because the other party has failed to satisfy certain conditions  including conditions precedent to closing that x the other party has not experienced a material adverse event or condition that has resulted in a material adverse effect on its business  prospects and results of operations change  y the other party has not breached any of its representations and warranties contained in the term sheet and such representations and warranties continue to be true and correct and z with respect to bgp s obligations under the term sheet  we have not suffered any material default or accelerations of any of our liabilities 
on october   we borrowed an aggregate of million in the form of revolving credit bridge loan financing from bank of china  which was evidenced by the convertible notes 
this borrowing was pursuant to and permitted by the terms of the sixth amendment to the credit facility  which increased the aggregate revolving commitment amount under the accordion feature provisions of the amended credit facility from million to million and permitted the bank of china to join the amended credit facility as a lender 
the convertible notes provide that at the stated initial conversion price of per share  the full million principal amount under the convertible notes would be convertible into  shares of common stock 
the convertible notes provide that the conversion price and the number of shares into which the notes may be converted are subject to adjustment under certain terms and conditions similar to those contained in the warrant 
as part of bgp arranging for the bank of china to join our amended credit facility  we granted to bgp the warrant 
the warrant will be exercisable  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  subject to the conditions described below 
the warrant will initially entitle the holder thereof to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to million divided by the exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment as described below 
at the initial exercise price of per share  at such time as the warrant becomes exercisable  it would initially be fully exercisable for  shares of common stock 
the warrant will only become exercisable and the convertible notes will only become convertible upon receipt of certain governmental approvals 
any conversions of the convertible notes and prior exercises of the warrant will reduce the dollar amount under the warrant into which the exercise price may be divided to determine the number of shares that may be acquired upon exercise 
additionally  the term sheet provides that when the joint venture transactions are closed bgp will have purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million and thereby own  before giving effect to the issuance of those shares  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
to the extent that shares are not purchased by bgp under the warrant prior to closing  the new revolving credit loans from bank of china  evidenced by the convertible notes will convert into approximately million shares of ion common stock and will be credited against the approximately million shares of ion stock to be purchased by bgp at the transaction closing 
ion will appoint a designee of bgp to its board of directors to serve with the current nine members of ion s board of directors 
bgp will arrange for our then outstanding long term debt under the amended credit facility currently million outstanding at february  to be refinanced at the joint venture closing 
we will use a portion of the proceeds from the transactions to pay off and retire our outstanding indebtedness under our current revolving credit facility after giving effect to the million in additional revolving credit borrowings under our existing amended credit facility  approximately million is currently outstanding at february  and million in seller subordinated indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisition of aram in september we will receive a new million revolving credit facility at the joint venture closing 
the million as of december  secured equipment financing transaction with icon will be assigned to and become indebtedness of the joint venture 
the proposed joint venture is intended to provide a number of benefits and opportunities  including the following preferred access to bgp  currently the world s largest land seismic contractor  anticipated improved economies of scope and scale in our land data acquisition system manufacturing and sales operations  enabling us to deliver products in a more timely manner at an overall lower cost to its customers  combining our strengths in land equipment technologies with bgp s emerging geophysical product portfolio and expertise in operating land seismic acquisition crews  which should permit new joint venture products to be designed and field tested for reliability  quality and productivity to the benefit of all customers  and aligning the joint venture engineering teams to develop innovative  market leading land recording systems  c full wave sensor and vibroseis products 
we believe that the joint venture will enable us to continue developing land systems and sensor technologies with lessened primary capital requirements through our partnership with bgp 
key financial metrics 
the following table provides an overview of key financial metrics for our company as a whole and our four business segments during the twelve months ended december   compared to those for fiscal and in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december  net revenues ion systems division land imaging systems marine imaging systems data management solutions total ion systems division ion solutions division total income loss from operations ion systems division land imaging systems marine imaging systems data management solutions total ion systems division ion solutions division corporate years ended december  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets total net income loss applicable to common shares basic net income loss per common share diluted net income per loss common share we intend that the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows will provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
we anticipate that we will account for our interest in the proposed joint venture with bgp under the equity method of accounting under us generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  after the joint venture is formed  we will no longer include in our results of operations all of the net revenues and costs and expenses attributable to the contributed businesses on a going forward basis 
in our results of operations  our proportional share of the joint venture s net income loss will be reported as a single line item  and our investment in the joint venture will be increased by our proportional share of joint venture net income and decreased by our proportional payment of dividends made 
additionally  our equity investment in the joint venture will be reported as a single line item on our balance sheet  and the assets and liabilities of the contributed business currently consolidated in our balance sheet as of december  will be removed 
see proposed joint venture and related transactions with bgp below 
for a discussion of factors that could impact our future operating results and financial condition  see item a 
risk factors above 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased million  compared to the corresponding period of  principally due to the continued decline in the global economy  which caused decreased activity and demand for seismic products and services  most notably in our land imaging systems segment 
land imaging systems net revenues decreased by million  to million compared to million during the twelve months ended december  despite the inclusion of aram s full year operating results  the division was strongly impacted by the market decline  which resulted in reduced sales across all product lines compared to marine imaging systems net revenues decreased million to million  compared to million during the year ended december   principally due to the continued decline in the global economy and to delays in the scheduled completion and commissioning of new marine vessels being introduced into the market  which would otherwise have been outfitted by our marine products 
this decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our digifin positioning systems 
our data management solutions net revenues decreased slightly by million  to million compared to million in this decrease was due entirely to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations compared to a year ago 
ion solutions net revenues decreased million  to million  compared to million in the results for reflected decreased multi client data library sales and new venture program sales  partially offset by increases in data processing service revenues 
gross profit and gross profit percentage 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the prior year 
gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the increase in our gross margin percentage was primarily due to the mix of business  especially in our marine imaging systems and our ion solutions segments 
this increase was partially offset by lower margins in our land imaging system division  which were principally the result of increased amortization expense related to aram s acquired intangibles and the headcount reduction restructuring charges taken during the margins for in our data management solutions segment remained flat due to product mix sold when compared to margin levels 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense was million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
the decrease was due primarily to decreased salary and payroll expenses related to our reduced headcount  partially offset by increased professional fees relating to current projects 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense of million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december  decreased million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
the decrease in our sales and marketing expenditures reflects decreased salary and payroll expenses related to reduced headcount  a decrease in travel expenses as part of our cost reduction measures  and a decrease in conventions  exhibits  advertising and office expenses related to cost reduction measures and the timing of the expenses throughout the year 
based upon the recently completed restructuring programs  we expect to continue to incur lower costs related to our marketing and sales efforts than in prior periods as mentioned in executive summary above 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to million in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expense was mainly due to additional stock based compensation expense related to adjustments between estimated and actual award forfeitures of million  of which million is an out of period adjustment 
additionally  general and administrative expenses also reflect the inclusion of aram s expenses in and severance charges related to reductions in headcount 
this increase is partially offset by decreased professional legal fees  travel expenses and general office expenses related to cost reduction measures 
based upon the recently completed restructuring programs  we expect to incur lower costs related to our general and administrative activities than in prior periods as mentioned in executive summary above 
impairment of intangible assets 
at march   we further evaluated our intangible assets for potential impairment 
based upon our evaluation and given the current market conditions  we determined that approximately million of proprietary technology and customer relationships written off entirely related to aram acquired intangibles were impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to aram s customer relationships  trade name and non compete agreements 
our net book value associated with aram s acquired intangibles is million at december  and has a remaining weighted average life of years 
interest expense  including amortization of a non cash debt discount 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to million for the corresponding period last year 
the increase is due to the higher levels of outstanding indebtedness and the secured equipment financing transaction that occurred during the second and third quarters of combined with increased revolver borrowings of million and higher prevailing average interest rates in compared to also  during the year ended december   we amortized to interest expense million of a non cash debt discount associated with the convertible notes 
the remaining unamortized non cash debt discount was million at december  and will be recognized over the expected term of the convertible notes march  
see further discussion of the convertible notes and other bridge financing arrangements related to bgp and the bank of china at proposed joint venture and related transactions with bgp and liquidity and capital resources sources of capital 
because of these increased levels of borrowed indebtedness  our interest expense will continue to be significantly higher in than we experienced in prior years  however  with the closing of the proposed joint venture with bgp and the subsequent re financing of the amended credit facility  the company believes that its interest expense will decrease compared to fair value adjustment of the warrant 
we are required to account for separately and adjust to fair value the warrant 
we recorded a non cash fair value adjustment of million  reflecting a total non cash liability associated with the warrant of million at december  we will continue to adjust the warrant to fair value until such time as it is exercised or converted into our equity at the closing of the joint venture  which is expected to occur in march also  associated with the warrant  we recorded a million non cash discount on the convertible notes  which is being amortized to interest expense see discussion above over the expected term of the notes march  
impairment of cost method investment 
at december   we evaluated our cost method investments for potential impairments 
based upon our evaluation and given the current market conditions related to our investment in colibrys  ltd  we determined that the investment was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
other income expense 
other expense for the year ended december  was million compared to other income of million for the other expense for mainly relates to higher foreign currency exchange losses that primarily resulted from our operations in the united kingdom and canada 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million compared to million of tax expense for the year ended december  the increase in tax benefits during primarily relates to reduced consolidated income from operations 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our us net deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the similar period during the increase in our effective tax rate relates primarily to the impairment of goodwill  which has no tax benefit 
preferred stock dividends 
the preferred stock dividend relates to our series d  series d and series d cumulative convertible preferred stock collectively referred to as the series d preferred stock that we issued in february  december and february  respectively 
quarterly dividends must be paid in cash 
dividends are paid at a rate equal to the greater of i per annum or ii the three month libor rate on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus per annum 
all dividends paid to date on the series d preferred stock have been paid in cash 
the series d preferred stock dividend rate was at december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased million  compared to the corresponding period of  principally due to the sharp decline in the global economy  which caused decreased activity and demand for seismic services  most notably in our land imaging systems segment 
land imaging systems net revenues decreased by million  to million compared to million during the twelve months ended december  despite the inclusion of aram s operating results  the division was strongly impacted by the market decline  which resulted in reduced sales of both land systems and vibroseis trucks 
this decrease was also made more pronounced by the inclusion of several large sales of our land acquisition systems that were not duplicated in  including the sale of land acquisition systems to ongc  the sale of our initial version of firefly and significantly increased vibrator truck sales in marine imaging systems net revenues increased million to million  compared to million during the year ended december   principally due to stronger sales of our marine positioning products  including sales related to the full commercialization of our digifin advanced streamer command and control system  the first two commercial sales of our digistreamer system and stronger sales of our marine seismic data acquisition products 
we delivered to rxt the fifth vso system in  however  vso system sales decreased compared to mainly due to the timing of the sales 
our data management solutions net revenues decreased slightly by million  to million compared to million in this change primarily reflects continued energy industry demand for marine seismic work  slightly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between the gbp and the us dollar in ion solutions net revenues increased million  to million  or  compared to million in this increase was due to larger demand related to higher proprietary processing revenues  pre funded multi client seismic surveys primarily off the coasts of alaska and south america and sales of off the shelf seismic data sales 
sales of our pre funded multi client seismic surveys and of off the shelf seismic data increased approximately in compared to gross profit and gross profit percentage 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to the prior year 
gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the improvement in our gross margin percentage was primarily due to the mix of business  including an increase in system sales as well as higher margin sales from our data management solutions segment  including significantly increased sales of our orca software 
this increase was partially offset by slightly lower margins in our land imaging system division relating to inventory write downs directly related to the integration activities of aram into our current operating segment and in our ion solutions segment due to the change in product mix with higher levels of proprietary processing sales 
during  we also wrote down the carrying values of certain of our mature analog land systems and related equipment inventory  resulting in a million charge 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense was million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
we expect to continue to incur research  development and engineering expenses in at a more conservative rate than in prior years  as we continue to invest in our next generation of seismic acquisition products and services 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense of million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december  increased million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
the increase in our sales and marketing expenditures reflects the hiring of additional sales personnel  increased exhibit and convention costs and increased travel associated with our global marketing efforts 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our corporate branding expenses in  due to the higher expenses in associated with our name change that year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to million in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in expenditures was primarily due to increases in our bad debt reserves of million  in our professional fees relating to our financing efforts of million  in salaries and related expenses of million due to the hiring of additional personnel and an increase in general office expenses related to our acquisition of aram 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense due to the lower operating performance compared to s operating performance 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
at december   we evaluated our reporting units for potential impairment 
based upon our evaluation and given the current market conditions  we determined that approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets related to our land imaging systems  aram systems and ion solutions reporting units were impaired 
we recorded the expense as of december  and reduced the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to income tax expense of million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in tax expense during primarily relates to reduced consolidated income from operations and changes to the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets 
this decrease was partially offset by deferred taxes on the utilization of acquired net operating losses 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our us net deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the similar period during the decreased effective tax rate for relates primarily to the impairment of goodwill  which has no tax benefit  and a reduction in the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets offset by deferred tax expense related to the utilization of acquired net operating losses of million 
the and effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rate due to the goodwill impairment in and to the utilization of previously reserved us deferred tax assets in both and preferred stock dividends and accretion 
the preferred stock dividend relates to our series d preferred stock that we issued in february  december and february quarterly dividends must be paid in cash 
dividends are paid at a rate equal to the greater of i per annum or ii the three month libor rate on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus per annum 
all dividends paid to date on the series d preferred stock have been paid in cash 
the series d preferred stock dividend rate was at december  adjustments from preferred stock redemption and conversion features 
our results of operations for reflected additional credits to and charges against our earnings resulting from our outstanding series d cumulative convertible preferred stock the series d preferred stock  series d cumulative convertible preferred stock the series d preferred stock and series d cumulative convertible preferred stock the series d preferred stock and together with the series d preferred stock and the series d preferred stock  the series d preferred stock 
on november   we delivered a notice the reset notice to fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher of our election to reset the conversion prices on our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock 
see liquidity and capital resources sources of capital cumulative convertible preferred stock 
fletcher is the holder of all of the outstanding shares of our series d preferred stock 
by delivering the reset notice to fletcher  we reset the conversion prices on all of our series d preferred stock to per share  in accordance with the terms of our agreement with fletcher dated as of february  as amended  the fletcher agreement 
under the fletcher agreement  if a day volume weighted average trading price per share of our common stock fell below the minimum price  we would be required to i thereafter pay all dividends on shares of series d preferred stock only in cash and ii elect to either a satisfy future redemption obligations by distributing only cash or a combination of cash and common stock  or b reset the conversion prices of all of outstanding shares of series d preferred stock to the minimum price  in which event the series d preferred stock holder would have no further rights to call for the redemption of those shares 
we had originally classified the preferred stock outside of stockholders equity on the balance sheet below total liabilities 
however  with the termination of the redemption rights  there are no other provisions that require cash redemption 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified the preferred stock to stockholders equity 
the redemption features of our outstanding series d preferred stock and series d preferred stock had been considered embedded derivatives that were required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately at their fair value during these features had been bifurcated as a separate line item in the liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet 
for each quarter during  these redemption features had been re measured at quarter end at their fair value with any resulting gain or loss recognized below income from operations and reflected in earnings for the period 
as a result of the election we made under the reset notice  fletcher is no longer permitted to redeem any shares of our series d preferred stock and the original value of the redemption features of million was credited to and reflected in other income in the fourth quarter of preferred stock beneficial conversion charge 
as a result of the reset notice and the adjustment in november of the conversion prices for the series d preferred stock to the minimum price of per share under the fletcher agreement  we recognized in the fourth quarter of a contingent beneficial conversion feature of the series d preferred stock as a non cash charge to earnings in the amount of million 
under applicable financial accounting guidance  the adjustment of reducing the conversion price was deemed to be equivalent to value being transferred to the holder of the series d preferred stock  with such holder thereby realizing enhanced economic value compared to the holders of other ion securities that did not hold a beneficial conversion feature 
this feature was calculated at its intrinsic value at the original commitment date  and the amount of the charge was limited to the amount of proceeds allocated to the convertible instruments ie the series d preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources sources of capital our cash requirements include our working capital requirements  debt service payments  dividend payments on our preferred stock  data acquisitions and capital expenditures 
in recent years  our primary sources of funds have been cash flow from operations  existing cash balances  equity issuances and our revolving credit facility see revolving line of credit and term loan facilities below 
at december   our outstanding credit facilities and debt consisted of our amended credit facility  comprised of an amended revolving line of credit sub facility including the additional million of revolving credit indebtedness evidenced by the convertible notes  and a million original principal amount term loan  a million secured equipment financing term loan  and a million amended and restated subordinated promissory note 
revolving line of credit and term loan facilities 
in july  we  ion s rl  and certain of our domestic and other foreign subsidiaries as guarantors entered into a million amended and restated revolving credit facility under the terms of an amended credit agreement with our commercial bank lenders this agreement  as it has been further amended  is referred to our amended credit agreement 
the revolving credit facility terminates on july  this amended and restated revolving credit facility provided us with additional flexibility for our international capital needs by not only permitting borrowings by one of our foreign subsidiaries under the facility but also providing us the ability to borrow in alternative currencies 
on september   we added a new million term loan sub facility under the amended credit agreement  and borrowed million in term loan indebtedness and million under the revolving credit sub facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the aram acquisition 
the interest rate on borrowings under our amended credit facility is  at our option  i an alternate base rate either the prime rate of hsbc bank usa  na  or a federals funds effective rate plus  plus an applicable interest margin or ii for eurodollar borrowings and borrowings in euros  pounds sterling or canadian dollars  a libor based rate  plus an applicable interest margin 
the amount of the applicable interest margin is determined by reference to a leverage ratio of total funded debt to consolidated ebitda for the four most recent trailing fiscal quarters 
the interest rate margins currently range from to for alternate base rate borrowings  and from to for eurodollar borrowings 
as of december   both the million in term loan indebtedness under the amended credit facility and the million in total revolving credit indebtedness under the amended credit facility accrued interest at the then applicable libor based interest rate of per annum 
the average effective interest rates for the quarter ended december  under the libor based rates for both the term loan indebtedness and the revolving credit indebtedness were 
at march   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the terms of the amended credit facility 
however  based upon our results for that quarter and our then current operating forecast for the remainder of  we determined that it was probable that  if we did not take any mitigating actions  we would not be in compliance for the period ending september  with one or more financial covenants under the amended credit facility s debt agreements 
as a result  we approached the lenders under the amended credit facility to obtain amendments to relax certain of these financial covenants and pursued the private placement of our common stock  which  along with our cash on hand  generated sufficient funds to repay the outstanding indebtedness under a bridge loan agreement that we had entered into with jefferies finance  llc in december see further discussion of the private placement transaction below at private placement of million shares of common stock 
fifth amendment to amended credit facility 
in june  we entered into an additional amendment the fifth amendment to our amended credit facility that  among other things  modified certain of the financial and other covenants contained in the amended credit facility and permitted us to repay our jefferies bridge loan indebtedness 
principal modifications to the terms of the amended credit agreement resulting from the fifth amendment included the following an increase in applicable maximum interest rate margins in the event that our leverage ratio exceeds to from to up to for alternate base rate loans  and from to up to for libor rate loans  a modified restricted payments covenant that permitted us to apply up to million of our available cash on hand to prepay the indebtedness under the jefferies bridge loan agreement  a new defined term  excess cash flow  and a new requirement for us to apply of our excess cash flow  if any  calculated with respect to a just completed fiscal year  to the prepayment of the term loan under the amended credit agreement if our fixed charge coverage ratio or our leverage ratio for the just completed fiscal year does not meet certain requirements  and an amendment to fix the maximum revolving credit facility accordion feature amount to which the amended credit facility could be increased at million 
the amended credit agreement contains covenants that restrict us  subject to certain exceptions  from incurring additional indebtedness including capital lease obligations  granting or incurring additional liens on our properties  pledging shares of our subsidiaries  entering into certain merger or other similar transactions  entering into transactions with affiliates  making certain sales or other dispositions of assets  making certain investments  acquiring other businesses and entering into certain sale leaseback transactions with respect to certain of our properties  paying cash dividends on our common stock and repurchasing and acquiring shares of our common stock unless i there is no event of default under the amended credit facility and ii the amount of cash used for cash dividends  repurchases and acquisitions does not  in the aggregate  exceed an amount equal to the excess of of our domestic consolidated net income for our most recently completed fiscal year over million 
the amended credit facility requires us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants  including requirements for us and our domestic subsidiaries to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which must be not less than to for the fiscal quarter ended december   to for the fiscal quarter ending march   to for the fiscal quarter ending june   to for the fiscal quarter ending september   and to the fiscal quarter ending december  and thereafter  not exceed a maximum leverage ratio to for the fiscal quarters ended december   to for the fiscal quarter ending march  and june   to for the fiscal quarter ending september   and to the fiscal quarter ending december  and thereafter  and maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least of our tangible net worth as of september  the date that we completed our acquisition of aram  plus of our consolidated net income for each quarter thereafter  and of the proceeds from any mandatorily convertible notes and preferred and common stock issuances for each quarter thereafter 
the term loan indebtedness we borrowed under the amended credit facility is subject to scheduled quarterly amortization payments of million per quarter until december  on that date  the quarterly principal amortization increases to million per quarter until december   when the quarterly principal amortization amount increases to million for each quarter until maturity on september  the term loan indebtedness matures on september   but the administrative agent under the amended credit facility may accelerate the maturity date to a date that is six months prior to the maturity date of any additional debt financing that we may incur to refinance certain indebtedness incurred in connection with the aram acquisition  by giving us written notice of such acceleration between september  and october  the amended credit facility contains customary event of default provisions including an event of default upon any change of control event affecting us  the occurrence of which could lead to an acceleration of ion s obligations under the amended credit facility 
sixth amendment to amended credit facility 
on october   we entered into a sixth amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement that  among other things  i increased the aggregate revolving commitment amount under the amended credit facility from million to million  ii permitted bank of china  new york branch  to join the amended credit facility  iii modified  or provided limited waivers of  certain of the financial and other covenants contained in the amended credit facility including waivers to the extent necessary to permit the issuance of the bgp warrant and iv permitted the principal amount of the new revolving credit loans from bank of china as evidenced by the convertible notes to be convertible into shares of our common stock 
we borrowed on october  an aggregate of million in revolving credit indebtedness under the amended credit facility as amended by the sixth amendment  pursuant to the convertible notes 
the convertible notes were issued by ion geophysical corporation and ion s rl to bank of china under the terms and conditions of the amended credit facility 
the outstanding indebtedness under the convertible notes is currently scheduled to mature on the maturity date of the revolving credit indebtedness under the amended credit facility  which is july  under the terms of the amended credit agreement  up to million or its equivalent in foreign currencies is available for non us borrowings by ion s rl and up to million is available for domestic borrowings in the us  however  the total level of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility cannot exceed million 
revolving credit borrowings under the amended credit facility are available to fund our working capital needs  to finance acquisitions  investments and share repurchases and for general corporate purposes 
in addition  the amended credit facility includes a million sub limit for the issuance of documentary and stand by letters of credit  of which million was outstanding at december  borrowings under the amended credit facility may be prepaid without penalty 
as a result of our october bridge financing arrangements with bank of china in connection with the sixth amendment  we believe that our liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the first quarter of the execution of the sixth amendment  which included waivers of the financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility for the fiscal quarters ending september   december   march  and june   should enable us to conduct our operations without defaulting under the amended credit facility until the transactions with bgp are completed  which we currently believe will occur in march without these waivers  we would not have been in compliance with certain of our financial covenants at september  or december  if the proposed transactions under the term sheet are not completed by march   then the current waivers  upon notice from the lenders after a designated period of time  would cease to be effective and we  at that time  would likely not be in compliance with certain of the financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility  which could then result in an event of default 
as the current waivers cover a period of less than twelve months from december   we have classified our long term indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and term loan facility under the amended credit facility as current at december  as a result of the cross default provisions in our secured equipment financing and our amended and restated subordinated seller note  we have also classified these long term obligations as current at december  even though we believe the joint venture with bgp will be completed as planned  there are certain events outside of our control such as our experiencing a material adverse event or condition that results in a material adverse effect on our business  its prospects or results of operations that could cause the closing of the joint venture to be delayed  terminated or abandoned 
in such event  we would need to seek to amend  or seek additional covenant waivers under  the amended credit facility 
even though the lenders under the amended credit facility have demonstrated their willingness to work with us in amending or providing sufficient waivers to our facility  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments in the future 
if we were unable to obtain such waivers or amendments from the lenders  we would likely seek to replace or pay off the amended credit facility with new secured debt  unsecured debt or equity financing 
convertible notes and warrant 
on october   we borrowed an aggregate of million in the form of revolving credit bridge financing arranged by bgp from bank of china  new york branch  which was evidenced by the convertible notes 
this borrowing was permitted by the terms of the sixth amendment to the credit facility  which increased the aggregate revolving commitment amount under the accordion feature provisions of the amended credit facility from million to million and permitted bank of china to join the amended credit facility as a lender 
as further described above  the total outstanding indebtedness under the amended credit facility  which includes the bank of china bridge loans  was million  excluding the non cash debt discount  at december  the convertible notes  issued in october in connection with the execution of the term sheet with bgp  provide that at the stated initial conversion price of per share  the full million principal amount under the convertible notes would be convertible into  shares of common stock 
the convertible notes provide that the conversion price and the number of shares into which the notes may be converted are subject to adjustment under certain terms and conditions similar to those contained in the warrant 
as part of bgp arranging for the bank of china to join our amended credit facility  we granted to bgp the warrant 
the warrant will be exercisable  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  subject to the conditions described below 
the warrant will initially entitle the holder thereof to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to million divided by the exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment as described below 
at the initial exercise price of per share  at such time as the warrant becomes exercisable  it would initially be fully exercisable for  shares of common stock 
the warrant will only become exercisable and the convertible notes will only become convertible upon receipt of certain governmental approvals 
any conversions of the convertible notes and prior exercises of the warrant will reduce the dollar amount under the warrant into which the exercise price may be divided to determine the number of shares that may be acquired upon exercise 
the exercise price under the warrant and conversion prices under the convertible notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
a triggering event will occur in the event that the joint venture transactions cannot be completed by march   solely as a result of the occurrence of a statement  order or other indication from any relevant governmental regulatory agency that a the transactions would not be approved  would be opposed  objected to or sanctioned or b the transactions or bgp s business and operations would be required to be altered or upon the earlier abandonment of such transactions due to any such statement  indication or order 
in such event  the exercise price and conversion price per share will be adjusted but not to an amount that exceeds per share to a price per share that is equal to of the lowest trading price of our common stock over a ten consecutive trading day period  beginning on and inclusive of the first trading day following the public announcement of any failure to complete such transactions or the abandonment thereof  which failure of abandonment was the result of the triggering event 
the exercise price of the warrant and conversion prices of the convertible notes are also subject to certain customary anti dilution adjustment 
the warrant provides for certain cashless exercise rights that are exercisable by the holder of the warrant in the event that certain governmental approvals from the people s republic of china permitting the exercise of the warrant for cash are not obtained 
at the same time as the closing of the joint venture transactions  all of the then outstanding principal amounts under the convertible notes will be automatically converted into shares of common stock unless  at the option of the holder of the warrant  the holder elects to exercise the warrant in whole or in part  in lieu of the full conversion of such remaining principal amounts under the convertible notes 
assuming that no adjustments occur to the exercise or conversion prices of or the number of shares to be issued under the warrant or the convertible notes prior to closing the joint venture transactions  the term sheet provides that at the closing of the transactions  bgp would purchase directly from us a number of shares of common stock at a purchase price of per shares such that  when added to the total number of shares of common stock that may have been previously issued pursuant to conversion of the convertible notes and or exercise of the warrant  bgp and its transferees and permitted assignees would own  together  before giving effect to the issuance of those shares  approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock ie  shares 
see further discussion of the accounting impact of the warrant at critical accounting policies and estimates fair value of the warrant 
secured equipment financing 
on june   we entered into a million secured equipment financing transaction with icon ion  llc icon  an affiliate of icon capital inc two master loan agreements were entered into with icon in connection with this transaction i we  aram rentals corporation  a nova scotia unlimited company arc  and icon entered into a canadian master loan and security agreement dated as of june  with regard to certain equipment leased to customers by arc  and ii we  aram seismic rentals  inc  a texas corporation asri  and icon entered into a master loan and security agreement us dated as of june  with regard to certain equipment leased to customers by asri collectively  the icon loan agreements 
all borrowed indebtedness under the icon loan agreements is scheduled to mature on july  we used the proceeds of the secured term loans for working capital and general corporate purposes 
under the terms of the icon loan agreements  icon advanced million on june  and million on july  the indebtedness under the icon loan agreements is secured by first priority liens in a certain of our aram seismic rental equipment located in the united states and canada subject to certain exceptions  and certain additional and replacement seismic equipment  b written leases or other agreements evidencing payment obligations relating to the leasing by arc or asri of this equipment to their respective customers  including their related receivables  c the cash or cash equivalents held by such subsidiaries and d any proceeds thereof 
the obligations of each of arc and asri under the icon loan agreements are guaranteed by us under a guaranty dated as of june  the icon guaranty 
the icon loan agreements and the icon guaranty constitute permitted indebtedness under the amended credit facility 
under both icon loan agreements  interest on the outstanding principal amount will accrue at a fixed interest rate of per annum calculated monthly  and is payable monthly on the first day of each month 
principal and interest are payable  commencing on september   in monthly installments until the maturity date  when all remaining outstanding principal and interest will be due and payable 
pursuant to the icon loan agreements  in connection with the closing in june  arc and asri paid icon a non refundable upfront fee of million 
in addition  icon will receive an administrative fee equal to of the aggregate principal amount of advances under the icon loan agreements  payable at the end of each of the first four years during their terms 
inclusive of these additional fees  the effective interest rate on the icon loan was as of december  beginning on august   and continuing until january   we may prepay the outstanding principal balances of the loans in full by giving icon days prior written notice and paying a prepayment fee equal to of the then outstanding principal amount of the loans 
commencing on february   the loans may be prepaid in full without payment of any prepayment penalty or fee  subject to our giving icon days prior written notice 
the icon loan agreements contain certain cross default provisions with respect to defaults under our amended credit facility 
therefore  similar to the current classification of the amended credit facility indebtedness  we have also classified this long term indebtedness as current 
assuming that the bgp joint venture transaction is completed as planned  we anticipate that the primary obligation to repay the icon indebtedness will be assumed by the joint venture  and the obligations under the guaranty will be assumed by a joint venture entity  although it is also expected that we would remain secondarily liable on the guaranty by backstopping the joint venture entity s guaranty of the primary repayment obligations 
amended and restated subordinated seller note 
as part of the purchase price for the aram acquisition  one of our subsidiaries issued an unsecured senior promissory note the senior seller note in the original principal amount of million to maison mazel ltd  one of the selling shareholders of aram 
on december   in connection with other acquisition refinancing transactions that were completed on that date  the senior seller note was amended and restated pursuant to an amended and restated subordinated promissory note the amended and restated subordinated note issued to maison mazel  the selling shareholder 
the principal amount of the amended and restated subordinated note is million and matures on september  we also entered into a guaranty dated december   whereby we guaranteed on a subordinated basis the subsidiary s repayment obligations under the amended and restated subordinated note 
effective april   i the subsidiary transferred the amended and restated subordinated note to us and we assumed in full the obligations of ion sub under such note  and ii our guaranty of payment of the indebtedness under the amended and restated subordinated note was terminated 
the subsidiary was also released from its obligations under the amended and restated promissory note by maison mazel 
interest on the outstanding principal amount under the amended and restated subordinated note accrues at the rate of fifteen percent per annum  and is payable quarterly 
the terms of the amended and restated subordinated note provide that the particular covenants contained in the amended credit agreement or in any successor agreement or instrument that restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be incorporated into the amended and restated subordinated note 
however  under the amended and restated subordinated note  neither maison mazel nor any other holder of the amended and restated subordinated note will have a separate right to consent to or approve any amendment or waiver of the covenant as contained in the amended credit facility 
in addition  we have agreed that if we incur indebtedness under any financing that qualifies as long term junior financing as defined in the amended credit agreement  results from a refinancing or replacement of the amended credit facility such that the aggregate principal indebtedness including revolving commitments thereunder would be in excess of million  or qualifies as unsecured indebtedness for borrowed money that is evidenced by notes or debentures  has a maturity date of at least five years after the date of its issuance and results in total gross cash proceeds to us of not less than million  then we will be obligated to repay in full from the total proceeds from such financing the then outstanding principal of and interest on the amended and restated subordinated note 
the indebtedness under the amended and restated subordinated note is subordinated to the prior payment in full of our senior obligations  which are defined in the amended and restated subordinated note as the principal  premium if any  interest and other amounts that become due in connection with our obligations under the amended credit facility  our liabilities with respect to capital leases and obligations that qualify as a sale leaseback agreement as that term is defined in the amended credit agreement  guarantees of the indebtedness described above  and debentures  notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued in exchange for  or in the refinancing of  the senior obligations described above  or any indebtedness arising from the payment and satisfaction of any senior obligations by a guarantor 
it is contemplated that at the closing of the joint venture transactions  we will obtain sources of financing sufficient to enable us to repay in full the indebtedness under the amended and restated subordinated note 
the amended and restated subordinated seller note contains certain cross default provisions with respect to defaults and acceleration of indebtedness under our amended credit facility 
therefore  similar to the current classification of the amended credit facility  we have also classified this long term indebtedness as current 
private placement of million shares of common stock 
on june   we completed the offering and sale of  shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions with several institutional investors 
the purchase price per share of common stock sold was  representing total gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering of million were applied  along with million of our cash on hand  to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness under the bridge loan agreement 
in accordance with the terms of the stock purchase agreements  we filed with the sec on june   a registration statement with respect to potential resales of the shares purchased by the investors  which was declared effective on june  the offering and sale by us of the shares of common stock in the private placement were not registered under the securities act of  as amended  in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of that act 
cumulative convertible preferred stock 
during  we entered into an agreement dated february  with fletcher this agreement  as amended to the date hereof  is referred to as the fletcher agreement and issued to fletcher  shares of our series d preferred stock in a privately negotiated transaction  receiving million in net proceeds 
the fletcher agreement also provided to fletcher an option to purchase up to an additional  shares of additional series of preferred stock from time to time  with each series having a conversion price that would be equal to of an average daily volume weighted market price of our common stock over a trailing period of days at the time of issuance of that series 
in and  fletcher exercised this option and purchased  shares of series d preferred stock for million in december and the remaining  shares of series d preferred stock for million in february 
fletcher remains the sole holder of all of our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock 
dividends on the shares of series d preferred stock must be paid in cash 
under the fletcher agreement  if a day volume weighted average trading price per share of our common stock fell below the minimum price  we were required to deliver a notice the reset notice to fletcher 
on november   the day volume weighted average trading price per share of our common stock on the new york stock exchange for the previous trading days was calculated to be  and we delivered the reset notice to fletcher in accordance with the terms of the fletcher agreement 
in the reset notice  we elected to reset the conversion prices for the series d preferred stock to the minimum price per share  and fletcher s redemption rights were terminated 
the adjusted conversion price resulting from this election was effective on november  in addition  under the fletcher agreement  the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued or issuable to fletcher upon conversion or redemption of  or as dividends paid on  the series d preferred stock could not exceed a designated maximum number of shares the maximum number  and such maximum number could be increased by fletcher providing us with a day notice of increase  but under no circumstance could the total number of shares of common stock issued or issuable to fletcher with respect to the series d preferred stock ever exceed  shares 
the fletcher agreement had designated  shares as the original maximum number 
on november   fletcher purported to deliver a second notice to us to increase the maximum number to  shares  effective february  on september   fletcher delivered a notice to us purporting to increase the maximum number from  shares to  shares  to become effective on november  we believe that our agreement with fletcher gives fletcher the right to issue only one notice to increase the maximum number 
on november   we filed an action in the court of chancery of the state of delaware seeking a declaration that  under the relevant agreement  fletcher is permitted to deliver only one notice to increase the maximum number and that its purported second notice is legally invalid 
the conversion prices and number of shares of common stock to be acquired upon conversion are also subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
converting the shares of series d preferred stock at one time could result in significant dilution to our stockholders that could limit our ability to raise additional capital 
certain rights and obligations of fletcher and our company pertaining to the series d preferred stock are currently the subject of pending litigation in the chancery court of the state of delaware 
see item legal proceedings and item a 
risk factors 
meeting our liquidity requirements as of december   our total outstanding indebtedness including capital lease obligations was approximately million  net of a million non cash debt discount  consisting of approximately million in borrowings under the term loans and million  excluding the non cash debt discount  in revolving credit indebtedness under the amended credit facility  million of borrowings under our new secured equipment financing and million of outstanding subordinated indebtedness under the amended and restated subordinated note 
the repayment in full in june of the million bridge loan agreement indebtedness was significant because it represented at that time short term indebtedness that was scheduled to mature in january inclusive of the additional fees and an upfront fee previously paid of  the effective interest rate under the bridge loan agreement was at the time of repayment 
currently  under their terms  none of our principal debt facilities mature prior to we had disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june  that  as a result of our entering into the fifth amendment  repaying the indebtedness outstanding under the bridge loan agreement and entering into the secured equipment financing transaction in june  we expected that we would remain in compliance with the financial covenants under the amended credit facility and that our cash on hand and cash generated from our operations would be sufficient to fund our operations for the remainder of however  lower than expected sales revenues realized during the third quarter of resulted in a high likelihood that  as of september   we would not be in compliance with certain of such financial covenants 
as a result  we entered into the sixth amendment of our amended credit facility  which  among other things  included waivers of the financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility for the fiscal quarters ending september   december   march  and june  these waivers should enable us to conduct our operations without defaulting under the amended credit facility until the transactions with bgp are completed  which we currently believe will occur in march without these waivers  we would not have been in compliance with certain of our financial covenants at september  or december  as a result of obtaining the million of additional revolving credit indebtedness under the convertible notes in october and entering into the sixth amendment  we believe that our liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as the transactions with bgp are completed or alternate financing could be obtained 
if the proposed transactions under the term sheet with bgp are not completed by march   then the current waivers  upon notice from the lenders after a designated period of time  would cease to be effective and we at that time would likely not be in compliance with certain of the financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility  which could then result in an event of default 
as the current waivers cover a period of less than twelve months from december   we have classified our long term indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and term loan facility under the amended credit facility as current at december  as a result of the cross default provisions in our secured equipment financing and our amended and restated subordinated seller note  we have also classified these long term obligations as current at december  even though we believe the joint venture with bgp will be completed as planned  there are certain events outside of the our control such as us experiencing a material adverse event or condition that results in a material adverse effect on our business  our prospects or results of operations that could cause the closing of the joint venture to be delayed  terminated or abandoned 
in such event  we would need to seek to amend  or seek additional covenant waivers under  the amended credit facility 
even though the lenders under the amended credit facility have demonstrated their willingness to work with us in amending or providing sufficient waivers to its facility  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments in the future 
if we were to be unable to obtain such waivers or amendments from the lenders  we would likely seek to replace or pay off the amended credit facility with new secured debt  unsecured debt or equity financing 
as part of the formation of the joint venture  we have been in discussions with various financial institutions both domestic and international on the refinancing of our debt 
as a result of these discussions and with the recent improvements within the financial markets  we believe that in the unlikely event the joint venture is not completed as planned  we would be able to obtain additional debt or equity financings prior to defaulting on our current debt obligations 
however  there also can be no assurance that such debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
for the year ended december   total capital expenditures  including investments in our multi client data library  were million  and we are projecting capital expenditures for the year to be between million to million 
if there continues to be weak demand for our products and services  we would expect continued reduced levels of capital expenditures  which may  in turn  lessen our requirements for working capital 
of the total projected capital expenditures  we are estimating that approximately million to million will be spent on investments in our multi client data library  but we are anticipating that most of these investments will be underwritten by our customers 
to the extent our customers commitments do not reach an acceptable level of pre funding  the amount of our anticipated investment in these data libraries could be significantly less 
cash flow from operations we have historically financed our operations from internally generated cash and funds from equity and debt financings 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   a decrease of million compared to december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided in our operating activities was primarily due to decreased accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in our inventories  a decrease in accounts receivable resulting from lower sales levels and increased collections on our receivables and a decrease in our unbilled receivables due to lower sales levels and the timing of the invoicing of those sales 
we are continuing to adjust our manufacturing and purchasing plans in order to focus on continuing to make sales from the remaining inventory and thereby further reduce current levels of inventory 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   a decrease of million compared to december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided in our operating activities was primarily due to increased accrued liabilities and accounts payable as well as decreased accounts receivable resulting from increased collections in this increase was partially offset by increased investment in our inventories 
we have adjusted our manufacturing and purchasing plans in order that we can focus on making sales from this inventory in order to reduce our current levels of inventory 
cash flow from investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the principal uses of our cash for investing activities during the year ended december  were a million investment in our multi client data library and million of equipment and rental equipment purchases 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the principal uses of our cash for investing activities during the year ended december  were million expended to acquire aram in september  million of equipment and rental equipment purchases and a million investment in our multi client data library 
this was partially offset by million of cash we acquired in the aram acquisition and proceeds from the sale of assets and rental assets of million 
cash flow from financing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net cash flow provided by financing activities during primarily consisted of million in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility  net proceeds from the icon secured rental equipment financing transaction of million  and the net proceeds of million from a private placement of our common stock in june this cash inflow was partially offset by scheduled principal payments on our term loan under our amended credit facility  the prepayment of the principal balance on the jefferies bridge loan indebtedness and payments under our other notes payable and capital lease obligations all totaling million 
additionally  we paid million in cash dividends on our outstanding series d  series d and series d preferred stock and million in financing costs related to our debt transactions and amendments to our debt facilities during the twelve months ended december  net cash flow provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net cash flow provided by financing activities during was primarily related to million of net proceeds from acquisition debt we borrowed to purchase aram  million of net borrowings on our revolving credit facility  million in proceeds from the issuance and sale of our series d preferred stock in february and million in proceeds related to the exercise of stock options and stock purchases by our employees under our employee plans 
this cash inflow was partially offset by scheduled principal payments of million on our notes payable and capital lease obligations and million in cash dividends paid on our outstanding series d  series d and series d preferred stock 
inflation and seasonality inflation in recent years has not had a material effect on our costs of goods or labor  or the prices for our products or services 
traditionally  our business has been seasonal  with strongest demand in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
the fourth quarter of was not as strong as seen historically because the typical discretionary spending that normally occurs during the fourth quarter was not realized 
future contractual obligations the following table was compiled based upon the current presentation of our debt in our balance sheet and not on the original terms and maturity dates of the respective debt instruments 
the table below also does not include the non cash debt discount of million but instead lists the contractual principal amounts since those amounts will be the principal paid at the termination of the contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations  as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years notes payable and long term debt interest on notes payable and long term debt obligations equipment capital lease obligations operating leases product warranty purchase obligations total the long term debt and lease obligations at december  included million  excluding the million non cash debt discount  of revolving credit indebtedness and million under our five year term loan  in each case incurred under our amended credit facility and maturing in the remaining amount of these obligations consists of million under our amended and restated subordinated note  million under the icon loan agreements  million indebtedness related to our stafford  texas facility sale leaseback arrangement and million of short term notes payable 
the million of capital lease obligations relates to aram and gxt s financing of computer and other equipment purchases 
the interest on notes payable and long term debt obligations in the table above are calculated based upon the current presentation of our debt in our balance sheet and not on the original terms and maturity dates of the respective debt instruments 
using the original terms and maturity dates  the interest expense would be million for years and million for years 
see revolving line of credit and term loan facilities above and note notes payable  long term debt and lease obligations 
because we may prepay our outstanding revolving credit indebtedness under the amended credit facility at any time  the interest expense is not included in the above table 
however  if the outstanding principal of million as of december  was not repaid in  the interest expense would be million using the interest rate as of december  for further discussion of our notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations  see note notes payable  long term debt and lease obligations 
the non cash liability associated with fair value of the warrant of million at december  was not reflected in the above table as its settlement upon exercise is only through issuance of our common shares and does not provide for cash settlement 
see further discussion of the accounting impact of the warrant at critical accounting policies and estimates fair value of the warrant 
the operating lease commitments at december  relate to our leases for certain equipment  offices  processing centers  and warehouse space under non cancelable operating leases 
the liability for product warranties at december  relate to the estimated future warranty expenditures associated with our products 
our warranty periods generally range from days to three years from the date of original purchase  depending on the product 
we record an accrual for product warranties and other contingencies at the time of sale  which is when the estimated future expenditures associated with those contingencies become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
we generally receive warranty support from our suppliers regarding equipment they manufactured 
our purchase obligations primarily relate to our committed inventory purchase orders for which deliveries are scheduled to be made in dividends on our series d preferred stock are payable quarterly and must be paid in cash 
in  we paid million in dividends on our series d preferred stock 
the dividend rate was at december  see liquidity and capital resources above 
upon the completion of the joint venture transactions  the icon loan agreements and all outstanding amounts owed under the agreements will be assumed by the joint venture 
in addition  we intend to repay the million under our amended and restated subordinated note and the million of revolving credit indebtedness from the proceeds of the joint venture transaction 
additionally  as of december   approximately million of operating leases  product warranty and purchase obligations related to businesses that will be assumed by the joint venture upon its closing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make choices between acceptable methods of accounting and to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risk and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
we believe that all of the judgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements were reasonable at the time we made them  but circumstances may change requiring us to revise our estimates in ways that could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition 
management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to the estimates in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition and product warranty 
we derive revenue from the sale and rental of i acquisition systems and other seismic equipment within our land imaging systems and marine imaging systems segments  ii imaging services  multi client surveys and licenses of off the shelf data libraries within our ion solutions segment  and iii navigation  survey and quality control software systems within our data management solutions segment 
for the sales of acquisition systems and other seismic equipment  we follow the requirements of asc revenue recognition and recognize revenue when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the acquisition system or other seismic equipment is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case where a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists in the contract  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
our land imaging systems segment receives rental income from the rental of seismic equipment 
the rental is in the form of operating leases as the lease terms range from a couple of days to several months 
rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the operating lease 
revenues from all imaging and other services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from contract services performed on a day rate basis are recognized as the service is performed 
revenues from multi client surveys are recognized as the seismic data is acquired and or processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed 
under this method  we recognize revenues based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers acquired or days processed 
upon completion of a multi client seismic survey  the survey data is considered off the shelf and licenses to the survey data are sold to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the license of a completed multi client survey is represented by the license of one standard set of data 
revenues on licenses of completed multi client data surveys are recognized when a a signed final master geophysical data license agreement and accompanying supplemental license agreement are returned by the customer  b the purchase price for the license is fixed or determinable  c delivery or performance has occurred  and d no significant uncertainty exists as to the customer s obligation  willingness or ability to pay 
in limited situations  we have provided the customer with a right to exchange seismic data for another specific seismic data set 
in these limited situations  we recognize revenue at the earlier of the customer exercising its exchange right or the expiration of the customer s exchange right 
when separate elements such as an acquisition system  other seismic equipment and or imaging services are contained in a single sales arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we follow the requirements of asc accounting for multiple element revenue arrangement  and allocate revenue to each element based upon its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  so long as each such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services 
we generally do not grant return or refund privileges to our customers 
when undelivered elements  such as training courses and engineering services  are inconsequential or perfunctory and not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we recognize revenue on the total contract and make a provision for the costs of the incomplete elements 
for the sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems  we follow the requirements for these transactions of asc software revenue recognition  because in those systems the software is more than incidental to the arrangement as a whole 
following the requirements of asc applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  we consider the hardware within these systems to be a software related item because the software is essential to the hardware s functionality 
as a result  we recognize revenue from sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the software and software related hardware is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case where a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists in the contract  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
these arrangements generally include us providing related services  such as training courses  engineering services and annual software maintenance 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the element or  if vendor specific objective evidence is not available for the delivered element  we apply the residual method 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we offer certain time based software licenses 
for these time based licenses  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term  which is generally two to five years 
we generally warrant that our manufactured equipment will be free from defects in workmanship  material and parts 
warranty periods generally range from days to three years from the date of original purchase  depending on the product 
we provide for estimated warranty as a charge to costs of sales at the time of sale 
multi client data library 
our multi client data library consists of seismic surveys that are offered for licensing to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the capitalized costs include the costs paid to third parties for the acquisition of data and related activities associated with the data creation activity and direct internal processing costs  such as salaries  benefits  computer related expenses  and other costs incurred for seismic data project design and management 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized  as part of our multi client data library million  million  and million  respectively  of direct internal processing costs 
our method of amortizing the costs of a multi client data library available for commercial sale is the greater of i the percentage of actual revenue to the total estimated revenue multiplied by the total cost of the project the sales forecast method or ii the straight line basis over a four year period 
the sales forecast method is our primary method of calculating amortization 
the total amortization period of four years represents the minimum period over which benefits from these surveys are expected to be derived 
we have determined the amortization period of four years based upon our historical experience that indicates that the majority of our revenues from multi client surveys are derived during the acquisition and processing phases and during four years subsequent to survey completion 
estimated sales are determined based upon discussions with our customers  our experience  and our knowledge of industry trends 
changes in sales estimates may have the effect of changing the percentage relationship of cost of services to revenue 
in applying the sales forecast method  an increase in the projected sales of a survey will result in lower cost of services as a percentage of revenue  and higher earnings when revenue associated with that particular survey is recognized  while a decrease in projected sales will have the opposite effect 
assuming that the overall volume of sales mix of surveys generating revenue in the period was held constant in  an increase in in the sales forecasts of all surveys would have decreased our amortization expense by approximately million 
we estimate the ultimate revenue expected to be derived from a particular seismic data survey over its estimated useful economic life to determine the costs to amortize  if greater than straight line amortization 
that estimate is made by us at the project s initiation 
for a completed multi client survey  we review the estimate quarterly 
if during any such review  we determine that the ultimate revenue for a survey is expected to be more or less than the original estimate of total revenue for such survey  we decrease or increase as the case may be the amortization rate attributable to the future revenue from such survey 
in addition  in connection with such reviews  we evaluate the recoverability of the multi client data library  and if required under asc accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  record an impairment charge with respect to such data 
there were no impairment charges during and fair value of the warrant 
we issued the warrant to bgp as part of our proposed joint venture with them  which included bgp arranging for the bank of china to join as a new lender to our amended credit facility 
the warrant is required to be accounted for at its fair value with changes in its fair value being recognized below income from operations in the period of change 
the fair value of the warrant was determined using a black scholes model that the value of the features based upon certain key inputs 
the key input for the black scholes model is the current market price of our common stock  the yield on our common stock dividend payments  risk free interest rates  the expected term march  and our stock s historical and implied volatility 
the most significant inputs are the current market price of our common stock 
holding all other inputs constant  a increase or decrease in our common stock price would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability of million and million  respectively 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories is based on historical sales trends and various other assumptions and judgments  including future demand for our inventory and the timing of market acceptance of our new products 
should these assumptions and judgments not be realized for reasons such as delayed market acceptance of our new products  our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results 
our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  the majority of the increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory in related to our marine imaging systems mature acquisition systems and source products 
the increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories in primarily related to our analog land acquisition systems 
as a result of the integration of aram into our land imaging systems segment  at the end of  we evaluated and determined that market values of certain of our mature analog products were lower than their then current book values 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by asc  we established the following reporting units land imaging systems includes aram  sensor geophone  marine imaging systems  data management solutions  and ion solutions 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted future returns valuation method 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  our impairment test results could differ 
asc requires us to compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting units is less than its carrying value 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december  and determined that all of the goodwill within our land imaging systems including aram and ion solutions reporting units were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the decrease in these reporting units fair value was primarily driven by the overall economic and financial crisis and the decrease in the current demand for our land analog acquisition products  especially within north america and russia 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december  and determined that no goodwill was impaired 
our remaining goodwill as of december  was comprised of million in our marine imaging systems and million in our data management solutions reporting units 
our annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of these two reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values by over for each business unit 
the analyses are based upon the operating forecasts approved annually by the board of directors  which include assumptions about market and economic conditions 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
if the operational results of our segments are lower than forecasted or the economic conditions are worse than expected  then the fair value of our segments will be adversely affected 
our intangible assets other than goodwill relate to proprietary technology  patents  customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements that are amortized over the estimated periods of benefit ranging from to years 
following the guidance of asc  we review the carrying values of these intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
any impairment determined is recorded in the current period and is measured by comparing the fair value of the related asset to its carrying value 
for the years ended december  and  we determined that certain of the intangible assets customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements associated with our aram acquisition were impaired and recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
similar to our treatment of goodwill  in making these assessments we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  internal and external economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and external market data 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
accounts and notes receivable collectibility 
we consider current information and circumstances regarding our customers ability to repay their obligations  such as the length of time the receivable balance is outstanding  the customers credit worthiness and historical experience  and consider an account or note impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due 
when we consider a note receivable as impaired  we measure the amount of the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows or the fair value of collateral 
we include impairment losses recoveries in our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes through an increase decrease in bad debt expense 
we record interest income on investments in notes receivable on the accrual basis of accounting 
we do not accrue interest on impaired loans where collection of interest according to the contractual terms is considered doubtful 
among the factors we consider in making an evaluation of the collectibility of interest are i the status of the loan  ii the fair value of the underlying collateral  iii the financial condition of the borrower  and iv anticipated future events 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation under the recognition provisions of asc share based payment 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
the accompanying financial statements for the twelve months ended december  include approximately million of stock based compensation expense related to  and asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the prior period stock based compensation expense relates to adjustments between estimated and actual forfeitures which should have been recognized over the vesting period of such awards 
such amounts were not deemed material with respect to either the results of prior years or the results and the trend of earnings for the current year and were therefore recorded in in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to our employees outstanding stock based awards 
the total expense in was comprised of million reflected in cost of sales  million in research and development expense  million in marketing and sales expense  and million including the million stock based compensation charge described above in general and administrative expense 
in addition to the share based compensation expense related to the company s plans  we recorded million of share based compensation expense in related to employee stock appreciation rights 
pursuant to asc  the stock appreciation rights are considered liability awards and  as such  these amounts are accrued in the liability section of the balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounts standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
on asc  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu amended guidance related to multiple element arrangements which requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
the consensus eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and requires the relative selling price method in all circumstances 
all entities must adopt the guidance no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning on or after june  entities may elect to adopt the guidance through either prospective application for revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  after the effective date or through retrospective application to all revenue arrangements for all periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of asu on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
on asc  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu amended guidance that is expected to significantly affect how entities account for revenue arrangements that contain both hardware and software elements 
as a result  many tangible products that rely on software will be accounted for under the revised multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance  rather than the software revenue recognition guidance 
the revised guidance must be adopted by all entities no later than fiscal years beginning on or after june  an entity must select the same transition method and same period for the adoption of both this guidance and the revisions to the multiple element arrangements guidance noted above 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of asu on our financial position and results of operations

in april  the fasb issued asc  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments asc 
asc provides additional clarification on interim disclosures and require public companies to disclose the fair value of financial instruments whenever companies publish interim financial summary information 
the provisions for asc were effective for interim periods ending after june  with earlier adoption permitted

the adoption of asc did not have a material impact to our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued asc  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments asc 
asc provides additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
this issuance changes i the method for determining whether an other than temporary impairment exists for debt securities and for cost method investments  and ii the amount of an impairment charge to be recorded in earnings 
asc was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the company has determined that it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of its cost method investments  as quoted market prices are not available 
during  the company s investment in colibrys ltd

the aggregate carrying amount of cost method investments was million at december   and was included within other assets 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact to our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asc  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities asc  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  asc would require unvested share based payment awards containing non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid to be included in the computation of basic earnings per share according to the two class method 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our earnings per share computation 
credit and sales risks no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  however  our top five customers in total represented approximately  and  respectively of our consolidated net revenues 
the loss of any significant customers or deterioration in our relationship with either customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for the twelve months ended december   we recognized million of sales to customers in europe  million of sales to customers in asia pacific  million of sales to customers in africa  million of sales to customers in the middle east  million of sales to customers in latin american countries  and million of sales to customers in the commonwealth of independent states  or former soviet union cis 
the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended december  and  international sales comprised and  respectively  of total net revenues 
in recent years  the cis and certain latin american countries have experienced economic problems and uncertainties 
however  given the recent market downturn  more countries and areas of the world have also begun to experience economic problems and uncertainties 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world or the collectibility of our existing receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently require customers in these higher risk countries to provide their own financing and in some cases assist the customer in organizing international financing and export import credit guarantees provided by the united states government 
we do not currently extend long term credit through notes to companies in countries we consider to be inappropriate for credit risk purposes 
certain relationships and related party transactions james m 
lapeyre  jr 
is chairman of our board of directors 
he is also the chairman and a significant equity owner of laitram  llc laitram and has served as president of laitram and its predecessors since laitram is a privately owned  new orleans based manufacturer of food processing equipment and modular conveyor belts 
mr 
lapeyre and laitram together owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of february  we acquired digicourse  inc  our marine positioning products business  from laitram in and have renamed it i o marine systems  inc in connection with that acquisition  we entered into a continued services agreement with laitram under which laitram agreed to provide us certain accounting  software  manufacturing  and maintenance services 
manufacturing services consist primarily of machining of parts for our marine positioning systems 
the term of this agreement expired in september but we continue to operate under its terms 
in addition  when we have requested  the legal staff of laitram has advised us on certain intellectual property matters with regard to our marine positioning systems 
under a lease of commercial property dated february   between lapeyre properties llc an affiliate of laitram and ion  we agreed to lease certain office and warehouse space from lapeyre properties until january during  we paid laitram a total of approximately million  which consisted of approximately million for manufacturing services  million for rent and other pass through third party facilities charges  and million for other services 
for the and fiscal years  we paid laitram a total of approximately million and million for these services 
in the opinion of our management  the terms of these services are fair and reasonable and as favorable to us as those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties at the time of their performance 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as a result  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers  suppliers  and other parties under which we may agree to indemnify the other party to such arrangement from certain losses it incurs relating to our products or services or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract 
some of these indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss limitations 
historically  payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include risks related to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in our common stock price 
interest rate risk 
on december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  net of a million non cash debt discount associated with our million in convertible notes  and including capital lease obligations 
of that indebtedness  approximately million accrues interest under rates that fluctuate based upon market rates plus an applicable margin 
both the million in term loan indebtedness and the million  excluding the non cash debt discount  in total revolving credit indebtedness outstanding under the amended credit facility accrued interest using libor based interest rate of per annum 
the average effective interest rate for the quarter ended december  under the libor based rates for both the term loan indebtedness and the revolving credit loans were 
each basis point increase in the interest rate would have the effect of increasing the annual amount of interest to be paid by approximately million 
the fair market value of our outstanding notes payable and long term debt was determined to be million at december  approximately million of our revolving credit borrowings and million of our term loan were re negotiated in october additionally  the debt under the icon loan agreements totaling million at december  was negotiated in june as a result  a majority of our principal debt facilities were re negotiated within the fourth quarter of using current market rates 
also  a majority of our indebtedness is variable rate  which approximates fair value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our operations are conducted in various countries around the world  and we receive revenue from these operations in a number of different currencies with the most significant of our international operations using canadian dollars cad 
as such  our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our functional currency  or the functional currency of many of our subsidiaries  which is not necessarily the us dollar 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including united kingdom  canada  the netherlands  china  venezuela  india  russia  the united arab emirates  and other countries 
our financial results may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our consolidated balance sheet at december  reflected approximately million of net working capital related to our foreign subsidiaries 
a majority of our foreign net working capital is within canada and the united kingdom 
the subsidiaries in those countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in canadian dollars cdn and pounds sterling gbp  respectively 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in cdn or gbp  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
fair value of the warrant 
the warrant issued to bgp related to our proposed joint venture  which included bgp arranging for the bank of china to join as a new lender to our amended credit facility  is required to be accounted for at its fair value 
the value of the warrant was determined using a black scholes model 
the key input for the black scholes model is the current market price of our common stock  the yield on our common stock dividend payments  risk free interest rates  the expected term march  and our stock s historical and implied volatility 
holding all other inputs constant  a increase or decrease in our common stock price would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability of million and million  respectively
