overview heartland express  inc is a short to medium haul truckload carrier 
the company transports freight for major shippers and generally earns revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered 
the company operates eleven regional operating divisions that provide regional dry van truckload services from nine regional operating centers in addition to its corporate headquarters during the company s eleven regional operating divisions  not including operations at the corporate headquarters  accounted for and of the and operating revenues 
the company s newest regional operating center near dallas  texas opened in early january the company takes pride in the quality of the service that it provides to its customers 
the keys to maintaining a high level of service are the availability of late model equipment and experienced drivers 
operating efficiencies and cost controls are achieved through equipment utilization  operating a fleet of late model equipment  maintaining an industry leading driver to non driver employee ratio  and the effective management of fixed and variable operating costs 
the industry experienced soft freight demand in  which worsened throughout creating downward pressures on freight rates and fuel surcharge rates 
the current freight demand experienced by the company is expected to continue into we believe freight volumes have stabilized but are unable at this time to project when the company would expect freight volumes to improve 
the industry continues to fight excess capacity in the market place  while declining freight volumes continue to place downward pressure on freight rates 
as fuel prices soared to historical highs during  containment of fuel cost became a top priority of management 
the company continued to address fuel initiative strategies to effectively manage fuel costs during these initiatives included strategic fueling of our trucks whether it be terminal fuel or over the road fuel  reduction of tractor idle time  controlling out of route miles  increased fuel economy of our newer tractors acquired in and over previous model tractors  and fuel hedging 
fuel expense was reduced approximately million for compared to mainly due to the reduced price of fuel and lower volumes due to lower miles driven  as well as the efforts of the initiatives previously mentioned 
although the company experienced fairly stable fuel costs throughout in comparison to  company management continues to encourage these initiatives 
at december   the company s tractor fleet had an average age of years while the trailer fleet had an average age of years 
the company continues to focus on growing internally by providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in the company s regional operating areas 
in addition to the development of its regional operating centers  the company has made five acquisitions since we believe our commitment to quality service allowed the company to hold its freight rates relatively stable throughout in comparison to our competitors 
future growth is dependent upon several factors including the level of economic growth and the related customer demand  the available capacity in the trucking industry  potential of acquisition opportunities  and the availability of experienced drivers

the company used million in net investing cash flows  mainly due to the purchase of new revenue equipment  and million in financing activities  which was made up of million in stock repurchases and million in dividend payments during as a result  the company decreased cash and cash equivalents million during the year ended december  the company ended the year with cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million and a debt free balance sheet 
the continued decline in the demand for freight services and an overcapacity of trucks in the industry has negatively impacted the operating results of the soft freight demand has resulted in downward pressures on freight and fuel surcharge rates and has resulted in lower equipment utilization and an average smaller fleet size compared to fuel expense during was the result of two distinct periods of pricing 
from january to july  the company experienced rising fuel prices that reached a peak during early july from early july to december  the company experienced declining fuel prices 
fuel prices remained relatively stable throughout us average doe prices for were compared to approximately per gallon the first part of january  which rose to approximately in early july and fell to approximately by the end of fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenues and fuel stabilization paid to owner operators and favorable fuel hedge settlements  was approximately and of our operating expenses  net of gains on sales of property and equipment for the years ended december  and therefore increases and decreases in fuel prices  continue to have the potential for materially affecting our financial results

results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to total operating revenue for the years indicated 
year ended december  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and benefits rent and purchased transportation fuel operations and maintenance operating taxes and license insurance and claims communications and utilities depreciation other operating expenses gain on disposal of property and equipment operating income interest income income before income taxes income taxes net income 
table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating revenue decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the decrease in revenue was the result of a decrease in line haul revenue and other revenues of approximately million and a million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue from million in to million in fuel surcharge revenues represent fuel costs passed on to customers based on customer specific fuel charge recovery rates and billed loaded miles 
fuel surcharge revenues declined mostly as a result of a decrease in average doe diesel fuel prices for compared to with additional decreases due to fewer miles driven during line haul revenues declined by million based on fewer miles driven million and decreases in average freight rates million 
other revenues decreased million as these other fees are directly associated with loads and miles driven 
fewer miles during resulted from a combination of less demand for shipping services as shippers were shipping lower quantities of goods during based on overall economic conditions  continued overcapacity within the industry  and significant pricing pressure within the industry 
salaries  wages  and benefits decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the decrease was the result of a million decrease in driver wages  a million decrease in office and shop wages  a million decrease in workers compensation and a million decrease in health insurance and other benefits and payroll taxes 
for and  employee drivers accounted for and independent contractors for of the total fleet miles 
company driver wages decrease was consistent with the decrease in line haul revenues detailed above due to freight volume declines in compared to with a slight decrease in total company mileage rates paid due to a slight decrease in mileage rates paid to new drivers hired subsequent to may office and shop personnel wages decreased primarily as a result of fewer non driver personnel during compared to workers compensation expense decreased million due to an overall decrease in frequency and severity of claims incurred 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the compared period of of the total decrease  million related to a decrease in amounts paid to owner operators and in other rental charges 
the decrease in amounts paid to owner operators is attributable to fewer miles driven million and a decrease in amounts paid under the company s fuel stability program due to lower average fuel costs during compared to million 
fuel decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the decrease is the net result of decreased fuel prices million and a decrease in miles driven and idle reduction initiatives million 
the company s fuel cost per company owned tractor mile decreased in compared to the same period of on a decrease in cost per gallon compared to fuel cost per mile  net of fuel surcharge  decreased in compared to the same period of the department of energy doe average diesel price per gallon for was per gallon compared to the same period of of per gallon 
fuel expense during was net of the benefit of the company s fuel hedging efforts based on gains of million for settlements received on fuel derivative contracts 
there were no hedging contracts during insurance and claims decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of due to a decrease in the frequency and severity of larger auto liability related claims during compared to as a result of an increase in our retention limits for auto liability claims from million to million  our insurance and claims expense could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results to the extent we incur claims that exceed million 
depreciation increased million  to million during from million in the increase is mainly attributable to an increase in tractor purchases during the third and fourth quarters of and as part of the company s latest fleet upgrade program 
as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method  depreciation expense declines in years subsequent to the first year after initial purchase 
tractors purchased prior to january  are depreciated using the declining balance method 
tractors purchased subsequent to january  are being depreciated using the declining balance method  which increased tractor depreciation million during when compared to the depreciation method used in the prior year 
the company changed its estimate of depreciation expense on tractors acquired subsequent to january  to better reflect the estimated trade value of the tractors at the estimated trade date 
the change was the result of the cost of new tractors  current tractor trade values and the expected values in the trade market for the foreseeable future 
during the second half of and the company has placed in service  new tractors which have a higher base cost than previous tractors purchased approximately and are in the first year of depreciation 
tractor depreciation increased million to million in from million the increase in tractor depreciation was offset by a decrease of million in trailer depreciation in compared to the decrease in trailer depreciation was the direct result of a portion of our trailer fleet being depreciated to the estimated salvage value and accordingly there is not any further depreciation expense on these respective trailers 
all other depreciation increased million 
other operating expenses decreased million  to million during from million in other operating expenses consists of costs incurred for advertising expense  freight handling  highway tolls  driver recruiting expenses  and administrative costs which have decreased mainly due to lower load counts  driver miles and less driver recruiting 

table of contents gain on the disposal of property and equipment increased million  to million during from million in the gain increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the number of tractors traded or sold during the period compared to the period 
interest income decreased million  to million in from million in the decrease is mainly the result of lower average returns due to the decline in interest rates applicable to short and long term investments which the company saw throughout  and continued declines into as well as lower average balances of cash and investments due to uses of cash for investing and finance purposes 
the company s effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to an increased favorable income tax expense adjustment during compared to the same period of as a result of the roll off of certain state tax contingencies due to the application of the authoritative guidance on uncertain income tax positions coupled with less taxable income during the current year compared to the same period of along with additional state income tax benefits recorded in from certain state tax return filing positions 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during the year ended december  compared with during the year ended december  net income decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million during the compared period as a result of the net effects discussed above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the increase in revenue was the net effect of a million increase in fuel surcharge revenue from million in to million in offset by a decrease in freight revenues of million from million in to million in freight revenues declined million on the net result of fewer miles driven million and a slight increase in rates due to general changes in customer mix million 
miles driven year over year was directly related to soft freight demand experienced during compared to the increase in fuel surcharge revenues was the direct result of higher average fuel prices throughout compared to fuel surcharge revenues represent fuel costs passed on to customers based on customer specific fuel surcharge recovery rates and billed loaded miles 
salaries  wages  and benefits increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the increase was the net result of a million decrease in driver wages  a million increase in office and shop wages  a million increase in workers compensation and a million increase increase in health insurance  and a decrease of other benefits and payroll taxes of million 
during the year ended december   employee drivers accounted for and independent contractors for of the total fleet miles  compared with and  respectively  for company driver wages decrease was consistent with the decrease in freight revenues detailed above due to freight volume declines in compared to with no mileage rate changes during office and shop personnel increased as a result of a higher number of employees in certain strategic areas as well as annual wage increases 
workers compensation expense increased million due to an overall increase in frequency and severity of claims incurred 
health insurance expense increased million due mainly to an increase in average monthly claims 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the compared period of of the total decrease  million related to a decrease in miles driven by independent contractors  offset by an increase of million in fuel stabilization payments due to higher average fuel costs during compared to the remaining million decrease was due to other rents which included rents on office space prior to the company moving into a company owned terminal location in phoenix and corporate headquarters in north liberty during may and july  respectively 
fuel increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the increase is the net result of an average increase in fuel cost per gallon of per gallon from an average of per gallon in to an average of per gallon in offset by an approximate decrease in total gallons purchased 
the decrease in gallons purchased during compared to was the result of fewer company driver miles due to weaker freight demand and an increase in fuel economy 
the company s average miles per gallon increased compared to and out of route miles decreased which the company attributes to the efforts to manage idle time and out of route costs during the year 
operations and maintenance increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the compared period due to an increase in preventative maintenance and parts replacement related to an increase in the average age of the tractor fleet  costs associated with trade truck campaign and higher than usual operations and maintenance costs during the early months of based on more adverse weather conditions 

table of contents insurance and claims increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of due to an increase in the frequency and severity of larger claims during compared to depreciation decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the compared period 
tractors accounted for million of the total decrease 
the tractor decrease is attributable to an overall decrease in average depreciation per tractor compared to mainly as a result of the average age of the tractor fleet 
this decrease was due to timing of new tractor purchases 
new tractors with higher depreciable bases were not purchased and placed in service until the third and fourth quarters of  as such older tractor equipment was depreciated for the majority of as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method  depreciation expense declines in years subsequent to the first year after initial purchase and continue to decline with the age of the fleet 
the decrease in tractor depreciation was offset by higher depreciation on buildings  furniture and fixtures  and land improvements due to a full year of depreciation on our new corporate headquarters facilities opened in july and new phoenix terminal opened in june 
other operating expenses were essentially unchanged during the year ended december  compared to the same period of other operating expenses consists of costs incurred for advertising expense  freight handling  highway tolls  driver recruiting expenses  and administrative costs 
gain on the disposal of property and equipment decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of during the company started a tractor fleet upgrade campaign and as of december   the company was approximately through this campaign 
as such  approximately million of the gains related to gains on traded tractors 
during the company sold real estate in columbus  ohio  coralville  iowa  and dubois  pennsylvania recording total gains of approximately million with the remaining gains attributable to revenue equipment sales and trades 
the proceeds received from these sales were used in the financing of the new corporate headquarters 
a tractor fleet upgrade was completed in december and therefore tractor trades in were less than compared to the company does not expect gains on a per tractor basis to be as high during future years as it has been for the past several years as the company will have substantially disposed of all tractors with a lower initial recorded basis due to purchases of tractors prior to adoption of sfas interest income decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of as the net result of a decrease in average cash  cash equivalents  and investments year over year due primarily to the payment of the special dividend in may million 
offsetting the decrease in average interest bearing balances was an improved average rate of return on cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the majority of interest income continues to be associated with the company s investment in student loan auction rate securities 
the current rate of return on these investments continues to exceed the rates of return on similar aaa rated  non taxable securities 
the company s effective tax rate was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and this decrease is primarily attributable to a net reduction of tax accruals for uncertain tax positions as required under authoritative accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions 
during the company s uncertain tax position adjustment was a net reduction to tax expense of million 
this decrease relates to the reduction of the accrual for uncertain tax positions and associated accrued penalties and interest due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during the year ended december  compared with during the year ended december  net income decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million during the compared period as a result of the net effects discussed above 
inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  inflation has been fairly modest with its impacts mostly related to revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology  epa mandated new engine emission requirements on tractor engines manufactured after january  and january   and driver comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
during the company experienced an increase in tractor prices associated with the latest engine emission requirements  compared to tractor prices associated with the last fleet upgrade with pre january tractor engines 
the company currently anticipates the cost of tractors with january engine requirements to increase as much as beyond tractor pricing paid on tractors with pre january engine technology 
because of freight rate pressure seen throughout and due to overcapacity in the industry and the economic recession  the company was unable to offset these increases in tractor prices through increased freight rates 

table of contents in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
fuel prices for through and were between per gallon and per gallon 
during and average fuel prices fluctuated between per gallon and per gallon 
these significant fluctuations in fuel prices increase our cost of operations as the company is unable to pass through all increases in fuel prices 
competitive conditions in the transportation industry during and  resulting from lower demand for transportation services  has and will continue to affect the company s ability to obtain rate increases or fuel surcharges until there is improvement in the demand for transportation services 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operations  which was the case during and with the purchase of  new tractors and new trailers that were acquired during the third and fourth quarters of and throughout as of december  the latest purchase commitment for tractors was fulfilled and there were no other purchase commitments for revenue equipment 
upon the completion of the current fleet upgrade program the average age of the company s tractor fleet is years 
the company also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors  who provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses 
the company s primary source of liquidity for was net cash provided by operating activities of million compared to million in this was primarily a result of net income excluding non cash depreciation  changes in deferred taxes  and gains on disposal of equipment being approximately million higher in compared to offset by a decrease in cash flow generated by operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
the net decrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities for compared to the same period of was mainly attributable to timing of trade receivables  trade accounts payable and accrued expense items accrued wages and insurance reserves  and income tax accrual reductions 
the reductions in accrued income taxes were mainly due to uncertain tax position accrual changes and income taxes paid compared to actual liabilities 
cash flow from operating activities was of operating revenues in compared with in cash flows used for investing purposes increased for compared to the same period of the increase of investing cash outflows was mainly the net result of capital expenditure increases of million offset by a change of million in inflows of partial auction rate security ars investment calls 
the additional change was related to a decrease in proceeds from sale of equipment and changes in other assets of approximately million 
capital expenditures for property and equipment  net of trade ins  totaled million for compared to million during due mainly to the company s fleet upgrade program that began in the third quarter of and continued throughout the company received million in cash during related to partial calls of ars compared to million net receipts from ars calls during  net of purchases prior to auction failures in february the company received an additional million from ars partial calls subsequent to december the company paid million in dividends during compared to cash dividends of million paid the dividends declared in the fourth quarter and was paid in the fourth quarter of and  respectively  where as the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of was paid in the first quarter of in september   the board of directors of the company authorized a program to repurchase million shares  adjusted for stock splits  of the company s common stock in open market or negotiated transactions using available cash and cash equivalents 
the authorization to repurchase remains open at december  and has no expiration date 
during  approximately million shares of the company s common stock were repurchased for approximately million at approximately per share 
in  million shares were repurchased for million at approximately 
all shares were retired after purchase 
the authorization to repurchase remains open at december  and has no expiration date 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
approximately million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the board of director s approval 
the company paid income taxes  net of refunds  of million in which was million lower than income taxes paid during the same period in of million 
the decrease is mainly driven by lower estimated federal income tax payments based on expected taxable income for the year ending december   bonus depreciation allowed on new tractor purchases  and related lower estimated state income taxes 
management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current and projected needs 
management believes the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term which are expected to be funded from cash flows provided by operations and from existing cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the company s balance sheet remains debt free 
the company ended with million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  a decrease of million from december  this decrease was primarily attributable to stock repurchases and purchases of equipment totaling million as discussed above  net of cash flows provided by operating activities and cash received on partial calls of ars investments 

table of contents as of december   all of the company s auction rate student loan bonds were associated with unsuccessful auctions 
to date  there have been no instances of delinquencies or non payment of applicable interest from the issuers and all partial calls of securities by the issuers have been at par value plus accrued interest 
since the first auction failures in february the company has received approximately million of calls from issuers  at par  plus accrued interest at the time of the call 
this includes million received in january which has been classified as short term investments as of december  accrued interest income is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company estimates the fair value of the auction rate securities applying the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which establishes fair value as an estimate of what the company could sell the investments for in an orderly transaction with a third party as of each measurement date 
this guidance was adopted effective january  it is not the intent of the company to sell such securities at discounted pricing 
the authoritative guidance established a three level fair value hierarchy with level investments deriving fair value from quoted prices in active markets and level investments deriving fair value from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market as there are no quoted prices for these investments 
until auction failures began  the fair value of these investments were calculated using level observable inputs and fair value was deemed to be equivalent to amortized cost due to the short term and regularly occurring auction process 
based on auction failures beginning in mid february and continued failures through december   there were not any observable quoted prices or other relevant inputs for identical or similar securities 
estimated fair value of all auction rate security investments as of december  and was calculated using unobservable  level inputs  due to the lack of observable market inputs specifically related to student loan auction rate securities 
the fair value of these investments as of the december  and measurement dates could not be determined with precision based on lack of observable market data and could significantly change in future measurement periods 
the estimated fair value of the underlying investments as of december  and declined below amortized cost of the investments as a result of liquidity issues in the auction rate markets 
with the assistance of the company s financial advisors  fair values of the student loan auction rate securities were estimated  on an individual investment basis  using a discounted cash flow approach to value the underlying collateral of the trust issuing the debt securities 
this approach considers the anticipated estimated outstanding average life of the underlying student loans range of two to ten years that are the collateral to the trusts  principal outstanding  expected rates of returns over the average life of the underlying student loans using forward rate curves  and payout formulas 
these underlying cash flows  by individual investment  were discounted using interest rates consistent with instruments of similar quality and duration adjusted for a lack of liquidity in the market 
the underlying factors to the cash flow models used by the company were as follows december  december  average life of underlying loans years years rate of return discount rate liquidity discount rate calculated fair values have generally increased throughout based mainly on tightening of credit spreads throughout the company obtained an understanding of assumptions in models used by third party financial institutions to estimate fair value and considered these assumptions in the company s cash flow models but did not exclusively use the fair values provided by financial institutions based on their internal modeling 
the company is aware that trading of student loan auction rate securities is occurring in secondary markets  which were considered in the company s fair value assessment 
the company has not listed any of its assets for sale on the secondary market 
as a result of the fair value measurements  the company increased the fair value of investments by approximately million  net of tax with an offsetting decrease to unrealized loss on investments  during the year ended december  the unrealized loss of million  net of tax  is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss and the company has not recognized any other than temporary impairments in the consolidated statement of income 
there were not any realized gains or losses related to these investments for the years ended december  and during the third and fourth quarters of  various financial institutions and respective regulatory authorities announced proposed settlement terms in response to various regulatory authorities alleging certain financial institutions misled investors regarding the liquidity risks associated with auction rate securities that the respective financial institutions underwrote  marketed and sold 
further  the respective regulatory authorities alleged the respective financial institutions misrepresented to customers that auction rate securities were safe  highly liquid investments that were comparable to money markets 
certain settlement agreements were finalized prior to december  approximately based on par value of our auction rate security investments were not covered by the terms of the above mentioned settlement agreements 
the focus of the initial settlements was generally towards individuals  charities  and businesses with small investment balances  generally with holdings of million and less 
as part of the general terms of the settlements  the respective financial institutions have agreed to provide their best efforts in providing liquidity to the auction rate securities market for investors not specifically covered by the terms of the respective settlements 
such liquidity solutions could be in the form of facilitating issuer redemptions  resecuritizations  or other means 
the company cannot currently project when liquidity will be obtained from these investments and plans to continue to hold such securities until the securities are called  redeemed  or resecuritized by the debt issuers 

table of contents the remaining based on par value was specifically covered by a settlement agreement which the company signed during the fourth quarter of by signing the settlement agreement  the company relinquished its rights to bring any claims against the financial institution  as well  as its right to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action 
further  the company no longer has the sole discretion and right to sell or otherwise dispose of  and or enter orders in the auction process with respect to the underlying securities 
as part of the settlement  the company obtained a put option to sell the underlying securities to the financial institution  which is exercisable during the period starting on june  through july   plus accrued interest 
should the financial institution sell or otherwise dispose of our securities the company will receive the par value of the securities plus accrued interest one business day after the transaction 
upon signing the settlement agreement  the company no longer maintained the intent and ability to hold the underlying securities for recovery of the temporary decline in fair value 
the company also acquired an asset  a put option  which is valued as a standalone financial instrument separate from the underlying securities 
there was not any significant change in the value of the put option during the year ended december  the value of these securities has been classified as short term investments per the consolidated balance sheet as of december  as the company may exercise the call provision beginning in july the company has evaluated the unrealized loss on securities other than securities covered by the settlement agreement discussed above to determine whether this decline is other than temporary 
management has concluded the decline in fair value to be temporary based on the following considerations current market activity and the lack of severity or extended decline do not warrant such action at this time 
since auction failures began in february  the company has received approximately million as the result of partial calls by issuers  including million received in january the company received par value for the amount of these calls plus accrued interest 
based on the company s financial operating results  operating cash flows and debt free balance sheet  the company has the ability and intent to hold such securities until recovery of the unrealized loss 
there have not been any significant changes in collateralization and ratings of the underlying securities since the first failed auction 
the company continues to hold of the auction rate security portfolio in senior positions of aaa or equivalent rated securities 
the company is aware of recent increases in default rates of the underlying student loans that are the assets to the trusts issuing the auction rate security debt  which management believes is due to current overall negative economic conditions 
as the underlying loans are guaranteed by the us government  defaults of the loans accelerate payment of the underlying loan to the trust 
as trusts are no longer recycling repayment money for new loans  accelerated repayment of any student loan to the underlying trust would increase cash flows of the trust which would potentially result in partial calls by the underlying trusts 
currently  there is legislative pressure to provide liquidity in student loan investments  providing liquidity to state student loan agencies  to continue to provide financial assistance to eligible students to enable higher educations as well as improve overall liquidity in the student loan auction rate market 
this has the potential to impact existing securities with underlying student loans 
all of the auction rate securities are held with financial institutions that have agreed in principle to settlement agreements with various regulatory agencies to provide liquidity 
although the principles of the respective settlement agreements focus mostly on small investors generally companies and individual investors with auction rate security assets less than million the respective settlements state the financial institutions will work with issuers and other interested parties to use their best efforts to provide liquidity solutions to companies not specifically covered by the principle terms of the respective settlements by the end of in certain settlement agreements 
the company is expecting further guidance from regulatory agencies in the future as they monitor the progress of the respective financial institutions towards this goal 
management will monitor its investments and ongoing market conditions in future periods to assess impairments considered to be other than temporary 
should estimated fair value continue to remain below cost or the fair value decrease significantly from current fair value due to credit related issues  the company may be required to record an impairment of these investments through a charge in the consolidated statement of income

contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years other purchase obligation operating lease obligations obligations for unrecognized tax benefits obligations for unrecognized tax benefits represent potential liabilities and include interest and penalties 
the company is unable to reasonably determine when these amounts will be settled 
the company recognized tax liabilities of million with a corresponding reduction to beginning retained earnings as of january  as a result of the adoption of the authoritative accounting guidance on uncertain tax positions 
the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was million as of january   the date of adoption of this guidance 
at december  and  the company had a total of million and million in gross unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
of this amount  million and million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate as of december  and unrecognized tax benefits were a net decrease of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  due mainly to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation net of additions 
this had the effect of reducing the effective state tax rate during and the total net amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was million and million at december  and and is included in income taxes payable 
net interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the twelve month period ended december  was a benefit of approximately million 
net interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the twelve month periods ended december  and was an additional tax expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate to risks associated with state income tax filing positions for the company s corporate subsidiaries 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
these changes could result from the expiration of the statute of limitations  examinations or other unforeseen circumstances 
as of december   the company did not have any ongoing examinations or outstanding litigation related to tax matters 
at this time  management s best estimate of the reasonably possible change in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits to be a decrease of approximately to million during the next twelve months mainly due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations 
the federal statute of limitations remains open for the years and forward 
tax years and forward are subject to audit by state tax authorities depending on the tax code and administrative practice of each state

management does not consider there to be significant credit risk due to government support of the underlying loans and current credit ratings 
management monitors its investments and ongoing market conditions to assess impairments considered to be other than temporary 
should estimated fair values continue to remain below cost or the fair value decrease significantly from current fair value due to credit related issues  the company may be required to record an impairment of these investments  through a charge in the consolidated statement of income 
to date  the company has not recorded any impairment of these investments in the consolidated statement of income 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period
