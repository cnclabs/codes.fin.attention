with approximately of our revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  any significant changes in currency exchange rates will likely have a significant impact on our growth in revenues  operating income and diluted earnings per share for more discussion  see item a risk factors and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sources of revenues and cash flow euronet earns revenues and income based on atm management fees  transaction fees and commissions  professional services  software licensing fees and software maintenance agreements 
each business segment s sources of revenue are described below 
eft processing segment revenue in the eft processing segment  which represented approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is derived from fees charged for transactions effected by cardholders on our proprietary network of atms  as well as fixed management fees and transaction fees we charge to banks for operating atms and processing debit and credit cards under outsourcing agreements 
through our proprietary network  we generally charge fees for four types of atm transactions i cash withdrawals  ii balance inquiries  iii transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization  and iv prepaid telecommunication recharges 
revenue in this segment is also derived from license fees  professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware 
software license fees are the fees we charge to license our proprietary application software to customers 
professional service fees consist of charges for customization  installation and consulting services to customers 
software maintenance revenue represents the ongoing fees charged for maintenance and support for customers software products 
hardware sales are derived from the sale of computer equipment necessary for the respective software solution 
prepaid processing segment revenue in the prepaid processing segment  which represented approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is primarily derived from commissions or processing fees received from telecommunications service providers for the sale and distribution of prepaid mobile airtime 
we also generate revenue from commissions earned from the distribution of other prepaid products 
due to certain provisions in our mobile phone operator agreements  the operators have the ability to reduce the overall commission paid on each top up transaction 
however  by virtue of our agreements with retailers distributors where pos terminals are located in certain markets  not all of these reductions are absorbed by us because we are able to pass a significant portion of the reductions to retailers 
accordingly  under certain retailer agreements  the effect is to reduce revenues and reduce our direct operating costs resulting in only a small impact on gross margin and operating income 
in some markets  reductions in commissions can significantly impact our results as it may not be possible  either contractually or commercially in the concerned market  to pass a reduction in commissions to the retailers 
in australia  certain retailers negotiate directly with the mobile phone operators for their own commission rates  which also limits our ability to pass through reductions in commissions 
agreements with mobile operators are important to the success of our business 
these agreements permit us to distribute prepaid mobile airtime to the mobile operators customers 
other products offered by this segment include prepaid long distance calling card plans  prepaid internet plans  prepaid debit cards  prepaid gift cards  prepaid vouchers  transport payments  lottery payments  bill payment  money transfer and prepaid content such as music and games 
money transfer segment revenue in the money transfer segment  which represents approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is primarily derived by charging a transaction fee  and retaining the difference between purchasing foreign currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
we have an origination network in place comprised of agents and company owned stores primarily in north america and europe and a worldwide network of distribution agents  consisting primarily of financial institutions in the transfer destination countries 
origination and distribution agents each earn fees for cash collection and distribution services 
these fees are recognized as direct operating costs at the time of sale 
opportunities and challenges our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on five primary areas signing new outsourced atm and pos terminal management contracts  increasing transactions processed on our network of owned and operated atms  expansion of our prepaid processing network  expansion of our money transfer and bill payment network  and development of our credit and debit card outsourcing business 
eft processing segment the continued expansion and development of our eft processing segment business will depend on various factors including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the impact of competition by banks and other atm operators and service providers in our current target markets  the demand for our atm outsourcing services in our current target markets  the ability to develop products or services to drive increases in transactions  the expansion of our various business lines in markets where we operate and in new markets  the entrance into additional card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks  the ability to obtain required licenses in markets we intend to enter or expand services  the availability of financing for expansion  the ability to efficiently install atms contracted under newly awarded outsourcing agreements  the ability to renew existing contracts at profitable rates  the ability to maintain pricing and interchange fees at current levels  the ability to expand and sign additional customers for the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business  and the continued development and implementation of our software products and their ability to interact with other leading products 
we consistently evaluate and add prospects to our list of potential atm outsource customers 
however  we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into outsourcing contracts with us 
due to the thorough internal reviews and extensive negotiations conducted by existing and prospective banking customers in choosing outsource vendors  the process of entering into or renewing outsourcing agreements can take approximately six to twelve months or longer 
the process is further complicated by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from acquisition or termination of these management contracts 
therefore  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
software products are an integral part of our product lines  and our investment in research  development  delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base 
we have been able to enter into agreements under which we contribute the right to use our software in lieu of cash as our initial capital contributions to new transaction processing joint ventures 
such contributions sometimes permit us to enter new markets without significant capital investment 
we have entered the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business and  since the beginning of  we have devoted significant resources to the development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities for this business  which involves the purchase and design of hardware and software 
merchant acquiring involves processing credit and debit card transactions that are made on pos terminals  including authorization  settlement  and processing of settlement files 
it generally involves the assumption of credit risk  as the principal amount of transactions is usually settled to merchants before settlements are received from card associations 
prepaid processing segment the continued expansion and development of the prepaid processing segment business will depend on various factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the ability to negotiate new agreements in additional markets with mobile phone operators  content providers  agent financial institutions and retailers  the ability to use existing expertise and relationships with mobile operators  content providers and retailers to our advantage  the continued use of third party providers such as ourselves to supply electronic processing solutions for prepaid content  the development of mobile phone networks in the markets in which we do business and the increase in the number of mobile phone users  the overall pace of growth in the prepaid mobile phone market  our market share of the retail distribution capacity  the ability to successfully brand our retail locations  the level of commission that is paid to the various intermediaries in the prepaid distribution chain  our ability to add new and differentiated prepaid products in addition to those offered by mobile operators  the ability to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our money transfer segment  including providing money transfer services through our prepaid locations  and the availability of financing for further expansion 
in mature markets  such as the uk  australia  germany  new zealand and spain  the conversion from scratch cards to electronic forms of distribution is either complete or nearing completion 
because of this factor  we are not likely to experience the organic increases in the number of transactions per terminal that we have experienced historically 
also in mature markets  competition among prepaid distributors results in the increase of commissions paid to retailers and increases in retailer attrition rates 
the combined impact of these factors in developed markets is a flattening of growth in the revenues and profits that we earn 
in other markets in which we operate  such as poland  germany and the us  many of the factors that may contribute to rapid growth conversion from scratch cards to electronic distribution  growth in the prepaid market  expansion of our network of retailers and access to all mobile operators products remain present 
money transfer segment the expansion and development of our money transfer business will depend on various factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the continued growth in worker migration and employment opportunities  the mitigation of economic and political factors that have had an adverse impact on money transfer volumes  such as changes in the economic sectors in which immigrants work and the developments in immigration policies in the us  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic money transfer and bill payment services among immigrant workers and the unbanked population in our markets  the ability to maintain our agent and correspondent networks  the ability to offer our products and services or develop new products and services at competitive prices to drive increases in transactions  the expansion of our services in markets where we operate and in new markets  the ability to strengthen our brands  our ability to fund working capital requirements  our ability to maintain compliance with the regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate  the ability to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with the prepaid processing segment  including providing prepaid services through ria s stores and agents worldwide  the ability to leverage our banking and merchant retailer relationships to expand money transfer corridors to europe and asia  including high growth corridors to central and eastern european countries  the availability of financing for further expansion  our ability to continue to successfully integrate ria with our other operations  and our ability to successfully expand our agent network in europe using our payment services directive license 
like other participants in the money transfer industry  as a result of downturns in certain labor markets  the current recessionary economic environment and immigration developments  the number of money transfers from the us to mexico decreased in and compared to respective prior years 
we cannot predict how long these issues will continue to affect the us market or whether other markets will experience similar issues 
corporate services  eliminations and other in addition to operating in our principal business segments described above  our corporate services  elimination and other division includes non operating activity  certain inter segment eliminations and the cost of providing corporate and other administrative services to the business segments  including share based compensation expense 
these services are not directly identifiable with our business segments 
the accounting policies of each segment are the same as those referenced in the summary of significant accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies and practices  to the consolidated financial statements 
for all segments  our continued expansion may involve additional acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services 
our ability to effectively manage our rapid growth has required us to expand our operating systems and employee base  particularly at the management level  which has added incremental operating costs 
an inability to continue to effectively manage expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
inadequate technology and resources would impair our ability to maintain current processing technology and efficiencies  as well as deliver new and innovative services to compete in the marketplace 
segment revenues and operating income loss for the years ended december   and revenues operating income loss in thousands eft processing prepaid processing money transfer total corporate services total summary our annual consolidated revenues decreased by for compared to and increased by for over the decrease was largely the result of the impact of a stronger us dollar  partly offset by growth in our business resulting from increases in transactions processed 
the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of ria envia in april along with increases in transactions processed 
for further discussion regarding acquisitions  see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
our operating income for and includes non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  as discussed in note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements 
the results for include an increase in operating income of million for a federal excise tax refund discussed in note  federal excise tax refund  to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in and and the federal excise tax refund in  our operating income increased for over and for over these increases were primarily the result of growth in transaction volumes and related revenues

impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during and through mid  the us dollar weakened compared to most of the currencies of the countries in which we operate 
in the second half of and through the first half of  the us dollar strengthened before weakening again in the second half of these fluctuations in currency exchange rates resulted in the us dollar being  on average  stronger in than in and weaker in than in because our revenues and local expenses are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earned for were negatively impacted by the stronger us dollar  while amounts we earned for and were positively impacted by the weaker us dollar 
because of changes in foreign currency exchanges rates  we estimate that our operating income was diminished by approximately compared to  while operating income benefited by approximately when compared to while the impact of the stronger us dollar generally hampered results in each segment in  the benefit for was mainly concentrated in the eft processing segment  largely due to the impact of the changes in exchange rates of the polish zloty 
to provide further perspective on the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  the following table shows the changes in values for and  relative to the us dollar  of the currencies of the countries in which we have our most significant operations 
average translation rate year ended year ended year ended increase december  december  december  decrease decrease currency percent percent australian dollar british pound euro hungarian forint indian rupee polish zloty comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment eft processing segment compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the eft processing segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change increase increase decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions atms as of december average atms revenues our revenues for decreased when compared to due to the stronger us dollar during compared to relative to most of the currencies of the countries in which we operate 
because our revenues are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earn in foreign currencies are negatively impacted by the stronger us dollar 
additionally  the decrease in the number of atms operated  which is primarily due to expiration or termination of atm services contracts discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs  limited our revenue growth 
offsetting these decreases were contract termination fees totaling million and increases in revenues primarily associated with our operations in germany  india  poland and our software and cross border merchant processing and acquiring businesses 
average monthly revenue per atm was  for  compared to  for the increase is generally the result of increased transaction fees in germany  the non recurring contract termination fees discussed above and the expiration of an atm services contract in the uk at the end of the first quarter  partly offset by the impact of the stronger us dollar 
we have recently been able to increase transaction fees in germany  but we are uncertain if we will be able to increase them further or maintain the current rates 
the uk contract involved processing services only with very little associated costs and  therefore  had lower than average revenue per atm 
revenues per transaction were for and for the decrease is primarily the result of the impact of the stronger us dollar and the growth of transactions in india and china  where revenues per transaction have been historically lower than in central and eastern europe  generally due to lower labor costs 
during  transactions on cashnet euronet s shared network in india increased when compared to our contracts in the eft processing segment tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from entry into or termination of these management contracts 
banks have historically been very deliberate in negotiating these agreements and have evaluated a wide range of matters when deciding to choose an outsource vendor 
generally  the process of negotiating a new agreement is subject to extensive management analysis and approvals and the process typically takes six to twelve months or longer 
increasing consolidation in the banking industry could make this process less predictable 
our existing contracts generally have terms of five to seven years and a number of them will expire or be up for renewal each year for the next few years 
as a result  we expect to be regularly engaged in discussions with one or more of our customer banks to either renew or restructure our atm outsourcing agreements 
during the fourth quarter and first quarter  certain customer contracts were terminated or expired  resulting in a decrease of approximately  atms 
most of the atm reductions resulted from bank customers shifting their processing to related processing subsidiaries in contemplation of selling the subsidiaries to raise capital  rather than the loss of contracts to competitors 
the reduction in the number of atms from contract terminations or expirations was partially offset during by increases in atms driven under new contracts  expansion of atms under existing contracts and the deployment of atms in markets where we operate euronet branded atms 
for contracts that we are able to renew  as was the case for certain contract renewals in prior years  we expect customers to seek rate concessions or up front payments because of the greater availability of alternative processing solutions in many of our markets now  as compared to when we entered into the contracts 
excluding the expired or terminated contracts discussed above  we were able to renew or extend most of the remaining contracts that were due to expire in while we were successful in many cases in obtaining new terms that preserve the same level of earnings arising from the agreements  we were not successful in all cases and  therefore  we expect to experience reductions in revenues in future quarters arising from the expiration or restructuring of agreements 
for the contracts that expired during the fourth quarter and first quarter  excluding substantial termination fees described above  we estimate that the impact to was a reduction in revenues of approximately million to million  resulting in reduced operating income of approximately million to million 
direct operating costs direct operating costs consist primarily of site rental fees  cash delivery costs  cash supply costs  maintenance  insurance  telecommunications and the cost of data center operations related personnel  as well as the processing centers facility related costs and other processing center related expenses 
the decrease in direct operating cost for  compared to  is attributed to the impact of the stronger us dollar and the decrease in the number of atms under operation 
gross profit gross profit  which is calculated as revenues less direct operating costs  increased to million for from million for this increase is mainly attributable to the increased transaction fees in germany  improved profitability in india  poland and our cross border merchant processing and acquiring business and the contract termination fee revenues discussed above 
partly offsetting these increases are the impact of the stronger us dollar and the loss of atm services contracts discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross margin was for compared to for the increase in gross margin is primarily due to the previously mentioned contract termination fees and gross margin improvements in germany  india and our cross border merchant processing and acquiring business 
salaries and benefits the decrease in salaries and benefits for compared to is almost entirely due to the impact of the stronger us dollar discussed above 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased to for from for selling  general and administrative the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is due primarily to the impact of the stronger us dollar 
the decrease in these expenses was also impacted by the spike in expenses in the second half of following the launch of our cross border merchant processing and acquiring business 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat at for and depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for compared to is due primarily to the impact of the stronger us dollar described above  partly offset by increased depreciation associated with our cross border merchant processing and acquiring business as well as increased deployment of owned atms in poland 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses remained flat at for and operating income operating income as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for the increases in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to the substantial contract termination fee revenues described above and the improvements in germany  india and our software and cross border merchant processing and acquiring businesses  partly offset by the impact of the stronger us dollar 
operating income per transaction was for and for software sales backlog as of december   the eft segment had a software contract backlog of approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  this backlog represents software sales based on signed contracts under which we continue to have performance milestones before the sale will be completed 
we recognize revenues on a percentage of completion method  based on certain milestone conditions  for our software solutions 
as a result  we have not recognized all the revenues associated with these sales contracts 
we cannot give assurances that the milestones under the contracts will be completed or that we will be able to recognize the related revenues within the next year 
compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the eft processing segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change increase increase decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions atms as of december average atms revenues our revenues for increased when compared to primarily due to increases in the average number of atms operated and the number of transactions processed 
these increases were attributable to many of our operations  but primarily our operations in poland  india and euronet card services greece 
additionally  during the us dollar was weaker on average than during relative to the currencies of most of the countries in which we operate 
because our revenues are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earn in foreign currencies are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
partly offsetting these improvements were decreases in revenue associated with our operations in romania due to a decrease in the per transaction fee structure with a customer that was granted in exchange for an extension of the contract term and the expiration of an atm services contract discussed in more detail in the following paragraph 
average monthly revenue per atm was  for  compared to  for and revenue per transaction was for and for the increase in revenues per atm is generally the result of the expiration of an atm services contract in the uk at the end of the first quarter that involved processing services only  with very little associated costs and  therefore  had lower than average revenue per atm 
as of december  and march   we were providing processing services for approximately  and  atms  respectively  under this contract 
partly offsetting this improvement is the addition of atms in china and india  where revenues per atm have been historically lower than central and eastern europe  generally due to lower labor costs 
direct operating costs direct operating costs consist primarily of site rental fees  cash delivery costs  cash supply costs  maintenance  insurance  telecommunications and the cost of data center operations related personnel  as well as the processing centers facility related costs and other processing center related expenses 
the increase in direct operating cost for  compared to  is attributed to the increase in the average number of atms under operation  particularly the growing number of independently deployed atms in new markets  and the launch of our cross border merchant processing and acquiring business 
throughout and into  we incurred substantial capital and operating expenditures in anticipation of entering the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business after we entered into an agreement for these services with a large petrol retailer in central europe 
the revenues recorded in after launching this business in mid were not significant  however  the cost structure was largely in place and contributed to the increase in direct operating costs and certain other expenses discussed below 
additionally  and include losses of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily in poland and hungary  as a result of certain fraudulent transactions by card holders on our network 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for from million for this increase is mainly attributable to the increase in revenues discussed above 
gross margin was for compared to for the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the impact of the expiration of the atm services contract in the uk and launching the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business 
salaries and benefits the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to was due to staffing costs to support growth in the average number of atms managed and transactions processed and for new products  such as pos  card processing and cross border merchant processing and acquiring 
salaries and benefits also increased as a result of general merit increases awarded to employees 
as a percentage of revenue  however  these costs decreased slightly to of revenues for compared to for selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for include a million arbitration loss awarded by a tribunal in budapest  hungary arising from a claim by a former cash supply contractor in central europe 
excluding the impact of the arbitration loss  as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expenses increased to in compared to in this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is due primarily to the launch of our cross border merchant processing and acquiring business that occurred during the second quarter depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for compared to is due primarily to additional atms in poland and india and additional equipment and software for our processing centers in hungary and china 
as a percentage of revenue  these expenses remained flat at for both and operating income the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increases in revenues described above 
additionally  operating income was affected by several unique items in and operating income was reduced million by the arbitration loss described above  operating income was million greater in compared to due to the decrease in fraudulent card losses described above  operating income was million less in compared to due to the expiration of the atm services contract in the uk and the launching of the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business described above 
excluding the impacts of these items  operating income increased in compared to  was as a percentage of revenues for compared to for and was per transaction for both and prepaid processing segment compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the prepaid processing segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change increase increase decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment   n m depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss    n m transactions processed millions n m not meaningful 
revenues the decrease in revenues for compared to was generally attributable to the impact of the stronger us dollar and mobile operator commission rate decreases in certain markets  largely offset by the increase in total transactions processed across most of our prepaid processing segment operations  particularly australia  germany and the us in certain more mature markets  such as the uk  new zealand and spain  our revenue growth has slowed substantially and  in some cases  revenues have decreased because conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up is substantially complete and certain mobile operators and retailers are driving competitive reductions in pricing and margins 
we expect most of our future revenue growth to be derived from i additional products sold over the base of prepaid processing terminals  ii developing markets or markets in which there is organic growth in the prepaid sector overall  iii continued conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up in less mature markets  and iv acquisitions  if available 
revenues per transaction decreased to for from for due primarily to the impact of the stronger us dollar and mobile operator commission rate decreases in certain markets 
direct operating costs direct operating costs in the prepaid processing segment include the commissions we pay to retail merchants for the distribution and sale of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products  as well as expenses required to operate pos terminals 
these expenditures generally fluctuate directly with revenues and processed transactions 
the decrease in direct operating costs is generally attributable to the impact of the stronger us dollar  partly offset by the increase in total transactions processed 
additionally  almost of the decrease in mobile operator commission revenues discussed above was passed on to retail merchants resulting in lower commission costs 
gross profit gross profit was million for compared to million for gross margin remained flat at for both and and gross profit per transaction was for compared to for most of the reduction in gross profit per transaction is due to the impact of the stronger us dollar 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits were flat for compared to as a result of the impact of the stronger us dollar largely offsetting increased costs to support development in new and growing markets 
as a percentage of revenues  salaries and benefits increased slightly to for from for selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is primarily due to additional overhead to support development in new and growing markets and increased allowance for bad debts and other balance sheet reconciliation issues in one of our operating units  partly offset by the impact of the stronger us dollar 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for from for goodwill impairment in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the goodwill of the spanish prepaid business 
see the discussion in compared to below for more information about this charge 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles and the depreciation of pos terminals we install in retail stores 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization for compared to is almost entirely due to the impact of the stronger us dollar 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expense decreased slightly to for from for operating income loss the increase in operating income for compared to is mainly due to the goodwill impairment charge in excluding the goodwill impairment charge  operating income as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for the increase is primarily due to the growth in transactions processed

revenues the increase in revenues for compared to was generally attributable to the increase in total transactions processed across most of our prepaid processing segment operations  particularly australia  germany and poland 
revenues per transaction decreased to for from for due primarily to the growth in revenues and transactions recorded by our atx subsidiary  which is euronet owned 
in accordance with us gaap  atx is consolidated and the amounts in our financial statements and in the table above reflect of atx s results 
results attributable to the minority owner are reflected in the noncontrolling interests line of our consolidated statements of operations 
atx provides only transaction processing services without direct costs and other operating costs generally associated with installing and managing terminals  therefore  the revenue we recognize from these transactions is a fraction of that recognized on average transactions  but with very low cost 
partly offsetting this decrease was the growth in both volumes and revenues in australia which generally has higher revenues per transaction  but also pays higher commission rates to retailers  than our other prepaid processing subsidiaries 
direct operating costs the increase in direct operating costs is generally attributable to the increase in total transactions processed 
gross profit gross profit was million for compared to million for gross margin increased to for compared to for and gross profit per transaction was for compared to for most of the reduction in gross profit per transaction is due to the growth of revenues and transactions at our atx subsidiary and the general maturity of the prepaid mobile airtime business in many of our markets 
salaries and benefits while salaries and benefits increased for compared to to support development in new and growing markets  as a percentage of revenue  they decreased slightly to for from for selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is the result of additional overhead to support development in new and growing markets 
as a percentage of revenues  these selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat at for both and goodwill impairment in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the goodwill of the spanish prepaid business 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincided in with severe disruptions in the credit markets and the macroeconomic business climate 
these events caused credit  currency and stock markets to plummet in the second half of and adversely impacted corporate valuations across most industries  all of which contributed to a significant decline in our stock price during this period 
an important component of the goodwill impairment testing was the reconciliation of a company s equity to its market capitalization 
during the fourth quarter and into  our total market capitalization was less than the recorded value of the company s equity by an amount approaching of recorded equity  creating a strong indicator of impairment for our goodwill balance 
because of these macroeconomic conditions  after incorporating assumptions that we or another purchaser would likely make into the company s business outlook and projections for the spanish prepaid business  we determined that the resulting valuations were not sufficient to support the recorded value of our investment 
specifically  growth in the prepaid mobile phone business in spain had been slower than expected and commission pressure from mobile operators  as well as intense competition from other prepaid processors  had reduced profitability 
see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this charge 
federal excise tax refund during  the internal revenue service irs announced that internal revenue code section relating to communications excise tax will no longer apply to  among other services  prepaid mobile airtime services such as those offered by the prepaid processing segment s us operations 
additionally  companies that paid this excise tax during the period beginning on march  and ending on july   were entitled to a credit or refund of amounts paid in conjunction with the filing of federal income tax returns 
during  million was recorded for amounts paid during this period as a reduction to operating expenses of the prepaid processing segment 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization for compared to reflects additional pos terminals installed as the business has grown 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to for from for operating income loss the decrease in operating income for compared to is mainly due to the goodwill impairment charge in and the benefit of the federal excise tax refund in excluding the goodwill impairment charge and the benefit of the federal excise tax refund  operating income as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for the increase is due to the growth in revenues and transactions processed and the impact of leveraging operating costs 
also excluding the goodwill impairment charge and the federal excise tax refund  operating income per transaction remained flat at for and money transfer segment compared to the following table presents the actual results of operations for the years ended december  and for the money transfer segment

for  of our money transfers were initiated in the us  in europe and in other countries 
we expect that the us will continue to represent our highest volume market  however  significant future growth is expected to be derived from non us initiated sources 
the increase in revenues for compared to is primarily due to a increase in the number of transactions processed for compared to  mostly offset by the impact of the stronger us dollar 
for  money transfers to mexico  which represented of total money transfers  decreased by  while transfers to all other countries increased when compared to the prior year primarily due to the expansion of our operations 
the decline in transfers to mexico was largely the result of downturns in certain labor markets and other economic factors impacting the us market as well as immigration developments in the us these issues have also resulted in certain competitors lowering transaction fees and foreign currency exchange spreads in an attempt to limit the impact on money transfer volumes 
we have generally maintained our pricing structure in response to these developments 
direct operating costs direct operating costs in the money transfer segment primarily represent commissions paid to agents that originate money transfers on our behalf and distribution agents that disburse funds to the customers destination beneficiary  together with less significant costs  such as telecommunication and bank fees to collect money from originating agents 
the decrease in direct operating costs in compared to is due to the impact of the stronger us dollar  partly offset by the growth in transactions processed 
gross profit gross profit was million for compared to gross profit of million for this improvement is primarily due to the growth in money transfer transactions  partly offset by the impact of the stronger us dollar related to money transfers originated outside the us as discussed above  certain competitors have been lowering transaction fees and foreign currency exchange spreads in the us market as a result of the economic factors and immigration developments impacting the us market 
we have generally maintained our pricing structure in response to these developments 
we cannot predict how long these issues will continue to affect the us market or whether other markets will experience similar issues  and we cannot predict whether we will change our pricing strategy over the short or long term in order to protect or increase market share 
gross margin was for compared to for the improvement primarily reflects the strong growth in transaction volume in our higher margin non us locations 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits include salaries and commissions paid to employees  the cost of providing employee benefits  amounts paid to contract workers and accruals for incentive compensation 
the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to is primarily due to the increased expenditures we incurred to support expansion or our operations  primarily internationally  partly offset by the impact of the stronger us dollar

as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for from in goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to certain goodwill and intangible assets of the ria money transfer business 
this charge was an estimate based on the assessment performed up to the filing date of our annual report on form k 
we completed the assessment in the first quarter of and recorded an additional million non cash impairment charge in the first quarter of see the discussion in compared to below for more information about these charges 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles and also includes depreciation of money transfer terminals  computers and software  leasehold improvements and office equipment 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for compared to is primarily due to additional computer equipment in our customer service centers and increased leasehold improvements  office equipment and computer equipment for expansion of our company stores along with greater acquisition related amortization  partly offset by the impact of the stronger us dollar 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to for from for operating income loss the increase in operating income for compared to is mainly due to the larger goodwill and acquired intangible impairment charge in compared to excluding these charges from both years  operating income decreased in compared to  which is the result of increased costs to expand internationally  increased professional fees and the negative impact of the stronger us dollar  partly offset by the growth in transactions processed  mainly those originated in non us locations 
additionally  revenues and operating income included approximately million in benefit from the favorable management of foreign exchange spreads that did not recur in compared to the money transfer segment was established during april with the acquisition of ria  which is more fully described in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

comparison of pro forma operating results during  we combined our previous money transfer business with ria and incurred total exit costs of million 
these costs represented the accelerated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  software and leasehold improvements that were disposed of during  the write off of marketing materials and trademarks that have been discontinued or will not be used  the write off of accounts receivable from agents that did not meet ria s credit requirements  and severance and retention payments made to certain employees 
these exit costs are not included in pro forma operating expenses in the above table 
revenues revenue per transaction was for compared to pro forma revenue per transaction of for for  of our money transfers were initiated in the us  in europe and in other countries  such as canada and australia 
for  of our money transfers were initiated in the us  in europe and in other countries 
the increase in revenues for compared to pro forma revenues for is primarily due to an increase in the number of transactions processed for compared to for  money transfers to mexico  which represented of total money transfers  decreased by  while transfers to all other countries increased when compared to the prior year due to the expansion of our operations and continued growth in immigrant worker populations in countries other than the us the decline in transfers to mexico was largely the result of immigration issues  downturns in certain labor markets and the economic crisis that began in direct operating costs while direct operating costs generally increase or decrease by a similar percentage as transactions  growth in transactions has outpaced the growth in direct costs in due to a greater growth rate for company owned stores than for agents 
gross profit gross profit was million for compared to pro forma gross profit of million for this improvement is primarily due to the growth in money transfer transactions originated in non us locations  discussed above  along with favorable management of foreign currency exchange rate spreads 
gross margin was for compared to pro forma gross margin of for the improvement primarily reflects the strong growth in transaction volume in our more profitable non us locations 
salaries and benefits the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to pro forma salaries and benefits for is primarily due to merit increases and additional costs to support our global expansion efforts  primarily the opening of company owned stores in germany  france  spain and the us selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for is primarily to support our global expansion efforts 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to certain goodwill and intangible assets of the ria money transfer business 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincided in with severe disruptions in the credit markets and the macroeconomic business climate 
these events caused credit  currency and stock markets to plummet in the second half of and adversely impacted corporate valuations across most industries  all of which contributed to a significant decline in our stock price 
an important component of the goodwill impairment testing was the reconciliation of a company s equity to its market capitalization 
during the fourth quarter and into  our total market capitalization was less than the recorded value of the company s equity by an amount approaching of recorded equity  creating a strong indicator of impairment for our goodwill balance 
because of these macroeconomic conditions  after incorporating assumptions that we or another purchaser would likely make into the business outlook and projections for the money transfer segment  we determined that the resulting valuations were not sufficient to support the recorded value of our investment 
specifically  we experienced reductions in volumes for money transfers between the us and mexico  among other corridors  that were initially expected to continue expanding 
see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this charge 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization for compared to pro forma depreciation and amortization for is primarily due to additional computer equipment in our customer service centers and increased leasehold improvements  office equipment and computer equipment for expansion of our company owned stores 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization was relatively flat at for compared to pro forma depreciation and amortization of for operating income loss the decrease in operating income for compared to pro forma operating income for is due to the goodwill and acquired intangible impairment charge in excluding this charge  operating income increased in compared to pro forma operating income for which is the result of increased revenues and gross profit as discussed in more detail above  partly offset by additional costs incurred to support our global expansion efforts 
additionally  revenues and operating income included approximately million in benefit from the favorable management of foreign exchange currency spreads as the result of unique circumstances 
corporate services the components of corporate services operating expenses for  and were as follows year over year change increase year ended december  decrease increase dollar amounts in thousands percent percent salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating expenses for corporate services decreased by for and increased by for compared to the respective prior year 
the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to is primarily the result of greater incentive compensation recorded in than in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to professional fees and settlement costs of million associated with our efforts to acquire moneygram  partly offset by increased cost for professional fees for legal and acquisition related expenses during the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization is the result of increased amortization related to an enterprise wide desk top license 
the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to is primarily the result of severance costs related to certain senior level positions and increased share based compensation related to awards made to new employees  including those in the money transfer segment 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to million in professional fees and settlement costs associated with our efforts to acquire moneygram 
the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization is the result of amortization associated with the third quarter purchase of an enterprise wide desk top license 
other income expense year over year change increase increase year ended december  decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands percent percent interest income interest expense income from unconsolidated affiliates gain on sale of impairment loss on investment securities   n m n m gain loss on early retirement of debt  n m n m foreign currency exchange gain loss  net    n m n m total other expense  net    n m n m n m not meaningful 
interest income the decreases in interest income for from and for from are primarily due to a decline in short term interest rates and a decrease in average cash balances on hand during the respective years 
interest income for included million for interest related to a federal excise tax refund 
increasing average cash deposits held in our trust accounts related to the administration of customer collections and vendor remittance activities of the prepaid processing segment have slowed the decline in interest income as the segment s operations have grown 
short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels at the beginning of and if rates continue to be near these levels  we expect interest income earned on our invested balances for will remain low as a result 
interest expense the decreases in interest expense for from and for from are primarily due to the repurchases of convertible debentures in late and early along with lower interest rates paid on floating rate debt 
during  we also repaid million on our term loan and significantly reduced borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
we generally borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility several times each month to fund the correspondent network in advance of collecting remittance amounts from the agency network 
these borrowings are repaid over a very short period of time  generally within a few days 
similar to the impact on interest income  due to the recent low levels of short term interest rates  we expect that interest paid on our floating rate borrowings for will remain low if short term interest rates remain near their current levels 
income from unconsolidated affiliates income from unconsolidated affiliates mainly represents the equity in income of our equity investment in epay malaysia and our investment in euronet middle east  an eft processing segment joint venture in bahrain 
the increases in income for from and for from are the result of increased profitability of both affiliates 
income for includes the million gain recognized from the sale of our interest in cashnet telecommunications egypt sae cashnet 
gain on sale of impairment loss on investment securities during  we sold our shares of moneygram stock  recognizing a million gain 
the gain resulted from the increase in the share price after the million impairment loss recorded in due to the other than temporary decline in value of our investment in moneygram 
gain loss on early retirement of debt during and  we repurchased in privately negotiated transactions million and million  respectively  in principal amount of the convertible debentures due loss on early retirement of debt of million for and the gain of million for represent the difference in the amounts paid for the convertible debentures compared to their carrying amounts  along with the pro rata write off of deferred financing costs associated with the portions of the term loan that were prepaid during and we expect to continue to prepay amounts outstanding under the term loan through available cash flows 
accordingly  we would recognize losses on early retirement of debt for the pro rata portion of unamortized deferred financing costs 
foreign currency exchange gain loss  net assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of each of our subsidiaries give rise to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
exchange gains and losses that result from re measurement of these assets and liabilities are recorded in determining net income 
the majority of our foreign currency gains or losses are due to the re measurement of intercompany loans that are in a currency other than the functional currency of one of the parties to the loan 
for example  we make intercompany loans based in euros from our corporate division  which is comprised of us dollar functional currency entities  to certain european entities that use the euro as the functional currency 
as the us dollar strengthens against the euro  foreign currency losses are generated on our corporate entities because the number of euros to be received in settlement of the loans decreases in us dollar terms 
conversely  in this example  in periods where the us dollar weakens  our corporate entities will record foreign currency gains 
we recorded net foreign currency exchange gains of million and million during and  respectively  and a loss of million during throughout  the us dollar weakened against most european based currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  creating realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains 
this compares to  when in the latter part of the year the us dollar strengthened against these currencies and we  therefore  recorded realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange losses 
the strengthening of the us dollar continued through the first half of before weakening in the second half  resulting in net realized and unrealized gains 
income tax expense year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations effective income tax rate income loss from continuing operations before income taxes adjust foreign currency exchange gain loss  net adjust goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment adjust gain loss related to investment securities income from continuing operations before income taxes  as adjusted income tax expense benefit adjust income tax expense benefit attributable to foreign currency exchange gain loss  net adjust income tax benefit attributable to goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment income tax expense  as adjusted effective income tax rate  as adjusted we calculate our effective tax rate by dividing income tax expense by pre tax book income 
our effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there are several factors that have caused our effective tax rate to fluctuate over the past three years 
the most significant of these factors include the company s tax position in the us  the impact of foreign currency exchange translation results and  specific to the years ended december  and  the impairments for goodwill and acquired intangible assets and the gains and losses related to investment securities 
excluding foreign currency exchange translation results and the impairments to goodwill and acquired intangible assets and the gains and losses related to investment securities from pre tax income  as well as the related tax effects for these items  our effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the higher adjusted effective tax rates for and compared to were primarily related to the company s tax position in the us and spain  respectively 
in  significant pre tax income from us operations including the federal excise tax refund of million resulted in the recognition of deferred income tax expense from the utilization of tax net operating losses 
due to the goodwill impairment test performed in  we reviewed the impact of the adverse macroeconomic business conditions and outlook  as well as business forecasts  on the realization of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
based on this information  we concluded that a valuation allowance was necessary against the deferred tax assets  including tax net operating losses  of our us and spanish operations 
in  the increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was the result of an inability to recognize the deferred tax benefits of tax net operating losses in spain and an increase in operating income in high tax rate countries 
we determine income tax expense and remit income taxes based upon enacted tax laws and regulations applicable in each of the taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business 
based on our interpretation of such laws and regulations  and considering the evidence of available facts and circumstances and baseline operating forecasts  we have accrued the estimated tax effects of certain transactions  business ventures  contractual and organizational structures  projected business unit performance  and the estimated future reversal of timing differences 
should a taxing jurisdiction change its laws and regulations or dispute our conclusions  or should management become aware of new facts or other evidence that could alter our conclusions  the resulting impact to our estimates could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements 
other discontinued operations  net during the fourth quarter of  we sold essentis for million 
this resulted in an after tax gain of million which is included in discontinued operations  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  essentis s results of operations are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in july  we sold substantially all of the non current assets and related capital lease obligations of our atm processing business in france to atos sa during the first quarter  we received a binding french supreme court decision relating to a lawsuit in france that resulted in a cash recovery and gain of million  net of legal costs 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was million and million for and  respectively  and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was million for noncontrolling interests represents the elimination of net income or loss attributable to the minority shareholders portion of the following consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned percent subsidiary owned segment movilcarga prepaid spain e pay srl prepaid italy atx prepaid various euronet china eft china net income loss attributable to euronet worldwide  inc 
net income attributable to euronet worldwide  inc was million in compared to a net loss of million for and net income of million as more fully discussed above  the increase of million in compared to was mainly the result of the million increase in operating income driven by the million greater non cash goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charge in than in additionally  results include million in unrealized loss on investment securities compared to the million gain in on sale of the same securities 
further  income tax increased million and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased million while foreign currency exchanges gain increased million  net interest expense decreased million  net income from discontinued operations increased million and other items decreased net income by million 
the decrease of million in compared to was also mainly the result of the million impairment charge in and the million federal excise tax refund recorded in which drove the million decrease in operating income 
additionally  results include an million unrealized loss on investment securities and a million increase in foreign currency losses 
furthermore  net interest expense increased million and net income from discontinued operations decreased million 
partly offsetting these losses were a million decrease in income tax expense  a million improvement in income from the net gain on early retirement of debt  a million benefit from changes in results attributed to noncontrolling interests and a million increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates 
translation adjustment translation gains and losses are the result of translating our foreign entities balance sheets from local functional currency to the us dollar reporting currency prior to consolidation and are recorded in comprehensive income loss 
as required by us gaap  during this translation process  asset and liability accounts are translated at current foreign currency exchange rates and equity accounts are translated at historical rates 
historical rates represent the rates in effect when the balances in our equity accounts were originally created 
by using this mix of rates to convert the balance sheet from functional currency to us dollars  differences between current and historical exchange rates generate this translation adjustment 
we recorded a gain loss on translation adjustment of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
throughout  the us dollar weakened against most european based currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  creating translation gains 
in the latter half of  the us dollar strengthened against most of those currencies  resulting in translation losses 
this strengthening continued until the second half of when the us dollar weakened against most of those currencies  resulting in net translation gains which were recorded in comprehensive income loss 
liquidity and capital resources working capital as of december   we had working capital  which is the difference between total current assets and total current liabilities  of million  compared to working capital of million as of december  our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to as of december  the increase in working capital is due primarily to the contributions from operating results  the reduction of current maturities of long term debt and borrowings on revolving debt classified as long term to fund working capital requirements of the money transfer segment 
we require substantial working capital to finance operations 
the money transfer segment funds the correspondent distribution network before receiving the benefit of amounts collected from customers by agents 
working capital needs increase due to weekends and international banking holidays 
as a result  we may report more or less working capital for the money transfer segment based solely upon the fiscal period ending on a particular day 
as of december   working capital in the money transfer segment was million 
we expect that working capital needs will increase as we expand this business 
the prepaid processing segment produces positive working capital  but much of it is restricted in connection with the administration of its customer collection and vendor remittance activities 
the eft processing segment does not require substantial working capital 
operating cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities were million for  compared to million for the increase was primarily the result of improved operating results as adjusted for non cash charges 
improved cash flows from fluctuations in working capital were largely offset by amounts paid to secure an exclusive  long term distribution agreement with a vendor in australia 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to fluctuations in working capital  including the collection of million for the federal excise tax refund that was recognized in net income during the increase in depreciation and amortization expense that is added to net income to arrive at operating cash flows is due largely to the inclusion of ria for a full year  compared to nine months in other fluctuations in working capital are mainly the result of changes in the timing of the settlement process with mobile operators in the prepaid processing segment around year end 
investing activity cash flows cash flows used in investing activities were million for  compared to million for our investing activities include million and million for the purchase of property and equipment  software development and other long term assets in and  respectively 
our acquisitions used million and million in and  respectively 
our investing activities for included million in proceeds from the sale of essentis  million from the sale of moneygram common stock and million from the sale of property and equipment 
our investing activities for include the return of million we placed in escrow in in connection with the agreement to acquire envios de valores la nacional corp 
la nacional 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with la nacional and its stockholder evidencing the parties mutual agreement not to consummate the acquisition  in exchange for payment by euronet of a portion of the legal fees incurred by la nacional 
cash flows used in investing activities were million for  compared to million for as discussed above  our investing activities for include the return of million we placed in escrow in our investing activities also include million and million for the purchase of property and equipment  software development and other long term assets in and  respectively 
while our acquisitions in were million  we used million in  primarily for the acquisition of ria  and another million to purchase moneygram common stock 
financing activity cash flows cash flows used in financing activities were million during  compared to million during our financing activities consisted primarily of net repayments of debt obligations of million and million for and  respectively 
to support the short term cash needs of our money transfer segment  we generally borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility several times each month to fund the correspondent network in advance of collecting remittance amounts from the agency network 
these borrowings are repaid over a very short period of time  generally within a few days 
primarily as a result of this  during and  we had a total of million and million in borrowings  respectively  and million and million in repayments  respectively  under our revolving credit facility 
during and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  in principal amount of our convertible debentures for million and million in cash  respectively 
additionally  we paid million in and million in on our term loan 
finally  we paid million and million of capital lease obligations during and  respectively 
cash flows used in financing activities were million during  compared to million of cash provided during our financing activities for consisted primarily of net repayments of debt obligations of million 
our financing activities for consisted primarily of million in proceeds from borrowings under our term loan agreement that were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of ria and proceeds from the equity private placement and stock option exercises totaling million 
partially offsetting these increases were repayments and early retirements of debt obligations of million  net repayments of borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million and repayments of capital lease obligations of million 
we also paid dividends to holders of noncontrolling interests of million and debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility of million 
other sources of capital credit facility in connection with completing the april acquisition of ria  we entered into a million secured credit facility consisting of a million seven year term loan  which was fully drawn at closing  and a million five year revolving credit facility together  the credit facility 
the million seven year term loan bears interest at libor plus basis points or prime plus basis points and requires that we repay million of the balance each year  with the remaining balance payable at the end of the seven year term 
we have prepaid amounts on this loan and we estimate that we will be able to repay the remaining million term loan prior to its maturity date through cash flows available from operations  provided our operating cash flows are not required for future business developments 
up front financing costs of million were deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the respective loans 
during april  we entered into an amendment to the credit facility to  among other things  i change the definition of one of the financial covenants in the original agreement to exclude the effect of certain one time expenses and ii allow for the repurchase of up to million aggregate principal amount of the million in convertible senior debentures due during  we repurchased in privately negotiated transactions million in principal amount of the debentures 
additionally  we incurred costs of million in connection with the amendment  which will be recognized as additional interest expense over the remaining term of the credit facility 
during february  we entered into amendment no 
to the credit facility to  among other things  i a grant us the ability to repurchase the remaining million of outstanding convertible senior debentures due and b repurchase our convertible debentures due prior to any repurchase date using proceeds of a qualifying refinancing  the proceeds of a qualifying equity issuance or shares of common stock  ii revise the definition of consolidated ebitda and the covenant regarding maintenance of consolidated net worth to exclude the effect of non cash charges for impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets for the periods ending december  and thereafter  and iii broaden or otherwise modify various definitions or provisions related to indebtedness  liens  permitted disposition  debt transactions  investments and other matters 
we incurred costs of approximately million in connection with the amendment  which will be recognized as additional interest expense over the remaining term of the credit facility 
the million five year revolving credit facility bears interest at libor or prime plus a margin that adjusts each quarter based upon our consolidated ebitda ratio as defined in the credit facility agreement 
we intend to use the revolving credit facility primarily to fund working capital requirements  which are expected to increase as we expand the money transfer business 
based on our current projected working capital requirements  we anticipate that our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs 
we may be required to repay our obligations under the credit facility six months before the potential repurchase dates  the first being october   under our million convertible debentures due  unless we are able to demonstrate that either i we could borrow unsubordinated funded debt equal to the principal amount of the applicable convertible debentures while remaining in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit facility or ii we will have sufficient liquidity to meet repayment requirements as determined by the administrative agent and the lenders 
these and other material terms and conditions applicable to the credit facility are described in the agreement governing the credit facility 
the term loan may be expanded by up to an additional million and the revolving credit facility can be expanded by up to an additional million  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including pro forma debt covenant compliance 
as of december   we had borrowings of million outstanding against the term loan 
we had borrowings of million and stand by letters of credit and bank guarantees of million outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
the remaining million under the revolving credit facility million if the facility were increased to million was available for borrowing 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are being used to fund short term working capital requirements in the us  spain and india 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate was under the revolving credit facility and under the term loan  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs 
short term debt obligations short term debt obligations at december  were primarily the million convertible senior debentures due  as we elected to redeem the outstanding debentures in january  and the million annual repayment requirement under the term loan 
certain of our subsidiaries also have available credit lines and overdraft facilities to supplement short term working capital requirements  but there were no amounts outstanding against these facilities as of december  we believe that the short term debt obligations can be funded through cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
convertible debt we have million in principal amount of convertible debentures due that are convertible into million shares of euronet common stock at a conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the closing prices of euronet common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods 
we will pay contingent interest for the six month period from october  through april  and for each six month period thereafter from april to october or october to april if the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day period preceding such applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
contingent interest will equal per annum of the average trading price of a debenture for such five trading day periods 
the debentures may not be redeemed by us until october  but are redeemable at par at any time thereafter 
holders of the debentures have the option to require us to purchase their debentures at par on october   and  or upon a change in control of the company 
on the maturity date  these debentures can be settled in cash or euronet common stock  at our option  at predetermined conversion rates 
should holders of the convertible debentures require us to repurchase their debentures on the dates outlined above  we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash on hand or have acceptable financing options available to us to fund these required repurchases 
an inability to be able to finance these potential repayments could have an adverse impact on our operations 
these terms and other material terms and conditions applicable to the convertible debentures are set forth in the indenture agreements governing these debentures and in note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we also had million in principal amount of convertible senior debentures due we elected to redeem the outstanding debentures effective january at par 
proceeds from issuance of shares and other capital contributions we have established  and shareholders have approved  share compensation plans that allow the company to make grants of shares of restricted common stock  or options to purchase shares of common stock  to certain current and prospective key employees  directors and consultants 
during   stock options were exercised at an average exercise price of  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
we also sponsor a qualified employee stock purchase plan espp under which we reserved  shares of common stock for purchase under the plan by employees through payroll deductions according to specific eligibility and participation requirements 
this plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section of the internal revenue code of offerings commence at the beginning of each quarter and expire at the end of the quarter 
under the plan  participating employees are granted options  which immediately vest and are automatically exercised on the final date of the respective offering period 
the exercise price of common stock options purchased is the lesser of of the fair market value as defined in the espp of the shares on the first day of each offering or the last day of each offering 
the options are funded by participating employees payroll deductions or cash payments 
during  we issued  shares at an average price of per share  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
these plans are discussed further in note  stock plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
other uses of capital payment obligations related to acquisitions we have potential contingent obligations to the former owner of the net assets of movilcarga 
based upon presently available information  we do not believe any additional payments will be required 
the seller disputed this conclusion and initiated arbitration as provided for in the purchase agreement 
a global public accounting firm was engaged as an independent expert to review the results of the computation  but the legal process in the dispute has remained dormant for over a year 
any additional payments  if ultimately determined to be owed the seller  will be recorded as additional goodwill and could be made in either cash or a combination of cash and euronet common stock at our option 
in connection with the acquisition of brodos romania  we agreed to contingent consideration arrangements based on the achievement of certain performance criteria 
if the criteria are achieved  we would have to pay a total of million in cash or  shares of euronet common stock  at the option of the seller 
however  brodos romania failed to achieve the performance criteria by january for the first million and based on its current performance  it is unlikely to achieve the performance criteria during for the remaining amounts 
leases we lease atms and other property and equipment under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and per year 
as of december   we owed million under these capital lease arrangements 
the majority of these lease agreements are entered into in connection with long term outsourcing agreements where  generally  we purchase a bank s atms and simultaneously sell the atms to an entity related to the bank and lease back the atms for purposes of fulfilling the atm outsourcing agreement with the bank 
we fully recover the related lease costs from the bank under the outsourcing agreements 
generally  the leases may be canceled without penalty upon reasonable notice in the unlikely event the bank or we were to terminate the related outsourcing agreement 
we expect that  if terms were acceptable  we would acquire more atms from banks under such outsourcing and lease agreements 
capital expenditures and needs total capital expenditures for were million  of which million were funded through capital leases 
these capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of atms to meet contractual requirements in poland and india  the purchase and installation of atms in key under penetrated markets  the purchase of pos terminals for the prepaid processing and money transfer segments  and office and data center computer equipment and software 
included in capital expenditures for office and data center equipment and software for is approximately million in capital expenditures for the purchase and development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities to enter the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million to million 
an additional million in software development cost was capitalized during for the development and enhancement of our eft processing segment software products 
see note  computer software to be sold  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
in the prepaid processing segment  approximately  of the approximately  pos devices that we operate are company owned  with the remaining terminals being operated as integrated cash register devices of our major retail customers or owned by the retailers 
as our prepaid processing segment expands  we will continue to add terminals in certain independent retail locations at a price of approximately per terminal 
we expect the proportion of owned terminals to total terminals operated to remain relatively constant 
at current and projected cash flow levels  we anticipate that cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand and amounts available under our revolving credit facility and other existing and potential future financing will be sufficient to meet our debt  leasing  contingent acquisition and capital expenditure obligations 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet these obligations  we will seek to refinance our debt and or issue additional equity under terms acceptable to us 
however  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain favorable terms for the refinancing of any of our debt or other obligations or for the issuance of additional equity 
in the eft processing segment  we are required to maintain atm hardware for euronet owned atms and software for all atms in our network and in our processing centers in accordance with certain regulations and mandates established by local country regulatory and administrative bodies as well as emv europay  mastercard and visa chip card support 
additionally  as regulations change or new regulations or mandates are issued  we may have additional capital expenditures over the next few years to maintain compliance with these regulations and or mandates 
while we do not currently have plans to increase capital expenditures to expand our network of owned atms  we expect that if strategic opportunities were available to us  we would consider increasing future capital expenditures to expand this network in new or existing markets 
contingencies in the second quarter  the antitrust division of the united states department of justice the doj served continental exchange solutions  inc d b a ria financial service ces  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of the company  with a grand jury subpoena requesting documents from ces and its affiliates in connection with an investigation into money transmission services to the dominican republic during the period from january  to the date of the subpoena 
we acquired all of the stock of ria envia  inc  the parent of ces  in april the company and ces are fully cooperating with the doj in its investigation 
at this time  we are unable to predict whether this investigation will result in the doj bringing charges against ces 
accordingly  we are unable to predict the outcome of this investigation  the possible loss or possible range of loss  if any  associated with the resolution of any charges that may be brought against ces  or any potential effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  from time to time  we are a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
currently  there are no other contingencies that we believe  either individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
other trends and uncertainties cross border merchant processing and acquiring in our eft processing segment  we have entered the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business  through the execution of an agreement with a large petrol retailer in central europe 
since the beginning of  we have devoted significant resources  including capital expenditures of approximately million  to the ongoing investment in development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities to enter this business  which involves the purchase and design of hardware and software 
merchant acquiring involves processing credit and debit card transactions that are made on pos terminals  including authorization  settlement  and processing of settlement files 
it involves the assumption of credit risk  as the principal amount of transactions is settled to merchants before settlements are received from card associations 
we incurred million in operating losses related to this business in and expect to incur approximately million to million in operating losses during stock plans historically  the compensation committee of our board of directors has awarded nonvested shares or nonvested share units restricted stock and stock options as an element of long term management incentive compensation 
the amount of future compensation expense related to awards of restricted stock is based on the market price for euronet common stock at the grant date 
for grants of stock options  we used the black scholes option pricing model or monte carlo simulation model for the determination of fair value for stock option grants and plan to use the black scholes option pricing model or monte carlo simulation model  as appropriate  for future stock option grants  if any 
the grant date for stock options or restricted stock is the date at which all key terms and conditions of the grant have been determined and the company becomes contingently obligated to transfer assets to the employee who renders the requisite service  generally the date at which grants are approved by our board of directors or compensation committee thereof 
share based compensation expense for awards with only service conditions is generally recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions  expense is recognized on a graded attribution method 
the graded attribution method results in expense recognition on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of an award  as if the award was  in substance  multiple awards 
expense for stock options and restricted stock is generally recorded as a corporate expense 
we have total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option and restricted stock awards of million that will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
inflation and functional currencies generally  the countries in which we operate have experienced low and stable inflation in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
due to these factors  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries where we operate 
off balance sheet arrangements we have certain significant off balance sheet items described below and in the following section  contractual obligations also see note  guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  we had million of bank guarantees issued on our behalf  of which million are collateralized by cash deposits held by the respective issuing banks and million are supported by stand by letters of credit issued against the revolving credit facility 
these letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
on occasion we grant guarantees in support of obligations of subsidiaries 
as of december   we had granted guarantees for cash in various atm networks amounting to million over the terms of the cash supply agreements and performance guarantees amounting to approximately million over the terms of the agreements with the customers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with unaffiliated parties that contain indemnification provisions  the terms of which may vary depending on the negotiated terms of each respective agreement 
the amount of such obligations is not stated in the agreements 
our liability under such indemnification provisions may be subject to time and materiality limitations  monetary caps and other conditions and defenses 
such indemnity obligations include the following in connection with contracts with financial institutions in the eft processing segment  we are responsible for damages to atms and theft of atm network cash that  generally  is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the balance of atm network cash for which we were responsible was approximately million 
we maintain insurance policies to mitigate this exposure  in connection with the license of proprietary systems to customers  we provide certain warranties and infringement indemnities to the licensee  which generally warrant that such systems do not infringe on intellectual property owned by third parties and that the systems will perform in accordance with their specifications  we have entered into purchase and service agreements with our vendors and into consulting agreements with providers of consulting services  pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify certain of such vendors and consultants  respectively  against third party claims arising from our use of the vendor s product or the services of the vendor or consultant  in connection with acquisitions and dispositions of subsidiaries  operating units and business assets  we have entered into agreements containing indemnification provisions  which are generally described as follows i in connection with acquisitions made by euronet  we have agreed to indemnify the seller against third party claims made against the seller relating to the subject subsidiary  operating unit or asset and arising after the closing of the transaction  and ii in connection with dispositions made by us  we have agreed to indemnify the buyer against damages incurred by the buyer due to the buyer s reliance on representations and warranties relating to the subject subsidiary  operating unit or business assets in the disposition agreement if such representations or warranties were untrue when made  we have entered into agreements with certain third parties  including banks that provide fiduciary and other services to euronet or to our benefit plans 
under such agreements  we have agreed to indemnify such service providers for third party claims relating to the carrying out of their respective duties under such agreements  and in connection with our entry into the money transfer business  we have issued surety bonds in compliance with licensing requirements of the applicable governmental authorities 
we are also required to meet minimum capitalization and cash requirements of various regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we have money transfer operations 
we are not aware of any significant claims made by the indemnified parties or third parties to guarantee agreements with us and  accordingly  no liabilities were recorded as of december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations  including interest estimated contingent acquisition obligations obligations under capital leases obligations under operating leases total for the purposes of the above table  our million convertible debentures issued in october are considered due during  representing the first year in which holders have the right to exercise their put option 
additionally  the above table only includes interest on these convertible debentures up to these dates 
although in certain circumstances we may be required to repay our obligations under the credit facility six months before any potential repurchase date under our million convertible debentures  the table above assumes that these circumstances will not be met and the credit facility will be fully repaid at maturity 
we have assumed million  the december  balance  will be outstanding at all times under the revolving credit facility 
the computation of interest for debt obligations with variable interest rates reflects interest rates in effect at december  for additional information on debt obligations  see note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
estimated contingent acquisition obligations as of december  are additional consideration to be settled in cash or euronet common stock that we may have to pay during in connection with the acquisition of brodos  totaling up to million 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these acquisitions 
for additional information on capital and operating lease obligations  see note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total liability for uncertain tax positions under accounting standards codification asc and formerly financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
was million as of december  we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  however  at this time  we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next year 
see note  taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which the actual results will emerge over time 
these judgments  assumptions and estimates affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies and practices  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical estimates and assumptions are used for computing income taxes  estimating the useful lives and potential impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  as well as allocating the purchase price to assets acquired in acquisitions  and revenue recognition 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies and estimates are forward looking statements and are impacted significantly by estimates and should be read in conjunction with item a risk factors 
actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward looking statements 
accounting for income taxes the deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the liability method 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment 
the statement of operations effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  on the balance sheet as measured by differences in the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we have significant tax loss carryforwards  and other temporary differences  which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets realizable in future periods are recorded net of a valuation allowance based on an assessment of each entity s  or group of entities  ability to generate sufficient taxable income within an appropriate period  in a specific tax jurisdiction 
in assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as more fully described in note  taxes  to the consolidated financial statements  gross deferred tax assets were million as of december   partially offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we make judgments and estimates on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income in each country in which we operate  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowance at december  if we have a history of generating taxable income in a certain country in which we operate  and baseline forecasts project continued taxable income in this country  we will reduce the valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we expect to realize 
additionally  we follow the provisions of asc and to account for uncertainty in income tax positions 
applying the standard requires substantial management judgment and use of estimates in determining whether the impact of a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit by the relevant taxing authority 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
it is reasonably possible that amounts reserved for potential exposure could change significantly as a result of the conclusion of tax examinations and  accordingly  materially affect our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
r  we allocate the acquisition purchase price to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired is supported by valuations using estimates and assumptions provided by management 
for larger or more complex acquisitions  management engages an appraiser to assist in the valuation 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet includes goodwill of million and acquired intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 on an annual basis  and whenever events or circumstances dictate  we test for impairment 
impairment tests are performed annually during the fourth quarter and are performed at the reporting unit level 
generally  fair value represents discounted projected future cash flows and potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
our annual impairment tests during the years and indicated that there were no impairments 
as a result of our annual impairment test for the year ended december   we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million 
see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this charge 
determining the fair value of reporting units requires significant management judgment in estimating future cash flows and assessing potential market and economic conditions 
it is reasonably possible that our operations will not perform as expected  or that estimates or assumptions could change  which may result in the recording of additional material non cash impairment charges during the year in which these changes take place 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the respective asset 
the same estimates are also used in planning for our long and short range business planning and forecasting 
we assess the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the respective asset 
assets to be disposed are required to be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are required to be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
reviewing long lived assets for impairment requires considerable judgment 
estimating the future cash flows requires significant judgment 
if future cash flows do not materialize as expected or there is a future adverse change in market conditions  we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of an asset  resulting in future impairment losses 
revenue recognition in accordance with us gaap  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenues are comprised of monthly recurring management fees and transaction based fees that are recognized when the transactions are processed or the services are performed 
when determining the proper revenue recognition for monthly management fees and transaction based fees  we consider the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revenue recognition  asc formerly emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as principle versus net as an agent  asc formerly eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and various other interpretations 
certain of our noncancelable customer contracts provide for the receipt of up front fees paid to or received from the customer and or decreasing or increasing fee schedules over the agreement term for substantially the same level of services provided by the company 
as prescribed by sab and sab  we recognize revenue under these contracts based on proportional performance of services over the term of the contract  which generally results in straight line revenue recognition of the contracts total cash flows  including any up front payment 
we also record certain revenues in the eft processing segment related to the sale of eft software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems  including professional fees for implementation and customization  ongoing software maintenance and associated computer hardware 
when determining the proper revenue recognition for these items  in addition to sab  sab  and asc  we also consider the guidance contained in asc formerly statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and asc formerly sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
applying us gaap revenue recognition guidance to the software business requires detailed knowledge of the rules and is subject to complex judgment 
for the year ended december   revenues from software and software related products and services represented less than of our total consolidated revenues 
substantial management judgment and estimation is required in determining the proper revenue recognition methodology for our various revenue producing activities  as well as the proper and consistent application of our determined methodology 
impact of new and emerging accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu formerly emerging issues task force consensus 
asu adds estimated selling price as acceptable evidence of fair value of undelivered products and services in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
estimated selling price can be used if there is no vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value 
additionally  asu eliminates the use of the residual method of allocating revenue and establishes the relative selling price method as the appropriate means to allocate revenue to each deliverable of an arrangement 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or modified for fiscal years beginning on or after june  with earlier application permitted 
we are evaluating the impact that the adoption of asu will have on our financial statements and whether we will elect early application  however  the impact is not expected to be material 
forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document are forward looking statements  including statements regarding the following our business plans and financing plans and requirements  trends affecting our business plans and financing plans and requirements  trends affecting our business  the adequacy of capital to meet our capital requirements and expansion plans  the assumptions underlying our business plans  business strategy  government regulatory action  technological advances  or projected costs and revenues 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those referred to above and as set forth in item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in connection with completing the acquisition of ria in april  we entered into a million secured syndicated credit facility consisting of a million seven year term loan  which was fully drawn at closing  and a million five year revolving credit facility  which accrue interest at variable rates 
this credit facility replaced our million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility may be expanded by up to an additional million in term loans and up to an additional million for the revolving line of credit  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including pro forma debt covenant compliance 
this facility substantially increased our interest rate risk 
as of december   our total outstanding debt was million 
of this amount  million  or of our total debt obligations  relates to contingent convertible debentures having fixed coupon rates 
our million contingent convertible debentures  issued in october  accrue interest at a rate of per annum 
the million contingent convertible debentures  issued in december accrue interest at a rate of per annum 
based on quoted market prices  as of december  the fair value of our fixed rate convertible debentures was million  compared to a carrying value of million 
interest expense  including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  for our total million in fixed rate debt totals approximately million per year  which equates to a weighted average interest rate of annually 
additionally  approximately million  or of our total debt obligations  relate to capitalized leases with fixed payment and interest terms that expire between and the remaining million  or  of our total debt obligations relates to debt that accrues interest at variable rates 
if we were to maintain these borrowings for one year and maximize the potential borrowings available under the revolving credit facility for one year  including the million in potential additional expanded borrowings  a increase in the applicable interest rate would result in additional annualized interest expense of approximately million 
this computation excludes the potential million from an expanded term loan because of the limited circumstances under which the additional amounts would be available to us for borrowing 
for more information regarding our debt obligations  see note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
our excess cash is invested in instruments with original maturities of three months or less  therefore  as investments mature and are reinvested  the amount we earn will increase or decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the years ended december  and  of our revenues were generated in non us dollar countries 
we expect to continue generating a significant portion of our revenues in countries with currencies other than the us dollar 
we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar to the currencies of countries in which we have significant operations  primarily to the euro  british pound  australian dollar and polish zloty 
as of december   we estimate that a fluctuation in these foreign currency exchange rates would have the combined annualized effect on reported net income and working capital of approximately million to million 
this effect is estimated by applying a adjustment factor to our non us dollar results from operations  intercompany loans that generate foreign currency gains or losses and working capital balances that require translation from the respective functional currency to the us dollar reporting currency 
additionally  we have other non current  non us dollar assets and liabilities on our balance sheet that are translated to the us dollar during consolidation 
these items primarily represent goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions in countries other than the us we estimate that a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates would have a non cash impact on total comprehensive income of approximately million to million as a result of the change in value of these items during translation to the us dollar 
for the fluctuations described above  a strengthening us dollar produces a financial loss  while a weakening us dollar produces a financial gain 
we believe this quantitative measure has inherent limitations and does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies 
because a majority of our revenues and expenses are incurred in the functional currencies of our international operating entities  the profits we earn in foreign currencies are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar and negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar 
additionally  our debt obligations are primarily in us dollars  therefore  as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  the amount available for repayment of debt will also increase or decrease 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our money transfer segment 
a majority of the money transfer business involves receiving and disbursing different currencies  in which we earn a foreign currency spread based on the difference between buying currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
this spread provides some protection against currency fluctuations that occur while we are holding the foreign currency 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is limited by the fact that disbursement occurs for the majority of transactions shortly after they are initiated 
additionally  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to help offset foreign currency exposure related to the notional value of money transfer transactions collected in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december   we had foreign currency derivative instruments  primarily forward contracts  outstanding with a notional value of million  primarily in euros that were not designated as hedges and mature in a weighted average of days 
the fair value of these forward contracts as of december  was an unrealized gain of less than million  which was mostly offset by the unrealized loss on the related foreign currency receivables
