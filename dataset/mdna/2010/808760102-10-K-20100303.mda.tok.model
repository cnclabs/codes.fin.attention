item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview we develop  distribute and license technology that accelerates learning by improving the processing efficiency of the brain 
based on more than thirty years of neuroscience and cognitive research  our family of products improves brain fitness with technology based exercises that build the cognitive skills required to read and learn effectively 
extensive outcomes research by independent researchers  our founding scientists  school districts and our company demonstrates the rapid and lasting gains achieved through participation in our products 
our products are marketed primarily to k schools in the us  to whom we sell through a direct sales force 
to facilitate the use of our products  we offer a variety of on site and remote professional and technical services  as well as phone  email and web based support 
since our inception  learners have used our products over two million times and approximately  schools have purchased at least  of our product licenses and services 
as of december  we had full time equivalent employees  compared to at december  business highlights we market our fast forword and reading assistant products primarily as a reading intervention solution for struggling and special education students and english language learners 
according to the us department of education  in  of fourth graders in the united states had below basic reading scores and were not proficient in reading  and between and there was only a modest improvement in the proportion of fourth graders performing at the below basic level 
while our installed base is growing  the approximately  schools that have purchased at least  of our product licenses and services represent a small fraction of the approximately  k schools in the us 
federal education funds are a critical resource in helping school districts address the needs of the most challenged learners 
we believe that a significant proportion of our sales are funded by federal sources  particularly title one and idea special education grants 
with the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act arra the recent stimulus bill  these two federal sources are estimated to have increased from billion in the school year to billion in the school year 
in most states the arra funds have been and are being disbursed to school districts  and we believe that the arra funding has had a substantial positive impact on our sales 
states provide school districts with the majority of their funding  and those funds are also sometimes used to purchase our products 
states faced severe budget shortfalls in fiscal and forecast continuing funding difficulties in the national conference of state legislatures estimates that the cumulative state budget gap was billion in fiscal  and in june  forecast a cumulative budget gap for fiscal of billion  involving states 
in  we launched our first products and services sold directly to parents 
brainspark is for learners at or above grade level who want to improve their learning potential and brainpro is for learners below grade level who want to catch up 
both offerings are delivered via saas software as a service  a model of software deployment whereby we license our software on demand as a service to the end user 
neither offering contributed a significant amount of sales in company highlights for the year ended december   our total revenue increased by and our total booked sales increased by over booked sales is a non gaap financial measure 
for more explanation on booked sales  see revenue below 
k sales increased by in the year ended december   compared to  as the flow of federal stimulus funds to individual school districts and the spending requirements linked to these funds put school districts in a better position to execute new purchases 
booked sales and revenue also benefited from a large million deal that closed in early july 
for the year ended december   we closed transactions in excess of  compared to in non school sales  including private practice  internation al and oem customers  decreased by in compared to we believe that the decrease was primarily caused by adverse economic conditions affecting our customers in both the private practice and international markets 
operating expenses were flat in compared with  as cost savings resulting from our restructuring initiative in january were partially offset by increased bonus and commission expense arising from our strong financial performance 

table of contents results of operations revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands change change products service and support total revenues revenue compared to product revenues increased by in compared to the increase in was primarily due to higher us k booked sales  which reflected the increased federal funding made available to schools by arra 
booked sales included one transaction for million for which we recognized product revenue of million 
our service and support revenue was flat in compared to in we recognized oem revenue relating to the reading assistant operations that we did not repeat in this was offset primarily by an increase in the number of implementation service days delivered 
revenue compared to product revenues decreased by in compared to the decrease was mainly because one large transaction for approximately million was booked in and no similarly sized transaction was booked in this transaction included approximately million of product revenue that was recognized during our largest transaction in was for approximately million  including approximately  of product revenue that was recognized in our service and support revenue increased by in compared to due to a higher number of schools on support  more services delivered  higher revenue for the reading progress indicator and oem revenue from the operations we purchased in our acquisition of soliloquy in january at december  we had approximately more schools on support than at december  booked sales and selling activity booked sales is a non gaap financial measure that management uses to evaluate current selling activity 
we believe that booked sales is a useful metric for investors as well as management because it is the most direct measure of current demand for our products and services 
booked sales equals the total value net of allowances of software  services and support invoiced in the period 
revenue on a gaap basis is recorded for booked sales when all four of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met  if any of the requirements to recognize revenue are not met  the sale is recorded as deferred revenue 
we use booked sales information for resource allocation  planning  compensation and other management purpos es 
we believe that revenue is the most comparable gaap measure to booked sales 
however  booked sales should not be considered in isolation from revenue  and is not intended to represent a substitute measure of revenue or any other performance measure calculated under gaap 
the following reconciliation table sets forth our booked sales  revenues and change in deferred revenue for the twelve months ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands change change booked sales less revenue recognized other adjustments net increase decrease in deferred revenue total deferred revenue end of period booked sales in the k sector increased by to million for compared to million in booked sales in the k sector were million in the flow of federal stimulus funds to individual school districts and the spending requirements linked to these funds put school districts in a better position to execute new purchases during the year 
as previously noted  one large transaction for approximately million was booked in  whereas the largest transaction booked in was for approximately million 
our total booked sales for decreased by from the decrease in booked sales was mainly because one large transaction for approximately million was booked in and no similar sized transaction was booked in booked sales to the k sector in represented of total booked sales  compared to in and in other adjustments consists primarily of sales with fob destination delivery terms that had not been delivered by year end  and therefore no deferred revenue or receivable was recorded for these transactions 

table of contents we believe large booked sales  which we define as transactions totaling more than  are an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in reaching our goal of increasing sales force productivity 
in we continued to focus our sales force on multi site sales  and we closed transactions in excess of  compared to in and in for the year ended december   of our booked sales arose from transactions over  for the comparable periods ending december  and  large booked sales accounted for and of booked sales respectively 
large booked sales include volume and negotiated discounts but the percentage discount applicable to any given transaction will vary and the relative percentage o f large booked sales and smaller booked sales in a given quarter may fluctuate 
because we discount product license fees but do not discount service and support fees  product booked sales and revenue are disproportionately affected by discounting 
we cannot predict the size and number of large transactions in the future 
booked sales to non school customers primarily to private practice clinicians and international value added resellers decreased by in  as a result of adverse economic conditions 
in addition  in we recorded oem booked sales of approximately million from the operations we purchased in our acquisition of soliloquy in january  compared with  in booked sales outside the k market increased by in compared with  mainly due to the incremental oem sales as well as our continued expansion of the international and private practice channels 
although the current economic and financial conditions  the temporary nature of federal stimulus funding  and federal  state and local budget pressures make for an uncertain funding environment for our customers  we remain optimistic about our growth prospects in the k market 
however  achieving our growth objectives will depend on increasing customer acceptance of our products  which requires us to continue to focus on improving our products ease of use  their fit with school requirements  and our connection with classroom teachers and administrators 
our k growth prospects are also influenced by factors outside our control  including general economic conditions and the overall level  certainty and allocation of state  local and federal funding 
while federal funding for education has grown s teadily over the last few decades  the current level of federal spending and the federal deficit are likely to put pressure on all areas in the federal budget 
in addition  school district spending based on federal education stimulus funding is expected to decline after or states continue to experience severe budget pressure from the adverse conditions in the job  housing and credit markets  these conditions may continue to impact state education spending 
in addition  the revenue recognized from our booked sales can be unpredictable 
our various license and service packages have substantially differing revenue recognition periods  and it is often difficult to predict which license package a customer will purchase  even when the amount and timing of a sale can be reasonably projected 
in addition  the timing of a single large order or its implementation can significantly impact the level of booked sales and revenue at any given time 
see risk factors for a further discussion of some of the factors that affect our sales and revenue 
gross profit and cost of revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit on products gross profit margin on products gross profit on service and support gross profit margin on services and support total gross profit total gross profit margin the overall gross profit margin increased by basis points in compared to the prior year  mainly due to a revenue mix shift and higher service and support margins 
higher margin product revenues made up of total revenues in  compared to in product margins in increased basis points over  as proportionately lower royalty costs were partially offset by increased amortization expense arising from the intangible assets acquired from soliloquy and product costs associated with reading assistant 
service and support margins improved in compared to principally due to year over year price increases and cost savings resulting from more efficient delivery of services 

table of contents the overall gross profit margin decreased in compared to the prior year due to a shift in revenue mix 
higher margin product revenues made up of total revenues in compared to in product margins declined in  mainly due to the impact of the amortization expense arising from the intangible assets acquired from soliloquy and product costs associated with reading assistant 
service and support gross margins improved because a larger proportion of these revenues arose from support and progress tracker  which have higher margins than training and implementation services 
operating expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands change change sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses in january we announced a reduction in our workforce which was implemented during the first quarter of the expected savings in salaries and benefit costs from this action are approximately million annually 
in we paid severance costs of approximately on september   we announced a plan to consolidate our product development and product management leadership functions in our oakland  california headquarters  mainly for strategic reasons 
under this plan  we closed our waltham  massachusetts office in december and eight waltham research and development employees left the company 
in the fourth quarter of we determined that we needed to completely redesign our brainspark website and accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of  the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying amount of the website capitalized costs with the net present value of expected future cash flows to be generated by the website 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries and incentive compensation paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities  travel costs  tradeshows  conferences  and marketing and promotional materials 
the increase in is mostly due to higher commission expense of approximately million as a result of the strong sales performance  partially offset by lower salary and benefit costs as a result of the restructuring actions taken in january the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared to is primarily due to a reduction of approximately million in incentive compensation and consulting costs  partially offset by an increase of approximately  in salary and benefit costs resulting mainly from severance payments 
at december   we had quota bearing sales personnel compared to and at december  and  respectively 
research and development research and development expenses principally consist of compensation paid to employees and consultants engaged in research and product development activities and product testing  together with software and equipment costs 
the decrease for is primarily due to the capitalization of approximately  of development costs relating to our reading assistant expanded edition product  partially offset by increased bonus expense of approximately  no development costs were capitalized in either or research and development expenses increased by in compared to  mostly due to increased development personnel costs stemming from the soliloquy acquisition 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to our executives  accounting staff and other support personnel  as well as travel expenses for these employees  and outside legal and accounting fees 
the increase in compared to is primarily due to increases in bonus expenses of approximately  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of  general and administrative expenses also increased by in compared to the increase in is mostly caused by higher bad debt expense of  and severance costs of  partially offset by lower legal expenses  which decreased by  
table of contents interest and other income year ended december  dollars in thousands change change interest on invested cash interest expense on bank loan na na reclassification of service revenue miscellaneous interest and other income interest and other income decreased in compared to mainly because of lower reclassifications of service and support revenue relating to the amortization of deferred revenue for customers for whom we are no longer performing services  lower interest paid on our cash balances  and interest expense on our bank loan from january through august the main cause of the decrease from to was lower interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and declining interest rates 
income tax provision during we recorded an income tax expense of approximately  as of december   we have us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the us federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through as of december   we have us federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
california state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
during  we recorded an income tax expense of million 
this expense primarily consisted of a million increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance increase was the result of recording a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
after considering all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income  we concluded that we could no longer support a deferred tax asset balance 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
during we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million 
this benefit included a million reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to a portion of our deferred tax assets that in our opinion would more likely than not be realized  based on future projected taxable income for fiscal prior to  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
these projections were based on one year of projected future taxable income 
net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards reflected above are limited due to ownership changes as provided in the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit line 
during we expended million of our cash for the acquisition of the assets of soliloquy learning 
we expect that during at least the next twelve months our cash flow from operations together with our current cash balances will be our primary source of liquidity and will be sufficient to provide the necessary funds for our operations and capital expenditures 
historically  we have used cash in our operations during the first half of the year and built cash in the second half 
this pattern results largely from our seasonally low sales in the first calendar quarter  which reflects our industry pattern  and the time needed to collect on sales made towards the end of the second quarter 
we expect that this pattern will continue  and that we will use cash in operations during the first half of however  we expect that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements during the first half of fiscal accomplishing this  however  will require us to meet specific booked sales targets in the k market 
we cannot assure you that we will meet our targets with respect to booked sales  revenues  expenses or operating results 

table of contents on february  we amended our existing revolving line of credit agreement with comerica bank 
the maximum that can be borrowed under the agreement is million 
the line expires on december  borrowing under the line of credit bears interest at a daily adjusting libor rate 
borrowings under the line are subject to reporting covenants requiring the provision of financial statements to comerica  and  as amended  financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of and positive net worth 
the agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit not to exceed million 
at december   we have an outstanding letter of credit for  there were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit at december  and we were in compliance with all our covenants 
in february we borrowed m illion from the line of credit which we repaid in august if we are unable to achieve sufficient cash flow from operations  we may seek other sources of debt or equity financing  or may be required to reduce expenses 
reducing our expenses could adversely affect operations by reducing the resources available for sales  marketing  research or product development 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
cash provided by operations in was million  compared to net cash used in operations in of million and cash provided by operations of million in this improvement was mainly the result of higher net income and receivable collections resulting from our stronger sales performance 
we collected million of receivables in  compared to million in  and million in net cash used in investing activities for was million  due to capital spending and additions to capitalized software 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  of which million relates to the acquisition of soliloquy learning assets 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  consisting of net purchases of property and equipment of million  a loan to jtt holdings of million in connection with the acquisition of soliloquy  and deferred acquisition costs incurred of  net cash generated by financing activities in  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash generated by financing activities in all three years resulted from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and through purchases of stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
in we borrowed and repaid million from our credit facility 
there was no borrowing on our credit line in or off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments we have a non cancelable lease agreement for our corporate office facilities in oakland  california 
the minimum lease payment was approximately  per month through from through the end of the lease  the base lease payment increases at a compound annual rate of approximately 
the lease expires in december we also have a lease agreement for our tucson  arizona office through may at an average rent of approximately  per month 
in early  we entered into a lease for our reading assistant operations in waltham  massachusetts for approximately  square feet at an average monthly rent of approximately  that expires in september following the closure of the waltham office in december  we have sublet this property until october at a mo nthly rent of approximately  we also make royalty payments to the institutions who participated in the original research that produced our initial products 
our minimum royalty payments are  per year

application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements would be affected 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts are the most critical assumptions to understand in order to evaluate our reported financial results 
a detailed discussion of our use of estimates  assumptions and judgments as they relate to these polices is presented below 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of licenses to our software and from service and support fees 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with the rules governing revenue recognition for software companies 
these rules provide specific industry guidance and four basic criteria  which must be met to recognize revenue 
these are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  a fixed or determinable fee  and the probability that the fee will be collected 
the application of these rules requires us to exercise significant judgment related to our specific transactions and transaction types 
in cases where we grant extended payment terms to school customers  we determine if the fixed or determinable fee criterion is met by reference to the customer s specifi c funding sources  especially where the payment terms extend into the customer s next fiscal year 
if we determine that the fixed or determinable fee criterion is not met at the inception of the arrangement  we defer revenue recognition until the payments become due 
sales to our school customers typically include multiple elements eg  fast forword software licenses  progress tracker  our internet based participant tracking service  support  training  implementation management  and other services 
we recognize revenue using the residual method  whereby the difference between the total arrangement fee and the total vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue relating to the delivered elements 
vsoe of fair value for each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is also measured by the renewal price 
we are r equired to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
the value of software licenses  services and support invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenue until recognized 
all revenue from transactions that include new products that have not yet been delivered is deferred until the delivery of all products 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as discussed below 
multiple contracts with the same customer are generally accounted for as separate arrangements except in cases where contracts are so closely related that they are effectively part of a single arrangement 

table of contents product revenue product revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of software and is recognized as follows perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis 
revenue is recognized at the later of product delivery date or contract start date using the residual method 
if vsoe does not exist for all the undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period if the undelivered element is services or when all elements have been delivered 
term licenses software licensed for a specific time period  generally three to twelve months 
revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
individual participant licenses software licensed for a single participant 
revenue is recognized over the average period of use  typically six weeks 
service and support revenue service and support revenue is derived from a combination of training  implementation  technical and professional services  online services and customer support 
training  technical and other professional services are typically sold on a per day basis 
if vsoe exists for all elements of an arrangement or all elements except software licenses  services revenue is recognized as performed 
if vsoe does not exist for all the elements in an arrangement except software licenses  service revenue is recognized over the longest contractual period in an arrangement 
revenue from services sold alone or with support is recognized as performed 
if an arrangement includes services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize the fees for the software license and the services using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the rules relating to contract accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated hours to complete the project 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves an estimation process and is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future events 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including the nature of the services being performed  the complexity of the customer s information technology environment and the utilization and efficiency of our professional services employees 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal and state operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage our business 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc  we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate stock based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
the estimated expected stock price volatility increased from in to in and increased again to in our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options is based upon our historical experience over the expected life of the options 

table of contents our estimate of the forfeiture rate has also changed from in to in to in  based on our experience of actual forfeiture rates 
stock compensation expense may be adjusted in the future if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our current estimates 
capitalization of software development costs and website development costs 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  in we capitalized approximately  of costs relating to a new reading assistant product incurred after this product t had reached technological feasibility 
the rules that govern how development costs are accounted for can have a major impact on our reported financial results 
significant judgment is required in assessing whether and when products have reached technological feasibility 
we are also required to use judgment to estimate the net realizable value of the asset by projecting future revenues and cash flows expected to be generated by the products  in order to determine whether the unamortized cost exceed the net realizable value 
moreover  any future changes to our software product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a signif icant impact on our financial results 
we also capitalize web site application  infrastructure development and content development costs where a website is built for our internal needs and we do not plan to market the software externally  for the years ended december  and  respectively  we capitalized approximately  and  in web site development costs 
if indicators of impairment are present  estimates of future cash flows are used to test the recoverability of the web site asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized 
in late we determined that we needed to completely redesign our brainspark website and accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of  significant judgment is required in evaluating which costs are eligible for capitalization and whether a ny impairment exists 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the rate of interest that we earn on our cash and cash equivalents 
we did not hold any marketable debt securities at december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not have a material effect on our results of operations
