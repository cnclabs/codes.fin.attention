accordingly  we have organized a number of wholly owned subsidiary corporations  and iret properties has organized several limited partnerships  for the purpose of holding title in an entity that complies with such lending conditions 
all financial statements of these subsidiaries are consolidated into our financial statements 
management and leasing of our real estate assets we conduct our corporate operations from offices in minot  north dakota and minneapolis  minnesota 
we also have property management offices in an additional seven locations in minnesota  north dakota  nebraska  kansas and missouri 
the day to day management of our commercial properties is carried out by our own employees and by third party property management companies 
in markets where the amount of rentable square footage we own does not justify self management  when properties acquired have effective pre existing property management in place  or when for other reasons particular properties are in our judgment not attractive candidates for self management  we utilize third party professional management companies for day to day management 
however  all decisions relating to purchase  sale  insurance coverage  ca pital improvements  approval of commercial leases  annual operating budgets and major renovations are made exclusively by our employees and implemented by the third party management companies 
the management and leasing of our multi family residential properties previously was generally handled by locally based  third party management companies  but during fiscal year we began implementing our previously announced plan to transfer the management of the majority of our multi family residential properties to our own employees 
as of april   we have under internal management commercial properties and multi family residential properties 
our remaining commercial and multi family residential properties are managed by third parties 
we plan to continue evaluating our portfolio to identify other commercial properties and multi family properties that may be candidates for management by our own employees

we operate on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended april  overview we are a self advised equity real estate investment trust engaged in owning and operating income producing real properties 
our investments include multi family residential properties and commercial properties located primarily in the upper midwest states of minnesota and north dakota 
our properties are diversified in property type and location 
as of april   our real estate portfolio consisted of multi family residential properties containing  apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of billion 
our commercial properties consist of commercial office properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  
index annual report commercial medical properties including senior housing containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  commercial industrial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial retail properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million 
our primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multi family residential and commercial leases 
our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy 
this strategy is focused on growing assets in desired geographical markets  achieving diversification by property type and location  and adhering to targeted returns in acquiring properties 
total revenues of iret properties  our operating partnership  increased by million to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new real estate properties 
we estimate that rent concessions offered to tenants during the twelve months ended april  lowered our operating revenues by approximately million  compared to million for fiscal year expenses increased during fiscal year  with real estate taxes  insurance  maintenance and property management expense all increasing from year earlier levels 
on an all property basis  physical occupancy levels in our total commercial property segments decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year physical occupancy rates in our commercial medical segment increased  physical occupancy in our commercial office  commercial industrial and commercial retail segments decreased 
physical occupancy in our multi family residential segment decreased to in fiscal year on an all property basis  from in fiscal year during fiscal year  we continued to pursue our announced goal of transferring the management of the majority of our commercial and multi family residential properties from third party property management companies to our own employees 
as of april   the company had under internal management a total of properties in its commercial office  commercial medical  commercial industrial and commercial retail segments  totaling approximately million square feet 
approximately of the properties in the company s commercial office segment  of the properties in its commercial medical segment  of the properties in its commercial industrial segment  and of the properties in its commercial retail segment  were internally managed by company employees as of april  iret continues to evalua te its portfolio of commercial properties to determine additional suitable candidates for internal management  and to establish appropriate timelines to accomplish the transfers 
the transition to internal management in the company s multi family residential segment was a significant focus of company resources and management efforts during fiscal year as of april   approximately of the properties in the company s multi family residential segment were internally managed by company employees  or approximately  units in properties 
during fiscal year  the company added a significant number of new employees  many of whom were hired to work in multi family residential property management 
as of april   the company had employees  of which were full time and part time employees  of these employees  are corporate staff in our minot  north dakota and eden prairie  minnesota offices  and are property management employees based at our propert ies or in local property management offices 
these additions to staff  and associated investments in equipment  accounting and other support systems  represent a significant expense to the company  which is reflected in an increase in property management expense attributable to the company s internal property management initiative of approximately million for the twelve months ended april   primarily in the multi family residential segment 
iret s fiscal year results reflect the continuing challenges the real estate industry faced during the twelve months ended april   and worsening conditions in iret s multi family residential segment in particular 
during the year  factors adversely affecting demand for iret s commercial and multi family properties continued to be pervasive across the united states and in iret s markets  with commercial tenants continuing to focus on reducing costs through space reductions and lower rents 
additionally  continued job losses pressured occupancy and revenue in the company s multi family residential segment 
we expect current credit market 
index annual report conditions and the continued high level of unemployment to maintain or increase credit stresses on company tenants  and continue to expect this tenant stress to lead to increases in past due accounts and vacancies 
additional information and more detailed discussions of our fiscal year operating results are found in the following sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
real estate 
real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment for impairment  if any 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
as described further below  the process of allocating property costs to its components involves a considerable amount of subjective judgments to be made by company management 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a year estimated life for buildings a nd improvements and a year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and improvements that improve and or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life  generally five to ten years 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets including land  buildings and personal property  which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and considers whether there were significant intangible assets acquired for example  above and below market leases  the value of acquired in place leases  and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities  and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land  buildings  and personal property based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
the estimated fair value of the property is the amount that would be recoverable upon the disposition of the property 
techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and reference to recent sales of comparable properties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on estimated market value if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are estimated based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the company performs this analysis on a lease by lease basis 
the capitalized above market or below market intangible is amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based upon the company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the company also considers information about each property obtained during its pre acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration is received by the company and the company has no significant continuing involvement with the property sold 
impairment 
the company s long lived assets are reviewed for impairment quarterly if events or changes in circumstances such as adverse market conditions  including conditions resulting from an ongoing economic recession indicate that a long lived asset might be impaired 
judgments regarding existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and events that occur that affect the financial strength of significant tenants of the assets  including tenants who have filed for bankruptcy 
for long lived assets in which an impairment indicator is present  the company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long lived asset against the carrying amount of the asset  including any associated intangibles  subject to evaluation 
the evaluation of undiscounted cash flows is subjective 
index annual report and reflects assumptions regarding current market conditions relative to the long lived asset being evaluated  such as future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements 
a worsening real estate market may cause the company to re evaluate the assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
if there is an indication of impairment based on this evaluation  possible impairment is evaluated based on the estimated fair value typically based on a current independent appraisal of the long lived asset in comparison to its carrying value 
the results of the company s evaluation of impairment analysis could be material to the company s financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts approximately  as of april  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents approximately  as of april  and from mortgage loans approximately  as of april  
the straight lining of rents receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current cre dit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent increases and abated rent under the leases 
certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the company records a receivable from tenants for rents that it expects to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable 
when the company acquires a property  the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation 
revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluatio n of the reliability of such deferred rents receivable involves management s assumptions relating to such tenant s viability 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
expense reimbursement income revenue arising from tenant leases  which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
income taxes 
the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
the company has one trs  acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular statutory rates 
for fiscal year  the company s trs had a small net operating loss 
there were no income tax provisions or material deferred income tax items for our trs for the fiscal year ended april  the company s trs is the tenant in the company s wyoming assisted living facilities

results of operations revenues total revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year revenues during fiscal year were million greater than revenues in fiscal year and revenues during fiscal year were million greater than in fiscal year for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent in fiscal from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year decrease in rental income on stabilized properties due primarily to a decrease in occupancy in all segments for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year increase in rental income on stabilized properties due primarily to increase in rents in our multi family residential and commercial medical segments as illustrated above  the majority of the increase in our gross revenue for fiscal years and million and million respectively resulted from the addition of new real estate properties to the iret properties portfolio 
rental revenue in fiscal year from stabilized properties decreased million  while fiscal year resulted in an increase in these same stabilized properties of million 
for the next months  we continue to look to acquisitions of new properties and recovery in our stabilized portfolio to be the most significant factors in any increases in our revenues and ultimately our net income 
however  we have not observed any marked and sustained decline in the prices at which investment properties are offered for sale  which  combined with the general lack of improvement in operating fundamentals  makes identifying attractive acquisition possibilities a continuing challenge 
additionally  financial markets continue to experience volatility and uncertainty  with liquidity continuing to be constrained in the debt markets in particular 
consequently  there is ongoing uncertainty regarding our ability to identify acquisition targets and to access the credit markets in order to attract financing on reasonable terms  and our ability to make acquisitions accordingly could be adversely affected 
gain on sale of real estate the company realized a gain on sale of real estate  land and other investments for fiscal year of approximately  this compares to approximately  of gain on sale of real estate recognized in fiscal and approximately  recognized in fiscal net operating income the following tables report segment financial information 
we measure the performance of our segments based on net operating income noi  which we define as total real estate revenues less real estate expenses and real estate taxes excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate investments and impairment of real estate investments 
we believe that noi is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit s operating real estate because it provides a measure of core operations that is unaffected by depreciation  
index annual report amortization  financing and general and administrative expense 
noi does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income  net income available for common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance 
the following tables show real estate revenues  real estate operating expenses and noi by reportable operating segment for fiscal years  and for a reconciliation of net operating income of reportable segments to operating income as reported  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the tables also show net operating income by reportable operating segment on a stabilized property and non stabilized property basis 
stabilized properties are properties owned and in operation for the entirety of the periods being compared including properties that were redeveloped or expanded during the periods being compared  with properties purchased or sold during the periods being compared excluded from the stabilized property category 
this comparison allows the company to evaluate the performance of existing properties and their contribution to net income 
management believes that measuring performance on a stabilized property basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how the company s properties are performing year over year 
management uses this measure t o assess whether or not it has been successful in increasing net operating income  renewing the leases of existing tenants  controlling operating costs and appropriately handling capital improvements

funds from operations iret considers funds from operations ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit 
iret uses the definition of ffo adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit in  as clarified in  and nareit defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
because of limitations of the ffo definition adopted by nareit  iret has made certain interpretations in applying the definition 
 iret believes all such interpretations not specifically provided for in the nareit definition are consistent with the definition 

index annual report iret management considers that ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  is useful to investors in providing an additional perspective on iret s operating results 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation  that the value of real estate assets decreases predictably over time 
however  real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
nareit s definition of ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  reflects the fact that depreciation charges required by gaap may not reflect underlying economic realities 
additionally  the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from t he sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  allows iret management and investors to better identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of iret s investments  and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
ffo is used by iret s management and investors to identify trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
while ffo is widely used by reits as a primary performance metric  not all real estate companies use the same definition of ffo or calculate ffo in the same way 
accordingly  ffo presented here is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of iret s performance  but rather should be considered as an additional  supplemental measure  and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of iret s needs or its ability to service indebtedness or make distributions 
ffo applicable to common shares and limited partnership units for the fiscal year ended april  decreased to million  compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended april  and  respectively 
the decrease in ffo was due to those factors discussed above in the sections titled changes in expenses and net income and factors impacting net income during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year reconciliation of net income attributable to investors real estate trust to funds from operations for the years ended april   and in thousands  except per share and unit amounts fiscal years ended april  amount weighted avg shares and units per share and unit amount weighted avg shares and units per share and unit amount weighted avg shares and units per share and unit net income attributable to investors real estate trust less dividends to preferred shareholders net income available to common shareholders adjustments noncontrolling interests operating partnership depreciation and amortization gains on depreciable property sales funds from operations applicable to common shares and units real estate depreciation and amortization consists of the sum of depreciation amortization related to real estate investments and amortization related to non real estate investments from the consolidated statements of operations  totaling   and  and depreciation amortization from discontinued operations of  and  less corporate related depreciation and amortization on office equipment and other assets of  and for the fiscal year ended april   and upreit units of the operating partnership are exchangeable for common shares of beneficial interest on a one for one basis

index annual report cash distributions the following cash distributions were paid to our common shareholders and upreit unitholders during fiscal years  and fiscal years quarters first second third fourth the fiscal year cash distributions increased over the cash distributions paid during fiscal year  and fiscal year cash distributions increased over the cash distributions paid during fiscal year liquidity and capital resources overview the company s principal liquidity demands are maintaining distributions to the holders of the company s common and preferred shares of beneficial interest and upreit units  capital improvements and repairs and maintenance to the company s properties  acquisition of additional properties  property development  tenant improvements and debt service and repayments 
the company has historically met its short term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by its operating activities  and  from time to time  through draws on its unsecured lines of credit 
management considers the company s ability to generate cash from property operating activities  cash out refinancing of existing properties and  from time to time  draws on its line of credit to be adequate to meet all operating requirements and to make distributions to its shareholders in accordance with the reit provisions of the internal revenue code 
budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations to our real estate portfolio are also generally expected to be funded from existing cash on hand  cash flow generated from property operations  cash out refinancing of existing properties  and or new borrowings 
however  the commercial and residential real estate markets continue to experience significant challenges including reduced occupancies and rental rates as well as severe restrictions on the availability of financing 
in the event of further deterioration in property operating results  or absent the company s ability to successfully continue cash out refinancing of existing properties and or new borrowings  the company may need to consider additional cash preservation alternatives  including scaling back development activities  capital improvements and renovations and reducing the level of distributions to shareholders 
at its regularly scheduled meeting in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company s board of trustees thought it prudent  given the current economic environment and the challenges facing the real estate industry in particular  to maintain the company s common share unit distribution at its current level per share unit  rather t han continue the small quarterly increases in the distribution that had previously been the company s practice 
company management and the board continue to monitor closely the company s operating results  in particular cash flows from operations  which are an important factor in the company s ability to sustain its distribution at its current rate 
for the fiscal year ended april   we paid distributions of million in cash and million in common shares pursuant to our drip to common shareholders and unitholders of the operating partnership  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and funds from operations of million 
the company cannot rule out the need in future for a reduction in the current amount of the distribution paid on the company s common shares and units 
to the extent the company does not satisfy its long term liquidity requirements  which consist primarily of maturities under the company s long term debt  construction and development activities and potential acquisition opportunities  through net cash flows provided by operating activities and its credit facilities  the company intends to satisfy such requirements through a combination of funding sources which the company believes will be available to it  including the issuance of upreit units  additional common or preferred equity  proceeds from the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured indebtedness 
however  our ability to raise funds through the sale of equity securities  the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured borrowings is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  our operating performance  and the current trading price of our common shares  and the capital and debt markets 
index annual report may not consistently be available at all or on terms that we consider attractive 
in particular  as a result of the continuing economic downturn and turmoil in the capital markets  the availability of secured and unsecured loans has been sharply curtailed 
we cannot predict how long these conditions will continue 
as a result of general economic conditions in our markets  economic downturns affecting the ability to attract and retain tenants  unfavorable fluctuations in interest rates or our share price  unfavorable changes in the supply of competing properties  or our properties not performing as expected  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we may not be able to pay the distribution required t o maintain our status as a reit  make required principal and interest payments  make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements or undertake re development opportunities with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset values

iret obtains a majority of its multi family debt from primarily freddie mac
