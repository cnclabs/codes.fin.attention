this report contains or incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include statements about our future and statements that are not historical facts 
these forward looking statements are usually preceded by the words believe  intend  may  will  or similar expressions 
forward looking statements may contain expectations regarding revenues  earnings  operations and other financial projections  and may include statements of future performance  plans and objectives 
forward looking statements also include statements pertaining to our strategies for future development of our business and products 
forward looking statements represent only our belief regarding future events  many of which by their nature are inherently uncertain 
it is possible that the actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the anticipated results indicated in these forward looking statements 
information regarding important factors that could cause actual results to differ  perhaps materially  from those in our forward looking statements is contained in this report and other documents we file

we will not update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results can and will differ from estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
current economic conditions increased the risks and complexity of the judgments in these estimates 

table of contents we believe our application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly re evaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our management believes our critical accounting policies policies that are both material to the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or complex judgments are our valuation of financial instruments  goodwill and our use of estimates related to compensation and benefits during the year 
for further discussion of these and other significant accounting policies  see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of financial instruments financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
unrealized gains or losses are generally recognized in principal transactions in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the following is a summary of the fair value of major categories of financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  as of december  and in thousands of dollars december  december  financial financial instruments instruments financial sold  financial sold  instruments not yet instruments not yet owned purchased owned purchased corporate equity securities corporate debt securities government  federal agency and other sovereign obligations mortgage and asset backed securities loans and other receivables derivatives investments other a portion of our mortgage and asset backed securities inventory has been economically hedged through the forward sale of such securities with the execution of to be announced tba securities with a notional amount outstanding of  million and million at december  and  respectively 
tba securities had a net asset fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively  and are included in mortgage and asset backed securities in our consolidated statement of financial condition 
fair value hierarchy in determining fair value  we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
we apply a hierarchy to categorize our fair value measurements broken down into three levels based on the transparency of inputs as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date 
the nature of these financial instruments include cash 
table of contents instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently  derivative instruments whose fair value have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market  or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments  the parameters of which can be directly observed 
level instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date 
these financial instruments do not have two way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation 
the availability of observable inputs can vary for different products 
fair value is a market based measure  therefore  when market observable inputs are not available  our judgment is applied to reflect those judgments that a market participant would use in valuing the same asset or liability 
we use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date even in periods of market disruption or illiquidity 
greater judgment in valuation is required when inputs are less observable or unobservable in the marketplace and judgment must be applied in determining the appropriateness of available prices  particularly in assessing whether available data reflects current prices and or reflects the results of recent market transactions 
the valuation of financial instruments classified in level of the fair value hierarchy involves the greatest amount of management judgment 
greater use of management judgment is required in determining fair value when the volume or level of trading activity for a financial instrument has decreased and when certain factors suggest that observed transactions may not be reflective of orderly market transactions 
prices or quotes are weighed when estimating fair value with greater reliability placed on information from transactions that are considered to be representative of orderly market transactions 
valuation process for financial instruments financial instruments are valued at quoted market prices  if available 
for financial instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values through quoted market prices  the determination of fair value is based upon consideration of available information  including current financial information  restrictions on dispositions  fair values of underlying financial instruments and quotations for similar instruments 
certain financial instruments have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace 
for financial instruments whose inputs are based on bid ask prices  mid market pricing is applied and adjusted to the point within the bid ask range that meets our best estimate of fair value 
for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument  the same price within the bid ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions 
the valuation process for financial instruments may include the use of valuation models and other techniques 
adjustments to valuations derived from valuation models may be made when  in management s judgment  either the size of the position in the financial instrument in a non active market or other features of the financial instrument such as its complexity  or the market in which the financial instrument is traded require that an adjustment be made to the value derived from the models 
an adjustment may be made if a financial instrument is subject to sales restrictions that would result in a price less than the quoted market price 
adjustments from the price derived from a valuation model reflect management s judgment that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would also consider in valuing that same financial instrument and are adjusted for assumptions about risk uncertainties and market conditions 
results from valuation models and valuation techniques in one period may not be indicative of future period fair value measurements 
cash products where quoted prices are available in an active market  cash products are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy and valued based on the quoted exchange price  which is generally obtained from pricing services 
level cash products are highly liquid instruments and include listed equity and money market securities and g government and agency securities 
cash products classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are based primarily on broker quotations  pricing service data from external providers and prices observed for recently executed market transactions 
if quoted market prices are not available for the specific security  then fair values are estimated by using pricing models  quoted prices of cash products with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models 
examples of cash products classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are corporate  convertible and municipal bonds  agency and non agency mortgage backed securities and to be announced tba securities 
if there is limited transaction activity or less transparency to observe market based inputs to valuation models  cash products presented at fair value are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
fair values of cash products classified in level are generally based on an assessment of each underlying investment  cash flow models  market data of any recent comparable company transactions and trading multiples of companies 
table of contents considered comparable to the instrument being valued and incorporate assumptions regarding market outlook  among other factors 
additionally  investments in entities that have the characteristic of an investment company are valued based on the investments net asset value calculated based on the fair value of an entity s underlying assets and liabilities unless the investment is held in a trading portfolio 
cash products in this category include illiquid equity securities  equity interests in private companies  auction rate securities  commercial loans  private equity and hedge fund investments  distressed debt instruments and certain mortgage backed securities as little external price information is currently available for these products 
for distressed debt instruments and commercial loans  loss assumptions must be made based on default scenarios and market liquidity and prepayment assumptions must be made for mortgage backed securities 
derivative products exchange traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices  which are generally obtained from pricing services  and are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
over the counter otc derivative products are generally valued using models  whose inputs reflect assumptions that we believe market participants would use in valuing the derivative in a current period transaction 
inputs to valuation models are appropriately calibrated to market data  including  but not limited to  yield curves  interest rates  volatilities  equity  debt and commodity prices and credit curves 
fair value can be modeled using a series of techniques  including the black scholes option pricing model and other comparable simulation models 
for certain otc derivative contracts  inputs to valuation models do not involve a high degree of subjectivity as the valuation model inputs are readily observable or can be derived from actively quoted markets 
otc derivative contracts classified in level include credit default swaps  interest rate swaps  foreign currency forwards  commodity swaps and option contracts  and debt and equity option contracts 
derivative products that are valued based on models with significant unobservable market inputs are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
level derivative products include total return swaps and equity warrant and option contracts where the volatility of the underlying equity securities is not observable due to the terms of the contracts and the correlation sensitivity to market indices is not transparent for the term of the derivatives 
at december  and  the measurements of our cash products and derivative products at fair value were based on the following financial financial valuation basis at instruments instruments sold  december  owned not yet purchased exchange closing prices recently observed transaction prices data providers pricing services broker quotes valuation techniques financial financial valuation basis at instruments instruments sold  december  owned not yet purchased exchange closing prices recently observed transaction prices data providers pricing services broker quotes valuation techniques pricing information obtained from external data providers may incorporate a range of market quotes from dealers  recent market transactions and benchmarking model derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for comparable securities 
external pricing data is subject to evaluation for reasonableness using a variety of means including comparisons of prices to those of similar product types  quality and maturities  consideration of the 
table of contents narrowness or wideness of the range of prices obtained  knowledge of recent market transactions and an assessment of the similarity in prices to comparable dealer offerings in a recent time period 
certain cash products and derivative products trade infrequently and therefore have little price transparency 
as a result  we may use alternative valuation techniques or valuation models as methods for determining fair value 
when using alternative valuation techniques or valuation models  the following techniques are applied to different financial instruments classes financial instrument classes valuation techniques equity securities and convertible bonds valuations based on pending transactions involving the issuer or comparable companies  subsequent financings or recapitalizations  changes in financial ratios and cash flows of the underlying issuer and prices of comparable securities high yield corporate bonds valuations based on pending transactions involving the issuer or comparable companies  subsequent financings or recapitalizations  changes in financial ratios and cash flows of the underlying issuer and prices of comparable securities non agency mortgage backed and other asset backed securities benchmarked to yields from market prices for comparable securities and calibrated based on expected cash flow characteristics of the underlying assets auction rate securities benchmarked to transactions and market prices of comparable securities and adjusted for projected cash flows and security structure  where appropriate corporate bank and other commercial loans and other receivables references to prices for other debt instruments of the same issuer  estimates of expected future cash flows incorporating assumptions regarding creditor default and or recovery investments in hedge funds  funds of funds and certain private equity funds net asset values investments in certain private equity funds discounted cash flow techniques otc equity and commodity options and equity warrants black scholes and comparable simulation models interest rate  credit default  commodity and total return swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts modeling  primarily involving discounted cash flows  which incorporate observable inputs related to interest rate curves  commodity indices  equity prices and volatilities  foreign currency spot curves and credit spreads of the underlying credit prior to the second quarter of  a valuation technique utilizing an internal methodology based on projected cash flows discounted for lack of liquidity was applied in determining fair value 
prior to the fourth quarter of  net asset values of investments used for determining fair value were adjusted for redemption restrictions where appropriate 
upon the adoption of accounting standard update on october   no adjustments are made to reported net asset values for these investments 
the impact of this change was not material to the valuation of this asset class on october  
table of contents level assets and liabilities total level assets were million and million as of december  and  respectively  and represented approximately and  respectively  of total assets measured at fair value 
level assets  for which the firm bears no economic exposure  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
level liabilities were million and million as of december  and  respectively  and represented approximately and  respectively  of total liabilities measured at fair value 
while our financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  which are included within liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition  are accounted for at fair value  we do not account for any of our other liabilities at fair value 
at december  and  level financial instruments were comprised of the following asset and liability classes financial instruments sold  financial instruments owned not yet purchased december  december  december  december  in thousands loans and other receivables mortgage and asset backed securities corporate debt securities investments auction rate securities corporate equity securities collateralized debt obligations derivatives foreign government issued securities total level financial instruments level financial instruments for which the firm bears no economic exposure level financial instruments for which the firm bears economic exposure during the year ended december   we had transfers of assets of million from level to level and transfers of million from level to level transfers of assets from level to level during the year ended december  were primarily related to corporate debt securities where observable transaction data became less available for the specific class of securities in inventory that were transferred  some high yield corporate bond positions as market quotes became less observable as of the third quarter due to less frequent or nominal market activity and the opaqueness of observable credit spreads  and residential mortgage backed securities where observable transaction data became less observable 
transfers of assets from level to level for the year ended december  were primarily related to high yield corporate bonds for which pricing information  including observed trading activity and recently executed transactions  provided transparency for purposes of determining fair values  and residential mortgage backed securities and government insured mortgage loans 
during the year ended december   we had transfers of liabilities of million from level to level and transfers of liabilities of million from level to level net gains on level assets of million for the year ended december  are attributed primarily to increases in the fair value of certain mortgage backed securities  partially offset by equity warrants and certain equity securities due to declining underlying equity prices and increased market volatility  declines in the pricing for certain corporate debt securities and net writedowns on auction rate securities as market based pricing levels and redemptions dampened in the second quarter of net gains on level liabilities were million for the year ended december  level cash instruments are frequently hedged with instruments classified within level and level  and accordingly  gains or losses that have been reported in level are frequently offset by gains or losses attributable to instruments classified within level or level or by gains or losses on derivative contracts classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents see note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the classification of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
controls over the valuation process for financial instruments our valuation team  independent of the trading function  plays an important role in determining that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable 
this is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable 
in the event that observable inputs are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable 
where a pricing model is used to determine fair value  these control processes include reviews of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks 
in addition  recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model 
goodwill as a result of acquisitions  we have acquired goodwill 
our goodwill balance of million at december  is wholly attributed to our capital markets segment  which is our reporting unit 
at least annually  we are required to assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the operating segment with its net book value 
periodically estimating the fair value of the capital markets segment requires significant judgment 
we estimate the fair value of the operating segment based on valuation methodologies we believe market participants would use  including consideration of control premiums for recent acquisitions observed in the marketplace 
we completed our annual impairment test as of september  and no impairment was identified 
compensation and benefits the use of estimates is important in determining compensation and benefits expenses for interim periods 
a portion of our compensation and benefits represents discretionary bonuses  which are finalized at year end 
in addition to the level of net revenues  our overall compensation expense in any given year is influenced by prevailing labor markets  revenue mix  profitability  individual and business performance metrics  and our use of share based compensation programs 
we believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated annual total compensation among interim periods is in proportion to projected net revenues earned 
consequently  during the year we accrue compensation and benefits based on annual targeted compensation ratios  taking into account the timing of expense recognition 
our fourth quarter of reflects the actual total compensation and benefits we expect to pay for the full year

the capital markets reportable segment is managed as a single operating segment that provides the sales  trading and origination effort for various equity  fixed income  and high yield products and advisory services 
the capital markets segment comprises many businesses  with many interactions among them 
in addition  we choose to voluntarily disclose the asset management segment  even though it is currently an immaterial non reportable segment 
for presentation purposes  the remainder of results of operations is presented on a detailed product and expense basis rather than on a business segment basis because the asset management segment is immaterial as compared to the consolidated results of operations

net revenues v 
net revenues for the year ended december  were a record  million  more than double net revenues of  million 
the increase was primarily due to increases of in fixed income and commodities revenues  in investment banking revenues and in asset management revenues and an increase in high yield revenues to million in from negative revenues of million in as we enhanced and developed our diversified businesses throughout  partially offset by a decline in equities revenues as compared with the prior year

total equities revenues were million and million  respectively  in and  representing a decrease from the decrease in equities revenues as compared to was primarily driven by declines in revenues from our us cash equities and securities lending businesses and declines in the trading results from certain principal equity trading strategies  which performed particularly well given market volatility in the decrease in revenues generated by our cash equities business is reflective of a decrease in customer trading volume  some of which reflects the direction of customer flow to electronic trading activities  and the decline in revenues generated by our securities lending business is primarily attributed to the low short term interest rates prevailing throughout the year 
revenues from prime brokerage services and electronic trading activities were up as compared to as market share and customer balances continued to grow

corporate bond revenues were up substantially over the prior comparable period benefiting from continued growth in market share and record volume for the year 
this resulted in increased principal transactions trading revenues  predominantly arising from customer flow business  partially muted by tightening credit spreads in the latter part of significant increases in mortgage backed securities revenues were driven by higher levels of customer

the decline in assets under management for the year ended december  is primarily due to customer redemptions from our global convertible bond funds and net market depreciation in our managed clos and other fixed income funds and our global convertible bond funds due to the deteriorating credit market conditions experienced in we manage certain portfolios as mandated by client arrangements and management fees are assessed based upon an agreed upon notional account value

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits totaled  million   million and million in  and  respectively 
compensation and benefits expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  cash bonuses  commissions and the amortization of share based compensation to employees 
employees totaled approximately   and  at december   and  respectively 
in december  we implemented a new overall compensation strategy that modified the terms of all then outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock unit rsus awards of active employees and of future restricted stock and rsus granted as part of year end bonus compensation 
we modified all then outstanding awards such that employees who terminate their employment or are terminated without cause may continue to vest  so long as the awards are not forfeited as a result of other forfeiture provisions of those awards 
under the approved compensation strategy  our practice is that all awards granted as part of year end compensation contain these provisions 
we believe these provisions incorporated in our share based compensation better manage our employee compensation expense with the related production of revenues by our businesses 
v 
compensation and benefits expense totaled  million for the year ended december   a ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues of 
this is in comparison to compensation and benefits expense of  million for the year ended december   with a ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues of 
the decrease in compensation and benefits expense in as compared to is primarily the result of expensing in share based compensation awarded to employees in previous years of approximately million  expenses associated with share based compensation awards granted to employees in december of approximately million  expenses in associated with the modification of outstanding employee loans of approximately million  and severance costs incurred during of million 
these factors that contributed to the net decline in compensation and benefits expense in as compared to are partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits expense during due to added revenue from our expanding fixed income and equity businesses and increased staffing levels both domestically and internationally in connection with our business growth 
compensation and benefits expense in includes the cost of of the fair value of restricted stock and rsus granted to employees other than our two most senior executive officers as part of year end bonus compensation 
the impact of bank payroll tax legislation proposed by the uk and other foreign governments has not been accrued for in  but rather will be expensed in  if enacted  however  our compensation levels were lowered to absorb this potential future cost

compensation and benefits expense of  million for the year ended december  includes the cost of expensing in share based compensation awarded to employees in previous years of approximately million  expenses associated with share based compensation awards granted to employees in december of approximately million  expenses associated with the modification of outstanding employee loans of approximately million  and severance costs incurred during of million 
excluding these items  compensation and benefits expense totaled  million for compensation and benefits expense of million for the year ended december  includes amortization expense associated with share based compensation awards of million  which relates to share based compensation awards granted in and previous years 
as a result of the removal of the service requirements in connection with the approval of our overall compensation strategy  we accelerated the expensing of any remaining unamortized share based compensation costs in december with respect to previously granted awards on the modification date  with a total compensation cost of million 
prior to this modification  restricted stock and rsus awarded to employees were generally subject to continued service and employment requirements with the grant date fair value of these awards amortized as compensation expense over the required service period  which was typically five years 
as part of our annual compensation process  we granted approximately million shares of restricted stock and rsus to employees in december as these year end awards contain termination provisions comparable to 
table of contents the terms of the overall approved compensation strategy  we recognized the full grant date fair value expense associated with these restricted stock and rsus awards of million immediately upon grant date in the current year 
excluding the impact of modifications to our share based compensation awards and severance costs  the higher ratio of compensation expense to net revenues for as compared to results primarily from weaker than anticipated revenue production from certain business lines in which a minimum level of compensation costs are necessary in order to maintain appropriate personnel levels for competitiveness  as well as commission based compensation paid in respect of revenue production in certain divisions where revenues include substantial trading losses 
additionally  while we sizably reduced our employee headcount as of december  as compared to the beginning of  during we made significant hires both domestically and internationally in connection with expanding our mortgage  corporate bond and international equity trading capabilities  which temporarily increases compensation costs as production revenues build

non compensation expenses were million for  a decrease as compared to  which reflects an increase in floor brokerage and clearing fees due to the level of trading volume throughout most of and increased technology and communications costs as the expansion of our personnel and business platforms has increased the demand for market data and technology connections 
increases in floor brokerage and clearing fees and technology and communication costs are offset by lower business development expenses and other expenses as a result of the cost reduction initiatives enacted at the end of additionally  the decline in other expenses in comparing to is primarily attributed to losses within other expenses in the second half of incurred in connection with unwinding certain securities lending transactions with lehman brothers and landsbankinn as counterparties and other credit losses attributed to exposures from lehman brothers

these policies are determined by the nature and needs of our day to day business operations  business opportunities  regulatory obligations  and liquidity requirements 
market conditions  which had been volatile throughout  began to stabilize in the second quarter of  resulting in some tightening of credit spreads and improvements in market liquidity 
the availability of financing sources improved as progressed 
during the year ended december   we issued million in ten year notes and million in convertible senior debentures 
our long term debt has an average tenor of years  we have no scheduled debt maturities until  and we have no short term borrowings and significant cash balances on hand 
we continue to actively manage our liquidity profile and counterparty relationships to ensure ongoing access to both short and longer term funding 

table of contents our actual level of capital  total assets  and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors  including  asset composition  business initiatives and opportunities  regulatory requirements and cost availability of both long term and short term funding 
we have historically maintained a highly liquid balance sheet  with a substantial portion of our total assets consisting of cash  liquid marketable securities and short term receivables  arising principally from traditional securities brokerage activity 
the liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business

a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash or assets readily convertible into cash 
the majority of securities positions both long and short in our trading accounts are readily marketable and actively traded 
in addition  receivables from brokers and dealers are primarily current open transactions  margin deposits or securities borrowed transactions  which are typically settled or closed out within a few days 
receivable from customers includes margin balances and amounts due on transactions in the process of settlement 
most of our receivables are secured by marketable securities 
our assets are funded by equity capital  senior debt  convertible debt  mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock  mandatorily redeemable preferred interests  securities loaned  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  customer free credit balances  bank loans and other payables 
bank loans represent temporary usually overnight secured and unsecured short term borrowings  which are generally payable on demand and generally bear interest at a spread over the federal funds rate 
unsecured bank loans are typically overnight loans used to finance financial instruments owned or clearing related balances 
we had no outstanding secured or unsecured bank loans as of december  and average daily bank loans for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we have arrangements with various banks for financing of up to  million  including million of bank loans and million of letters of credit 
of the  million of uncommitted lines of credit  million is unsecured and million is secured 
secured amounts are collateralized by a combination of customer  non customer and firm securities 
letters of credit are used in the normal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities 
liquidity management policies the primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding over a range of market environments 
the key objectives of the liquidity management framework are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial 
table of contents distress 
our liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material franchise or business impact 
the principal elements of our liquidity management framework are the funding action plan and the cash capital policy 
funding action plan 
the funding action plan models a potential liquidity contraction over a one year time period 
our funding action plan model scenarios incorporate potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event  including  but not limited to  the following a repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance  b maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral  c higher margin requirements on or lower availability of secured funding  d client cash withdrawals  e the anticipated funding of outstanding investment commitments and f certain accrued expenses and other liabilities and fixed costs 
cash capital policy 
we maintain a cash capital model that measures long term funding sources against requirements 
sources of cash capital include our equity  preferred stock and the non current portion of long term borrowings 
uses of cash capital include the following a illiquid assets such as buildings  equipment  goodwill  net intangible assets  exchange memberships  deferred tax assets and certain investments  b a portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment ie  margin requirements and c drawdowns of unfunded commitments 
we seek to maintain a surplus cash capital position 
our equity capital of  million  mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock of million  mandatorily redeemable preferred interest of consolidated subsidiaries of million  and long term borrowings debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than months of  million comprise our total capital of  million as of december   which exceeded cash capital requirements 
analysis of financial condition and capital resources financial condition as previously discussed  we have historically maintained a highly liquid balance sheet  with a substantial portion of our total assets consisting of cash  highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables  arising principally from traditional securities brokerage activity 
as our government and agencies fixed income business has expanded during  a greater portion of our securities inventory is comprised of us government and agency securities  for which there is a deep and liquid market 
total assets increased to  million at december  or by  from  million at december  primarily due to an increase in the level of our financial instruments owned inventory  a net increase in our collateralized transaction activity and receivables associated with principal and agency transactions consistent with the higher level of financial instruments owned inventory 
the inventory level of our financial instruments owned  including securities pledged to creditors  doubled to  million at december  from  million at december   while our financial instruments sold  not yet purchased also commensurately increased to  million at december  from  million at december  our securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell increased on a net basis to  million at december   or by  while our securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased on a net basis to  million at december   or by 
during  we issued senior unsecured notes  maturing  with an aggregate principal amount of million and received net cash proceeds of million 
on october   we issued convertible senior debentures  maturing in  with an aggregate principal amount of million  each  debenture convertible into shares of our common stock and received net cash proceeds of million 
common stockholders equity increased to  million at december  from  million at december  the increase in our common stockholders equity is principally attributed to net earnings to common shareholders of million in  net currency translation adjustments as the british pound strengthened against the us dollar in the first half of and the equity component of our issuance of convertible senior debentures in october  partially offset by repurchases of approximately million shares of our common stock during  which increased our treasury stock by million  and the impact of a tax deficiency on the deductibility of employee share based awards upon distribution of the awards to employees

tangible common book value per share equals tangible common stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding 
adjusted common tangible book value per share equals tangible common stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding adjusted for outstanding restricted stock units 
outstanding restricted stock units  which give the recipient the right to receive common shares at the end of a specified deferral period  are granted in connection with our share based employee incentive plans and include both awards that contain future service requirements and awards for which the future service requirements have been met 
tangible common stockholders equity  tangible common book value per share  adjusted common book value per share and adjusted tangible common book value per share are non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that includes adjustments to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  or for which there is no specific gaap guidance 
we calculate tangible common stockholders equity as common stockholders equity less intangible assets  specifically goodwill 
goodwill is subtracted from common stockholders equity in determining tangible common stockholders equity as we believe that goodwill does not constitute an operating asset  which can be deployed in a liquid manner 
we calculate tangible common book value per share by dividing tangible common stockholders equity by common stock outstanding 
we calculate adjusted common book value per share as common stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding adjusted for outstanding restricted stock units 
we calculate adjusted tangible common book value per share by dividing tangible common stockholders equity by common shares outstanding adjusted for outstanding restricted stock units 
we believe the adjustment to shares outstanding for outstanding restricted stock units reflects potential economic claims on our net assets enabling shareholders to better assess their standing with respect to our financial condition 
valuations of financial companies are often measured as a multiple of tangible common stockholders equity  inclusive of any dilutive effects  making these ratios  and changes in these ratios  a meaningful measurement for investors

risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
the extent to which we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness and profitability 
we seek to identify  assess  monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities market  credit  operational  legal and compliance  new business  reputational and other 
risk management is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
our risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
market risk 
the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments is referred to as market risk 
our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  commodity prices and foreign exchange rates  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
commodity price risks result from exposure to the changes in prices and volatilities of individual commodities  commodity baskets and commodity indices 
market risk arises from market making  proprietary trading  underwriting  specialist and investing activities 
we seek to manage our exposure to market risk by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes  and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of financial instruments  such as securities and derivatives  held by us fails to perform its contractual obligations 
we follow industry practices to reduce credit risk related to various trading  investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
we adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
liabilities to other brokers and dealers related to unsettled transactions ie  securities failed to receive are recorded at the amount for which the securities were purchased  and are paid upon receipt of the securities from other brokers or dealers 
in the case of aged securities failed to receive  we may purchase the underlying security in the market and seek reimbursement for losses from the counterparty in accordance with standard industry practices 
operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
in addition  the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
if any of our financial  accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications 
table of contents services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
we also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code  and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
legal and compliance risk 
legal and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  anti money laundering and record keeping 
we also maintain an anonymous hotline for employees or others to report suspected inappropriate actions by us or by our employees or agents 
new business risk 
new business risk refers to the risks of entering into a new line of business or offering a new product 
by entering a new line of business or offering a new product  we may face risks that we are unaccustomed to dealing with and may increase the magnitude of the risks we currently face 
we review proposals for new businesses and new products to determine if we are prepared to handle the additional or increased risks associated with entering into such activities 
reputational risk 
we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is an important aspect of minimizing legal and operational risks 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities 
we seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards 
other risk 
other risks encountered by us include political  regulatory and tax risks 
these risks reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions 
in an effort to mitigate these risks  we continuously review new and pending regulations and legislation and participate in various industry interest groups 
accounting and regulatory developments the following is a summary of asc topics that have or will impact our disclosures and or accounting policies for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods earnings per share we adopted accounting changes described in asc  earnings per share topic  on january  which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  are included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class 
table of contents method described in asc unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two class method 
accordingly  all prior period eps data presented has been adjusted to comply with the provisions of asc the adoption of accounting changes described in asc reduced previously reported basic and diluted eps from a loss of to a loss of for the year ended december   and reduced basic eps from earnings of to earnings of and diluted eps from earnings of to earnings of for the year ended december  debt we apply the provisions of accounting updates described in asc  debt topic  effective january   which clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement were not previously addressed by asc and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
this is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  adoption of this accounting update did not affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
business combinations we apply the provisions of accounting described in asc  business combinations topic  to business combinations occurring after january  this requires an entity to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration measured at their fair value at the acquisition date for any business combination consummated after the effective date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
adoption of this accounting change did not affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  but may have an effect on accounting for future business combinations 
consolidation we adopted the provisions of accounting described in asc  consolidation topic  on january   which requires an entity to clearly identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the entity in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the entity s equity 
it also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income  changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly  as equity transactions  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value 
refer to note for further discussion on the adoption of the changes described in asc we have adopted further accounting changes described in asc  consolidation topic  as of january   which require that the party who has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity consolidate the variable interest entity 
the changes to asc  effective as of january   eliminate the quantitative approach previously applied to assessing the consolidation of a variable interest entity and require ongoing reassessments for consolidation 
upon adoption of these accounting changes on january   we consolidated certain managed collateralized loan obligations clos and other investment vehicles 
the consolidation of these entities resulted in an increase in total assets of  million  an increase in total liabilities of  million and an increase to stockholders equity of million on january  in january  we sold and assigned our management agreements for the clos to a third party  thus we no longer have the power to direct the most significant activities of the clos 
upon the assignment of the management agreements in the first quarter of  we deconsolidated the clos and account for our remaining interests in the clos at fair value 

table of contents fair value measurements and disclosures we adopted accounting updates included in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures topic  as of april   which provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
asc also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
the adoption of these updates did not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued accounting updates to asc  fair value measurements and disclosures topic measuring liabilities at fair value  which provides clarifying guidance for determining the fair value of a liability 
we adopted this accounting update on october   which did not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on october   we adopted the accounting updates to asc  fair value measurements and disclosures topic investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent 
accordingly  investments that have the characteristics of an investment company and have no readily determinable fair value are measured based on the net asset value per share of the investment 
the accounting updates also require disclosure by major category of investment about the attributes of the investment  the nature of any redemption restrictions on the investment  any unfunded commitments we have pertaining to the investment and the investment strategies of the underlying investees 
there was no material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as a result of this adoption 
transfers and servicing we adopted accounting updates included in asc  transfers and servicing topic  effective january   which require an initial transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase financing that was entered into contemporaneously or in contemplation of the initial transfer to be evaluated as a linked transaction unless certain criteria are met 
the updates to asc are to be applied prospectively for new transactions entered into after the adoption date 
the adoption did not have a material effect on financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
we adopted further accounting changes described in asc  transfers and servicing topic  as of january   which eliminate the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  require that a transferor consider all arrangements made contemporaneously with  or in contemplation of  a transfer of assets when determining whether derecognition of a financial asset is appropriate  clarify the requirement that a transferred financial asset be legally isolated from the transferor and any of its consolidated affiliates  stipulate that constraints on a transferee s ability to freely pledge or exchange transferred assets causes the transfer to fail sale accounting  and define participating interests and provides guidance on derecognizing participating interests 
the adoption did not have an effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to applying business judgment  we use a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk 
these tools include inventory position and exposure limits  on a gross and net basis  for selected business units  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equities markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and risk limits based on a summary measure of risk exposure referred to as value at risk 
value at risk jefferies estimates value at risk var using a model that simulates revenue and loss distributions on all financial instruments by applying historical market changes to the current portfolio 
using the results of this simulation  var measures potential loss of trading revenues at a given confidence level over a specified time horizon 
we calculate var over a one day holding period measured at a confidence level which implies that  on 
table of contents average  we expect to realize a loss of daily trading revenue at least as large as the var amount on one out of every twenty trading days 
var is one measurement of potential loss in trading revenues that may result from adverse market movements over a specified period of time with a selected likelihood of occurrence 
as with all measures of var  our estimate has substantial limitations due to our reliance on historical performance  which is not necessarily a predictor of the future 
consequently  this var estimate is only one of a number of tools we use in our daily risk management activities 
var is a model that predicts the future risk based on historical data 
we could incur losses greater than the reported var because the historical market prices and rates changes may not be an accurate measure of future market events and conditions 
in addition  the var model measures the risk of a current static position over a one day horizon and might not predict the future position 
when comparing our var numbers to those of other firms  it is important to remember that different methodologies could produce significantly different results 
the var numbers below are shown separately for interest rate  equity  currency and commodity products  as well as for our overall trading positions  excluding corporate investments in asset management positions  using a historical simulation approach 
the aggregated var presented here is less than the sum of the individual components ie  interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk  equity risk and commodity price risk due to the benefit of diversification among the risk categories 
diversification benefit equals the difference between aggregated var and the sum of vars for the four risk categories 
the following table illustrates the var for each component of market risk 
daily var value at risk in trading portfolios at year ending year ending risk categories average high low average high low in millions interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect firmwide var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specific confidence level 
for the var numbers reported above  a one day time horizon and confidence level were used 
average var of million during decreased from the million average during due mainly to a decrease in exposure to equity prices  partially offset by an increase in exposure to interest rates 
the decrease in our exposure to equity prices in comparing average var for to average var for is attributed primarily to elevated var levels for a period of time in after we acquired million common shares of leucadia national corporation in april the increase in our exposure to interest rates for is due to the growth of our fixed income business throughout and the related inventory levels of that business 

table of contents the following table presents our daily var over the last four quarters var trended higher during the third quarter of as we continued to expand fixed income trading activity 
this was offset during the fourth quarter of as our inventory mix created a greater diversification effect on overall var 
var back testing the comparison of daily actual revenue fluctuations with the daily var estimate is the primary method used to test the efficacy of the var model 
back testing is performed at various levels of the trading portfolio  from the holding company level down to specific business lines 
a back testing exception occurs when the daily loss exceeds the daily var estimate 
results of the process at the aggregate level demonstrated no outliers when comparing the one day var with the back testing profit and loss in a confidence one day var model usually should not have more than twelve out of days back testing exceptions on an annual basis 
back testing profit and loss is a subset of actual trading revenue  excluding fees  commissions  and certain provisions 
we compare the trading revenue with var for back testing purposes because var assesses only the potential change in position value due to overnight movements in financial market variables such as prices  interest rates and volatilities under 
table of contents normal market conditions 
the graph below illustrates the relationship between daily back testing trading profit and loss and daily var for us in during the third quarter of  we benefited from certain exceptional fixed income and high yield trading opportunities  which is reflected in the relationship between our back testing revenues and var estimates for 
table of contents daily trading net revenue in millions trading revenue used in the histogram below entitled vs 
distribution of daily trading revenue is the actual daily trading revenue which is excluding fees  commissions and certain provisions 
the histogram below shows the distribution of daily trading revenue for substantially all of our trading activities 
line graph during the quarter ended september   we changed the groupings of the daily trading revenue histogram 
previously  daily trading revenue was grouped in million increments ranging from million to million 
as of september   the grouping is presented in million increments ranging from million to million 
this presentation provides more information across the distribution by reducing the maximum number of days in any single grouping
