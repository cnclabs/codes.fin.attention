item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the world s leading vertically integrated producers  marketers and distributors of high quality fresh and fresh cut fruit and vegetables  as well as a leading producer and marketer of prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages and snacks in europe  africa and the middle east 
we market our products worldwide under the del monte brand  a symbol of product innovation  quality  freshness and reliability since our global sourcing and logistics system allows us to provide regular delivery of consistently high quality produce and value added services to our customers 
our major producing operations are located in north  central and south america  asia and africa 
production operations are aggregated on the basis of our products bananas  other fresh produce  prepared foods and other products and services 
other fresh produce includes pineapples  melons  tomatoes  non tropical fruit including grapes  apples  pears  peaches  plums  nectarines  apricots  avocados  citrus and kiwis  fresh cut produce and other fruit and vegetables 
prepared foods include prepared fruit and vegetables  juices  beverages  snacks  poultry and meat products 
other products and services includes a plastic product and box manufacturing business  a grain business and third party ocean freight services 
strategy our strategy is focused on a combination of maximizing revenues from our existing infrastructure  entering new markets and strict cost control initiatives 
we plan to continue to capitalize on the growing global demand for fresh produce and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
we expect sales growth of fresh produce in key markets by increasing sales volume and per unit sales prices as permitted by market conditions 
our recent acquisitions have substantially increased our production capability of bananas  pineapples and melon and provide the potential over time for significant operating efficiencies and synergies 
in addition  our number one position in the gold pineapple market has been further strengthened 
our strategy includes increasing volumes from existing production and distribution facilities in order to improve operating efficiencies and reduce per unit costs 
we plan additional investments in growth markets by adding distribution facilities and expanding our value added services 
net sales our net sales are affected by numerous factors  including mainly the balance between the supply of and demand for our produce and competition from other fresh produce companies 
our net sales are also dependent on our ability to supply a consistent volume and quality of fresh produce to the markets we serve 
for example  seasonal variations in demand for bananas as a result of increased supply and competition from other fruit are reflected in the seasonal fluctuations in banana prices  with the first six months of each year generally exhibiting stronger demand and higher prices  except in those years where an excess supply exists 
during  generally  bananas were in short supply at certain times of the year  which contributed to a improvement in our worldwide per unit sales prices 
in the processed foods business  we generally realize the largest portion of our net sales and gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
during  our prepared food net sales were negatively affected by the current challenging economic conditions  principally in the uk market  which resulted in lower sales volume 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our net sales are significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we conduct our sales versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus such currencies resulting in increased net sales in dollar terms 
including the effect of our foreign currency hedges  net sales for were negatively impacted by approximately million  as compared to  principally as a result of a weaker british pound  south korean won  euro and polish zloty  partially offset by a stronger japanese yen  versus the us dollar 
our net sales growth in recent years has been achieved primarily through increased sales volume in existing markets of other fresh produce  primarily pineapples  melons and non tropical fruit  and favorable pricing on our del monte gold extra sweet pineapple combined with increased sales volume and per unit sales prices of bananas in existing and new markets 
during  our net sales were positively affected by higher sales volume of bananas  gold pineapples and melons that resulted from our recent acquisitions and production expansion  which were offset principally by lower net sales of prepared food and other products and services 
also positively impacting our sales in were higher sales volumes of avocados in north america 
our net sales growth in recent years is also attributable to a broadening of our product line with the expansion of our fresh cut produce business and our expansion into new markets 
we expect our net sales growth to continue to be driven by increased sales volumes in our banana  other fresh produce and the prepared food segments 
as a result of our acquisitions and expansion of our production of banana  gold pineapple and melon operations  we expect a further increase in net sales of these products in north america  europe and the middle east 
in the middle east  we expect to increase our net sales of our fresh produce and prepared food product offerings as a result of our expansion in the saudi arabian market 
we also expect to increase our sales by developing new products in the prepared food segment  targeting the convenience store and foodservice trade in selected european and middle east markets 
cost of products sold cost of products sold is principally composed of two elements  product and logistics costs 
product cost for our produce is primarily composed of cultivation the cost of growing crops  harvesting  packaging  labor  depreciation and farm administration 
product cost for produce obtained from independent growers is composed of produce and packaging costs 
logistics costs include land and sea transportation and expenses related to port facilities and distribution centers 
sea transportation cost is the most significant component of logistics costs and is comprised of the cost of vessel operating expenses and chartering refrigerated vessels 
vessel operating expenses for our owned vessels include operations  maintenance  depreciation  insurance  fuel the cost of which is subject to commodity price fluctuations  and port charges 
for chartered vessels  operating expenses include the cost of chartering the vessels  fuel and port charges 
variations in containerboard prices  which affect the cost of boxes and other packaging materials  and fuel prices can have a significant impact on our product cost and our profit margins 
also  variations in the production yields  fertilizers and other input costs and the cost to procure products from independent growers can have a significant impact on our costs 
containerboard  plastic  resin and fuel prices have historically been volatile 
during  the cost of fuel increased by and containerboard increased by 
this increase in containerboard and fuel prices added approximately million to cost of products sold in as compared to during  fuel prices decreased by and containerboard decreased as compared with  reducing cost of products sold by million 
this decrease in cost of products sold that resulted from lower fuel and containerboard prices was partially offset by an increase in production costs due to lower yields and higher input costs and increased cost of produce from independent growers of approximately million and a charge of million related to growing crop inventory as a result of our decision to discontinue pineapple operations in brazil 
in general  changes in our volume of products sold can have a disproportionate effect on our gross profit 
within any particular year  a significant portion of our cost of products sold is fixed  both with respect to our operations and with respect to the cost of produce purchased from independent growers from whom we have agreed to purchase all the products they produce 
accordingly  higher volumes produced on company owned farms directly reduce the average per box cost  while lower volumes directly increase the average per box cost 
in addition  because the volume that will actually be produced on our farms and by independent growers in any given year depends on a variety of factors  including weather  that are beyond our control or the control of our independent growers  it is difficult to predict volumes and per box costs 
since our financial reporting currency is the us dollar  our costs are affected by fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we have significant operations versus the dollar  with a weak dollar versus those currencies resulting in increased costs 
during  cost of products sold was favorably impacted by approximately million as a result of a stronger us dollar versus the various currencies in which we have significant operations

during  we recorded currency exchange losses that resulted primarily from unfavorable exchange rate movements in the euro  british pound and other currencies versus the us dollar 
provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes was a benefit of million in related principally to million of net changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance due to expected utilization of deferred tax assets as a result of increased profitability of our north america operations combined with the settlement of certain tax positions in connection with an audit 
income taxes consist of the consolidation of the tax provisions  computed on a separate entity basis  in each country in which we have operations 
since we are a non us company with substantial operations outside the united states  a substantial portion of our results of operations is not subject to us taxation 
many of the countries in which we operate have favorable tax rates 
we are subject to us taxation on our operations in the united states 
from time to time  tax authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate audit our tax returns and review our business structures and positions and there are audits presently pending in various countries 
there can be no assurance that any tax audits  or changes in existing tax laws or interpretations in countries in which we operate  will not result in an increased effective tax rate for us 
we have established tax accruals for uncertain tax positions  including those relating to various tax audits currently in process 
the amount of income taxes due as a result of the eventual outcome of these audits may differ from the amount of estimated tax accruals
