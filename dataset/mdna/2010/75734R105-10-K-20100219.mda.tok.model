item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the item selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto beginning on page f  and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the largest manufacturer and distributor of packaged ice in the united states and serve a variety of customers in states and the district of columbia 
our business consists of the traditional manufacture and delivery of ice from a central point of production to the point of sale  and the installation and operation of the ice factory  our proprietary in store bagging isb equipment located in high volume locations that produces  packages and stores ice through an automated  self contained system 
seasonality 
our results of operations are highly seasonal  characterized by peak demand during the warmer months of may through september  with an extended peak selling season in the southern united states 
as a result of this seasonality and the fixed costs in our business  the proportion of revenues earned and the ratio of costs to revenues in any given quarter are not necessarily indicative of the ratios for a full year 
revenues within specific markets can also be affected by weather conditions  with cool or rainy weather negatively impacting demand and extremely hot weather increasing our costs as we respond to excess customer demand for our products 
approximately   and of our revenues occurred during the second and third calendar quarters in  and  respectively 
as a result of seasonal revenue declines and a less than proportional decline in certain expenses during the first and fourth calendar quarters  we typically experience lower profit margins resulting in losses during these periods 
in addition  because a significant portion of our annual sales are generated during the second and third calendar quarters  our annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly if the weather during these periods is unusually cool or rainy on a national or regional basis 
cool and rainy weather has a negative impact on operations  while warm and dry weather generally has a positive impact 
for additional information concerning the impact of seasonality on our results of operations  see general economic trends and seasonality 
revenues 
our revenues primarily represent sales of packaged ice and packaged ice bags for use in our isb equipment 
there is no right of return with respect to these products

based on the evaluation of our enterprise value and the estimated amount by which the current fair value of our fixed assets and intangible assets exceeded their book value  we concluded that our goodwill was impaired 
as a result  a non cash charge of million pretax was recorded during the three months ended september  to reduce goodwill to its estimated fair value as of september  key assumptions for the impairment evaluation included the market price of company s stock and control premium 
based on the evaluation of the company s stock price and trading activity in september and october  a price of per share was used for the analysis as that amount

during  capital expenditures totaled million  excluding million related to the reimbursement of the cost of equipment deployed and subsequently placed under operating leases 
approximately million of the total reimbursements were received in  with the remainder being received in january capital expenditures were higher than anticipated during due to changes in the availability and the timing of planned entry into equipment operating leases and the purchases of certain assets 
as we have consolidated acquisitions into the existing company infrastructure  we have identified non core and excess assets which can be disposed of  such as real estate and machinery and equipment 
from time to time  we also dispose of other assets which are no longer useful in our operations 
as a result of dispositions of these non core and excess assets  we realized proceeds of approximately million in our net capital expenditures in were million

we may also be required to make an offer to purchase the senior discount notes with proceeds of asset sales that are not reinvested in our 
table of contents business or used to repay other indebtedness 
we registered the senior discount notes with the sec pursuant to a registration statement that was declared effective on august  the indenture governing our senior discount notes restricts the amount of dividends  distributions and other restricted payments we may pay 
under the indenture  we are restricted from paying dividends on our common stock unless  at the time of such payment no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof  the consolidated coverage ratio set forth in the indenture governing our senior discount notes exceeds to  and there is sufficient capacity under the buildup amount under the indenture governing our senior discount notes 
the consolidated coverage ratio under the indenture governing our senior discount notes is defined as the ratio of our adjusted ebitda for the most recent four fiscal quarters to our consolidated interest expense for such four quarter period 
adjusted ebitda under the indenture governing our senior discount notes is defined as the sum of our consolidated net income plus our income tax expense  our interest expense  our depreciation and amortization expense  unrealized non cash gains or losses or non cash charges in respect of hedging obligations required to be taken under generally accepted accounting principles  unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses and all other non cash charges  except to the extent representing an accrual or reserve for a future cash expenditure

we are generally required to calculate our consolidated coverage ratio on a pro forma basis to give effect to incurrences and repayments of indebtedness as well as acquisitions and dispositions 
the buildup amount equals of our consolidated net income accrued during the period treated as one accounting period from july  to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available or  if such consolidated net income is a deficit  minus of such deficit  plus  the net cash proceeds of the issuance of capital stock  subject to certain exceptions  and any cash capital contribution received by us from our stockholders in each case after august  plus the amount by which our indebtedness is reduced on our balance sheet as a result of the conversion or exchange of such indebtedness for our capital stock  plus the net reduction in 
table of contents certain restricted investments made by us  less the amount of certain restricted payments we make from time to time  including  among other things  the payment of cash dividends 
as of december   the buildup amount was negative  primarily as a result of the million non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in we are not currently permitted to pay dividends under this provision 
in addition  regardless of whether we could make any restricted payments under the buildup amount provision referred to above  we may make dividend payments at any time in an aggregate amount of up to million if no default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture and following our initial public offering  pay dividends on our capital stock of up to per year of the cash proceeds net of underwriters fees  discounts  commissions or other expenses paid by us received by us from all such public equity offerings subject to specified conditions 
accordingly  we are able to pay approximately million annually in dividends under this provision

lcp filed for bankruptcy in october during the year ended december   we made borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
lcp failed to fund its commitments related to such borrowings and we do not believe lcp will fund borrowing requests made in the future 
as a result  the amount available to us under the revolving credit facility has been effectively reduced by million 
principal balances outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest per annum  at our option  at the sum of the base rate plus or libor plus

our credit facilities contain financial covenants  which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios  as defined in the credit facilities  and are collateralized by substantially all of reddy corp 
s assets 
at december   reddy corp 
was in compliance with these covenants 
reddy holdings guarantees reddy corp 
s credit facilities and such guarantee is collateralized by a pledge of the capital stock of reddy corp

as of december   the amount of cumulative distributable cash was million 
such dividends may only be paid if reddy corp 
s leverage ratio for the most recently ended fiscal quarter is less than or equal to to in addition  the credit facilities preclude reddy corp 
from declaring or paying such dividends if a default or event of default under the credit facilities has occurred and is continuing 
in particular  it will be an event of default if reddy corp 
s leverage ratio exceeds to or reddy corp 
s interest coverage ratio is less than to if at the end of any fiscal quarter  reddy corp 
s leverage ratio is greater than to  and therefore reddy corp 
is not permitted to pay dividends  reddy corp 
will be required by our credit facilities to apply of reddy corp 
s available cash generated during each such quarter  if positive  to make a mandatory prepayment of the loans under our credit facilities 
if reddy corp 
is not able to pay dividends to reddy holdings  reddy holdings may not be able to pay the interest due under our senior discount notes  which would cause a default under the indenture governing our senior discount notes

adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income loss  cash flows from operations or net cash from operating or investing activities as defined by gaap  and it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs as determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  not all companies use identical calculations  and this presentation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

reddy holdings is currently paying these costs from the excess cash remaining from the initial public offering of its common stock in august  the funds paid to reddy holdings by affiliates of gso capital partners lp in february in connection with the termination of a merger agreement and insurance proceeds from one of our insurance carriers 
c represents the incremental adjusted ebitda of acquired businesses as if each acquisition had been consummated on the first day of the period presented 
all acquisitions included herein were consummated on or before december  interest rate hedging agreements 
effective september   we entered into an interest rate hedging agreement the hedge to lock the interest rate on a portion of our term loan 
the hedge had a term of three years and ten months and expired on july  the hedge had an initial notional balance of million 
we paid a fixed rate of on the notional balance outstanding and received an amount equal to month libor 
effective february   we entered into a second interest rate hedging agreement the hedge to lock the interest rate on a portion of our term loan 
the hedge had a term of months and expired on december  the hedge had a notional balance of million from the inception date to july   at which time the notional balance increased to million for the remaining term 
we paid a fixed rate of on the notional balance outstanding and received an amount equal to month libor 
any net payable or receivable amount was settled monthly 
we used interest rate hedges to minimize the risk of increases in floating interest rates 
the interest rate hedges were not for trading purposes and were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
diesel hedging agreement 
on february   we entered into a hedge to fix the price per gallon of a portion of our diesel fuel requirements the diesel hedge 
the diesel hedge began february  and expired on december  the notional amount of gallons hedged changed on a monthly basis to match our anticipated utilization 
we paid a fixed rate of per gallon wholesale basis and received an amount equal to a wholesale index rate 
any net payable or receivable amount was settled monthly 
we used the diesel hedge to minimize the risk of rising fuel prices 
the hedge was not for trading purposes and was accounted for as an economic hedge and was not designated as a hedging instrument 
liquidity outlook 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  we record the majority of our revenues and profits during the months of may through september 
the majority of the cash generated from those operations is received between july and november 
we expect to fully utilize the excess cash generated from our selling season during the winter and spring of to fund our operations  debt service  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our capital expenditures are used to maintain and expand our traditional ice and isb operations 
in the normal course of our business  we dispose of obsolete  worn out and unneeded assets and have historically applied those funds against capital expenditures 
we currently estimate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million to million net of dispositions and operating leases  however  if additional liquidity becomes available  we expect capital expenditures to increase in order to accelerate our strategic growth 
based on our expected level of operations  we believe that cash flows from operations  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
as of february   we had approximately million of cash on hand at reddy holdings  approximately million of cash at reddy corp 
and approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility  which reflected outstanding standby letters of credit of million and a million reduction based on the expected 
table of contents non performance by lcp of its commitment under our revolving credit facility 
a limited amount of borrowings under our revolving credit facility are expected to occur in the spring as our cash flows from operations decline to their lowest point during march and april due to reduced sales in january and february 
we incur a substantial portion of our annual capital expenditures prior to the summer selling season and we need to finance seasonal increases in accounts receivable and inventories as temperatures and sales volumes begin to increase in april and may 
we expect availability under our revolving credit facility to be no less than million though the expiration of the facility on august  we are managing our cash position and capital requirements over the next months to allow us to operate without the revolving credit facility after the expiration date 
we currently project having sufficient cash on hand at the end of to allow us to safely operate throughout on february   we announced that reddy corp 
intends to offer to exchange in a private placement new senior secured notes for our outstanding discount notes due in and that reddy corp 
intends to commence an offering  subject to market and other conditions  of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in a private offering 
we intend to use the proceeds of the offering to refinance our existing term loan and to pay estimated transaction fees and expenses  with the balance retained for general corporate purposes  including funding future growth initiatives identified in our strategic planning process and acquisitions 
the exchange offer will be subject to certain conditions and we have the right to waive these conditions or to terminate or withdraw the exchange offer at any time and for any reason prior to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to the offer 
as noted previously  we record the majority of our sales and any profits during the months of may through september and the majority of the cash generated from those operations is received in july through november  by which time  we expect to have repaid all amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility in the spring  fund current capital expenditures and debt service and build up cash balances 
we expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants over the next twelve months  however  in the event that we are in jeopardy of a dividend suspension period under reddy corp 
s credit facilities  or the margin of compliance with the leverage ratio financial covenant in reddy corp 
s credit facilities narrows  we could use a portion of our excess cash or revolving credit facility availability to pay down principal on the term loan  contribute reddy ice holdings cash to reddy corp  take operational action or defer capital expenditures and controllable expenses to maintain compliance 
interest expense on our senior discount notes see senior discount notes became payable in cash on a semi annual basis beginning may  the annual cash obligation for this interest is million 
expenses in connection with the antitrust investigations and related civil litigation may require the use of cash on hand at reddy holdings or reddy corp 
or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of february   our cash on hand at reddy holdings  net of accrued expenses related the antitrust investigations and related civil litigation  was approximately million 
based on the current status of the investigation and related civil litigation and projected expenses  we believe reddy holdings cash balance will be sufficient to fund these expenses for the next twelve months  however this expectation includes assumptions regarding matters beyond our control or knowledge 
if reddy holdings were to require additional cash to fund its expenses related to the antitrust investigations  reddy corp 
has the ability under the credit facility to transfer million to reddy holdings in each of and and reddy holdings is permitted to raise at least million in additional debt 
we have received reimbursements of million to date from one of our insurance carriers as reimbursements of certain legal expenses and are working to maximize any additional potential reimbursements 
the amount of any future reimbursements cannot be estimated at this time 

table of contents contractual obligations 
the table below summarizes the future payments due under our significant contractual obligations as of december  total and thereafter in millions long term debt operating leases purchase obligations uncertain tax positions total contractual obligations includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the debt 
consists of our obligation to purchase i  merchandisers during the period from september  to december  under a supply agreement that expires december   ii million bags per year under a supply agreement that expires on december  and iii preferred units of an ice machine leasing and service company  which can be canceled at any time 
due to the uncertainty related to the timing and reversal of uncertain tax positions  only the short term uncertain tax benefits have been provided in the table above 
the long term amounts excluded from the table above were approximately million 
general economic trends and seasonality our results of operations are generally affected by the economic trends in our market area 
we believe end users of our products use packaged ice in many applications  including recreational activities  the construction industry  agriculture and special events 
weakness in the national economy combined with other factors including inflation  interest rate fluctuations  increases in fuel and other energy costs  labor and healthcare costs and the availability of financing  may negatively impact consumer confidence and the business prospects of our commercial customers 
if consumer activities associated with the use of our products decline or the business activities of our commercial customers decrease  our revenues and sales volumes may decline 
our results to date have not been significantly impacted by inflation  other than costs directly related to energy prices  such as fuel  plastic bags and electricity 
if we experience high inflation in these costs in the future  or inflationary pressures have significant effects on other cost categories  we may not be able to pass on all of these higher costs to our customers in the short term 
we do believe that we will be able to pass on higher costs to our customers over longer periods of time  however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts 
the ice business is highly seasonal  with the bulk of demand coming in the warmer spring and summer months 
accordingly  we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and profitability 
we make a disproportionate amount of our sales in the second and third calendar quarters 
we also typically earn any net income in these same periods  whereas we typically experience net losses in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
we believe that approximately two thirds of our revenues will occur during the second and third calendar quarters when the weather conditions are generally warmer and demand is greater  while approximately one third of our revenues will occur during the first and fourth calendar quarters when the weather is generally cooler 
this belief is consistent with historical trends 
as a result of seasonal revenue declines and the lack of proportional corresponding expense decreases  we will most likely experience lower profit margins and losses during the first and fourth calendar quarters 
in addition  because our operating results depend significantly on sales during our peak season  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of adverse weather 
table of contents during this peak selling period if the weather is unusually cool or rainy on a more national or regional basis 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make the required payments on their accounts 
we have attempted to reserve for these estimated losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments on their accounts  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets 
property and equipment is carried at cost and is being depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated lives of to years for buildings and site improvements and to years for plant  equipment and machinery 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the assets useful life 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred  while capital improvements that extend the useful lives of the underlying assets are capitalized 
we accounted for all of our historical acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and as a result recorded significant amounts of goodwill 
other intangible assets include the following that are amortized over their useful lives intangible assets useful life goodwill indefinite life trade name indefinite life patent remaining legal life as of acquisition date customer relationships straight line method over economic lives of eight to years debt issue costs effective interest method over the term of the debt reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self insured retentions 
these claims include workers compensation claims  automobile claims for injury or property damage involving our fleet and general liability claims typically involving certain slip and fall injuries at customer locations 
these types of claims may take time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for a period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates  which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
in accordance with authoritative guidance on impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability of long lived assets and certain other identifiable intangible assets is 
table of contents based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or its disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and other intangible assets that management expects to hold and use are based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value 
in accordance with authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is evaluated using a market valuation approach  based on valuations of comparable businesses  multiples of earnings of comparable businesses and discounted cash flows 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets are evaluated at each fiscal year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
at december   we considered the market value of our stock and a reasonable control premium to evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill 
inherent in the determination of such future cash flows and valuations are certain estimates and judgments  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market values and assumptions about our strategic plans with regards to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusions regarding the impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method  which requires  among other things  recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and the recognition of available tax carryforwards 
we account for the benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities having full knowledge of all relevant information 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax liabilities are included in tax expense 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of packaged ice products has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
there is no right of return with respect to the delivered packaged ice products 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair values of the awards and is recognized as expense over the period in which the stock based compensation vests 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb delayed the effective date of the authoritative guidance on nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november  we elected to defer the adoption of the guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until january  the adoption of this guidance on january  had no impact on our results of operations and financial position 
no assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations 
this guidance establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
this guidance significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas  including the treatment of contingent consideration  preacquisition contingencies  transaction costs and restructuring costs 
in addition  changes in an acquired entity s deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement 
table of contents period will impact income tax expense 
the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the adoption of this standard on january  had no impact on our results of operations and financial position  however  in accordance with the new standard  million of acquisition related costs were expensed and a million gain on bargain purchase was recognized related to an acquisition completed in in march  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the guidance will require enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and its related interpretations and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows

this guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applied only to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
the adoption of this standard on january  had no impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
according to this guidance  unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities 
as such  they have been included in the computation of basic earnings per share under the two class method 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on disclosure requirements for financial instruments 
this guidance requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual financial statements 
this guidance was effective for interim periods ending after june   but early adoption was permitted for interim periods ending after march  we adopted this guidance in the three months ended june  and have included the required disclosures see note to the consolidated financial statements included eleswhere in this annual report on form k 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on subsequent events 
this guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june   and we adopted this guidance during the three months ended june  the adoption of the guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have performed an evaluation of subsequent events through february   which is the date these financial statements were issued 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles the codification 
the codification became the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the codification did not change gaap but reorganizes the literature 
the codification was effective for interim and annual periods ending after september   and we adopted the codification during the three months ended september  new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
asu changes how 
table of contents a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
asu also requires a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within the first annual reporting period 
the adoption of asu on january  did not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our main market risk category is interest rate risk 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating interest rates under our senior credit facilities 
principal balances outstanding under the term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at the london inter bank offered rate libor plus or the prime rate as announced from time to time by the administrative agent plus 
as of december   our credit facilities had an outstanding principal balance of million at a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
at december   the month libor rate was 
if libor were to increase by from that level  the annual increase in interest expense  given our principal balances at december   would be approximately million
