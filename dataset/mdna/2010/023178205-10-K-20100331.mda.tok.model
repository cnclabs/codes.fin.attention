overview the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  among others  those identified under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report 
during  the company operated in the following business segments cruise  which includes the operations of windstar cruises and majestic american line  and corporate and other  which consists of general corporate assets and liabilities 
cruise operations our current cruise operations include the windstar cruise vessels which are international flagged ships that sail to destinations in the caribbean  europe  the americas and the greek isles 
windstar cruises operates three sailing yachts including wind surf  wind spirit and wind star known for their ability to visit the hidden harbors and secluded coves of the world s most treasured destinations 
the luxurious ships of windstar sail to nearly nations  calling at approximately ports throughout europe  the caribbean and the americas 
during and continuing in  we are focused on improving our windstar cruises business performance and have identified several major areas for improvement as follows increase our sales and marketing efficiencies to drive more sales  which will enable us to scale our campaigns to a level appropriate for a company of our size  and reduce operational costs by continuing to renegotiate key vendor contracts that will allow for significant direct cost savings  efficiency gain and product improvements 
in september we completed the transition of our vessel management from a third party vendor to in house management 
this transition is expected to result in efficiency gains and lower operating costs 
majestic america line in april  we announced plans to sell and cease operating the majestic america line  our us flagged cruise ships that sailed along the inland rivers and coastal waterways of north america at the conclusion of the sailing season 
the vessels are currently in lay up status and did not operate in as we plan to exit the business in an orderly fashion 
we sold one of the vessels  queen of the west  in november as of december  we have four remaining vessels of majestic american line that we will continue marketing and disposition activities in  although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in the disposition of the vessels or in locating qualified buyers in a timely fashion 
travel events in april we sold a significant portion of the travel and events business whereby we completed an asset sale of certain assets related to the housing portion of the business 
the buyer also assumed certain liabilities related to housing 
we retained the events component of the business and completed all programs as scheduled 
as of december   we have completed all programs and exited the events business in an efficient and orderly fashion 
marine in may we sold marine group to a company formed by our former chief executive officer through a stock sale for million in cash proceeds 
these proceeds were used to fund current operations 
re insurance in september we executed an assignment agreement with a third party whereby all re insurance assets were assigned and the related liabilities were assumed by the third party 
the company recorded a million loss on the disposition of the re insurance business 
because the company no longer had an obligation for potential claims under the re insurance programs and certain programs were concluded during  letters of credit used to collateralize former re insurance obligations were cancelled  releasing cash of million 
the company used the cash to fund current operations 
in addition to the assignment agreement  the company also entered into a profit sharing agreement with the third party that allows the company to participate in up to of net profit distributions minus losses and expenses as the remaining programs wind down 
although there is a potential for additional cash distributions over the next several years  the profit distributions are contingent on the underlying insurance program performance and release of the profits are subject to regulatory approval 
the operations of the marine group  cypress re  and travel and events are shown as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the assets and liabilities of cypress re  travel and events and the marine group at december  were classified as held for sale 
exchange offer and credit facility in september  we launched an exchange offer the exchange offer to exchange each  principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes due the convertible notes for i shares of the company s common stock  par value per share  and ii principal amount of senior secured notes  due  including guarantees from the company s subsidiaries  the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes can be payable in kind or in cash  at the company s option 
on november   we consummated the exchange offer 
approximately million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes were validly tendered and accepted 
in exchange for the tendered convertible notes  we issued approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and approximately million shares of our common stock 
approximately million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes remain outstanding 
our stockholders approved the issuance of the shares of common stock in the exchange offer at a special stockholder meeting held on november  in march  we entered into a million credit facility which is composed of a million term loan facility and a million revolving line of credit 
in connection with the establishment of the new credit facility  we paid fees of million 
borrowings under the facility bears interest at  are secured on a first priority basis by substantially all of our assets and mature on january  the credit facility requires an annual commitment fee equal to of each of the term loan and the outstanding revolving credit commitment 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those which impact our most critical accounting policies  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  within the framework of current accounting literature 
our businesses are seasonal 
historically  we have recognized the majority of our operating results in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year 
as a result of our business strategy to focus only on the international cruise operations  the majority of our operating results are recognized in the third quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with our cruising season 
our annual results would be adversely affected if our revenue were to be substantially below seasonal norms during any quarter  particularly the third quarter of any year 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe require the most significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions or conditions 
property  vessels and equipment property  vessels and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
we expense the cost of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets when incurred 
major additions and betterments are capitalized 
our ships are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method over the expected useful life ranging up to years  net of a residual value that generally is approximately 
ship replacement parts are capitalized and depreciated upon being placed in service 
office equipment is capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method over the expected useful life of the equipment  ranging up to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the expected useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease 
we perform reviews for the impairment of property  vessels and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment reviews of our vessels require us to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of these assets 
one input in our fair value review is comparable ship sale prices and other comparable ship values in inactive markets 
we also use discounted future cash flow analysis to estimate fair value 
discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgments related to forecasting future operating results  including net revenue yields  net cruise costs including fuel prices  capacity increases  terminal values  cruise itineraries  consumer demand  and competition  among others 
in addition  third party appraisers are sometimes used to assist in the determination of fair values of vessels 
third party appraisers and their valuation methodologies are also subject to uncertainties similar to those discussed above 
we performed a review of our property  vessels and equipment during and recorded impairments to the carrying values of these assets 
drydocking we capitalize drydocking costs as incurred and amortize such costs over the period to the next scheduled drydock 
we believe that the deferral method provides a better matching of revenues and expenses 
drydocking costs are included in prepaid and other current assets and in long term assets in the accompanying balance sheet and are amortized over the cruising season between scheduled dry dockings 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we evaluate recoverability using both subjective and objective factors 
subjective factors include the evaluation of industry and product trends and our strategic focus 
objective factors include observable inputs such as third party appraisals and our estimates of projected future earnings and cash flows 
we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units and other observable inputs when we test goodwill for impairment 
assumptions used include growth rates for revenues and expenses  investment yields on deposits  any future capital expenditure requirements and appropriate discount rates 
we established reporting units based on our current reporting structure 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  goodwill has been allocated to reporting units to the extent it related to each reporting unit 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment using an undiscounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques such as the income approach 
in addition  in determining our trade name fair value we also use discounted future cash flow analysis  which requires significant judgments and estimates 
specifically  determining the estimated amount of royalties avoided by our ownership of the trademark is based on forecasted cruise revenues and estimated royalty rates based on comparable royalty agreements used in similar industries 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service fee is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other cruise revenues we record passenger ticket revenue net of applicable discounts and recognize passenger ticket revenue and related costs of revenue when the cruise is completed 
we generally receive from our customers a partially refundable deposit within one week of booking a tour  with the balance typically remitted days prior to the departure date 
if customers cancel their trip  the nonrefundable portion of their deposit is recognized as revenue on the date of cancellation 
passenger revenue representing travel insurance purchased at the time of reservation is recognized upon the completion of the cruise or passenger cancellation  whichever is earlier and our obligation has been met 
onboard and other cruise revenue consisting of beverage and souvenir sales and optional shore excursions are deferred and recognized as revenue when the cruise is completed 
we recognize revenue from hotel reservation  registration and related travel services when the convention operates 
revenue from the sale of merchandise is recognized when the merchandise is shipped  the service has been provided or when the redemption periods have expired 
we defer revenue from prepaid  certificate based merchandise incentive programs until our obligations are fulfilled 
these revenues have been reported on a net basis  reflecting the net effect of gross billings to the client less any direct program or merchandise costs 
as of december   we have completed all obligations related to the travel and events programs and have recognized all revenues 
we will not engage in this business in periods subsequent to income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  or increase this allowance in a period  it may result in an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
conversely  to the extent we determine that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary  it may result in a benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets because of our uncertainty regarding their realizability 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  or a portion thereof  would be realized  the valuation allowance would be reversed 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income 
at december  and december   the net deferred domestic tax asset is subject to a valuation allowance 
share based compensation we have certain share based employee compensation plans  which are more fully described in note  stock plans 
the company uses the black scholes merton formula to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
expected volatility is based on historical volatilities 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected option life assumed at the date of grant 
the expected term is calculated based on historical experience and represents the time period options actually remain outstanding 
the company estimated forfeitures based on historical pre vesting forfeitures and will revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair values of the financial instruments as of december  and are as follows in thousands carrying fair carrying fair amount value amount value financial assets cash and cash equivalents restricted cash debt results of operations the following table reflects certain income and expense items as a percentage of revenue revenues costs and operating expenses cruise operating expenses selling and tour promotion general and administrative depreciation and amortization impairment charge business interruption insurance claim loss on disposal impairment of vessels operating loss from continuing operations other income expense  net  including gain on debt restructure loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss business segment information we report the following business segments i cruise and ii corporate and other  which consists of general corporate assets and liabilities primarily cash  cash equivalents and long term debt  and other activities which are not directly related to our cruise operating segment 
we reported our marine group and our travel and events as business segments in and included our reinsurance business cypress re  within the corporate segment 
the operations of the marine group  travel and events and cypress re are shown as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
asc  presentation of financial statements discontinued operations  provides that if a discontinued operation had been a reportable segment  we are not required to disclose information about the discontinued segment as required by fasb asc  segment reporting 
accordingly  our segment reporting has been updated to exclude the marine group  travel and events and cypress re 
selected financial information related to these segments is as follows in thousands corporate cruise and other total revenues operating income loss from continuing operations depreciation and amortization expense impairment charge interest and dividend income interest expense gain on debt restructure provision for income taxes capital expenditures for property  vessels  equipment intangible asset total assets excluding assets of discontinued segments revenues operating income loss from continuing operations as restated depreciation and amortization expense interest and dividend income interest expense provision for income taxes capital expenditures for property  vessels  equipment and intangible assets intangible asset total assets excluding assets of discontinued segments statistical terminology and information for cruise operations available passenger cruise days apcd apcd s are our measurement of capacity and represent double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period 
occupancy occupancy  in accordance with the cruise vacation industry practice  is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd 
a percentage in excess of indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins 
passenger cruise days passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days in their respective cruises 
selected windstar operational statistical information is as follows year ended december  passengers carried occupancy percentage passenger cruise days apcd results for the year ended december  compared to results for the year ended december  revenue total revenue from continuing operations in was million  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in revenue is primarily related to majestic america line which did not operate in and which generated million in revenues during our windstar cruises passenger revenue decreased million or from million in to million in onboard revenues decreased million or from million in to million in the reduction in windstar cruises passenger ticket revenues are primarily due to lower ticket prices and occupancy rates caused by current economic conditions and overall reduction in consumer discretionary spending 
cruise operating expenses cruise operating expenses represent direct costs incurred with owning and operating our cruise ships 
cruise operating expenses decreased million from million in to million in this reduction in overall expenditures is due to majestic america line vessels not operating in cruise operating expenses for windstar cruises decreased million or to million in from million in this reduction is attributable to lower fuel costs during and the transition of vessel management from a third party management company to in house personnel during the third quarter of selling and tour promotion selling and tour promotion expenses totaled million in  compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to the absence of promotion and marketing expenses for the majestic america line in selling and tour promotion expenses related to windstar cruises increased million in to million in from million in the increase in costs in is attributable to operational efforts targeted at increasing occupancy during the economic down turn 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million from million in to million in or 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in the decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the number of operating divisions and the consolidation of the corporate headquarters during insurance settlement during  we reached a settlement with an insurance company and received a million business interruption claim associated with sailing incidents involving the empress of the north and the queen of the west of the majestic american line 
there were no similar transactions for the year ended december  the insurance proceeds are reflected as a reduction in operating expenses from continuing operations in impairment charges during we recorded non cash impairment charges of million 
there were no comparable charges recorded in continuing operations during the year ended december  the charges are as follows million related to the three vessels of the windstar cruise fleet  million related to majestic america line vessels and million related to the windstar cruise trade name 
our impairment analysis of the long lived vessel assets included observable and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value under the market approach and income approach valuation techniques 
the market approach to estimate the fair value of the assets was based on observable inputs  including third party appraisal reports  sales of other vessels and estimated replacement value 
the company s income approach to estimate the fair value of the assets included a discounted cash flow model based on unobservable inputs and a range of future probabilities  including fluctuations in operating costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million recorded in the decrease is related to the disposition to marad of two majestic american line vessels in the later half of as well as the reduction in carrying value of certain majestic america line vessels during operating loss from continuing operations we reported an operating loss from continuing operations of million in compared to an operating loss from continuing operations of million in or an increase in operating losses of million year over year 
the primary driver of the current year operating loss is the non cash impairment charges of million described above 
operating loss from the cruise segment in includes a million net loss on the disposal of two majestic american line vessels upon the return of the vessels to marad 
other changes in operating losses from to are the result of events described above 
other income expense in we recorded other income expense of million compared to million in in november  we completed the exchange offer for million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes which were validly tendered and accepted 
in exchange for the tendered convertible notes  we issued approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and million shares of our common stock 
the difference between the carrying value of the convertible notes plus accrued interest at the time of the exchange and the senior notes  including future interest costs  the value of the common shares issued and less third party direct costs of the transaction  resulted in a gain on debt restructure of million during no similar transaction occurred in other expense during and includes million and million  respectively of interest expense related to our convertible notes 
the reduction of interest expense in reflects the exchange offer  including the reduction in interest due for the interest period from april  to completion of the exchange offer 
other income in consisted primarily of million in legal settlement related to the grounding of the empress of the north in march  million in settlement of the dispute related to the purchase of windstar cruises and million in insurance proceeds related to the empress of the north and queen of the west ship incidents in and no such legal settlements occurred in income taxes we recorded income tax expense of  and  respectively for the years ended december  and  attributable to continuing operations 
we recorded a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets as of december  and a significant factor in determining the requirement for the valuation allowance was our cumulative three year historical loss 
the establishment of a valuation allowance does not have any impact on cash  nor does such an allowance preclude us from utilizing any available loss carry forwards in the future 
the exchange offer constituted a change of control in ownership as defined by section g of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the ownership change has and will continue to subject our net operating loss carryforwards to an annual limitation  which will significantly restrict our ability to use them to offset taxable income in periods following the ownership change 
loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations was million in compared to million in or an increase of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the non cash impairment charge of million  offset by the non cash gain on debt restructure of million 
loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations was million during compared to a loss of million in the loss in is attributable primarily to losses incurred in the disposition of the marine group  travel and events and cypress re whereby the carrying value of the net assets sold or assigned were greater than the sales proceeds 
the loss in relates to the operating losses associated with the marine group which was attributable to an impairment and reduction in revenues and the operating losses of cypress re  offset by million in income from travel and events net loss net loss was million in compared to million in as a result of changes described above 
liquidity and capital resources due to the global downturn in the economy and other factors  we have restructured our long term indebtedness  restructured our operations  and obtained additional sources of financing 
the downturn in the economy and these restructuring activities have resulted in cash outflows from operating activities of million in and million in we have been successful in obtaining the million credit facility to provide funding for drydock costs for two windstar vessels as well as working capital and other corporate purposes 
additionally  in  we restructured a significant portion of the convertible notes in the exchange offer 
in addition to reducing outstanding indebtedness and obtaining the credit facility  we have restructured our core business activities so as to allow us to dedicate liquidity resources to the operations and growth of windstar cruises 
in  as in other years  we will incur capital expenditures and costs for improvements required in the maintenance of our ships 
in  planned capital expenditures and drydock projects are expected to be approximately million for our vessels 
we have a scheduled drydock in april for the wind sprit where we expect to incur million in refurbishments 
we also have a scheduled drydock project for the wind star in november where we expect to incur million in refurbishments 
we believe that the operating cash flows  financing cash flows  and investing cash flows projected for  and the cash and cash equivalents of million at december   including amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations through we expect our business improvement initiatives and other actions will improve our operating income and cash flow results 
however  the timing and extent of success for these strategies cannot be predicted with any level of certainty 
if we are unable to meet our cash flow projections in  we may need to seek additional sources of funding 
if the pricing or terms for any new financing do not meet our expectations  we may be required to choose between completion of the financing on such unfavorable terms or not completing the financing 
if sources of capital are unavailable  or are available only on a limited basis or under unacceptable terms  then we could be required to substantially reduce operating  marketing  general and administrative costs related to our continuing operations 
substantially all of our long term indebtedness is scheduled to mature or may need to be repaid during we do not expect that our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient funds to enable us to repay or repurchase this indebtedness when we are required to do so in accordingly  our ability to satisfy these obligations will depend upon our ability to refinance this indebtedness or to obtain additional funds through borrowings  sales of debt or equity securities  asset sales or other transactions 
term loan and revolving credit facility on march   we established a term loan and revolving credit facility for working capital purposes the credit facility  the terms of which are governed by a credit and guaranty agreement the credit agreement  by and among the company  our subsidiaries as borrowers and or guarantors  whippoorwill associates  inc and or certain funds and accounts managed by it whippoorwill as lenders and law debenture trust company of new york  as administrative agent and as collateral agent 
the credit facility provides for a million revolving credit facility and for a million term loan to be drawn in two tranches  all of which is to be used to fund dry dock costs for two windstar vessels as well as working capital and other corporate purposes of the company and its subsidiaries 
on march   the first tranche of the term loan  in the amount of million  was funded 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of percent per annum  are secured on a first priority basis by substantially all the assets of the company and its subsidiaries  and mature on january  the credit facility provides for payment of a annual facility fee to the lenders and customary agent fees 
the credit facility contains various restrictive and financial covenants  including a requirement that we achieve certain minimum ebitda levels and a limitation on our capital expenditures 
there are also restrictions regarding the use of the proceeds under the credit facility 
we plan to use a significant amount of the proceeds borrowed under the credit facility to fund our scheduled drydocks in april and november of  as discussed below 
cash flows net cash used in operations for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the million increase in cash flows from operations in compared to is primarily due to the increase in net loss adjusted for non cash related gains and losses incurred during the current year 
we made payments of million during in settlement of trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 
during  net cash used in operating activities reflects a million reduction in operating cash due to the decline in customer deposits for the cruise business activity 
net cash provided by investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities in was attributable to cash received in the release of collateral related to certificates of deposits previously required in the re insurance business and a reduction in amounts required by banks for credit card processing 
during cash from investing activities was also provided from the sale of a majestic american line vessel partially offset by activities in segments compromising discontinued operations prior to disposition 
net cash used in financing activities during was  related to activities in segments compromising discontinued operations prior to disposition 
net cash used in financing activities in totaled million  primarily attributable to repayments of long term debt 
as of december   we had an outstanding line of credit of  which is secured by a certificate of deposit in the same amount and is classified as restricted cash as of december  both the line of credit and certificate of deposit relate to insurance programs which expire at various dates through we have exited the re insurance business and expect to cancel the line of credit and receive funds from the certificate of deposit in our cruise passenger deposits are primarily received through credit card transactions 
as of december   we had million of restricted cash held by banks in cash equivalents required for secure processing of passenger deposits through credit cards 
the restricted amounts were negotiated between us and the banks based on a percentage of the expected future volume of credit card transactions within a standard twelve month period 
due to reductions in the insurance contract liabilities associated with our sold re insurance business  we were able to reduce certain letters of credit requirements during  this reduction made available million of cash that was previously restricted 
accordingly this reduction allowed us to reduce our bank line of credit that secured the letters of credit to  as of december  we currently are in compliance with all covenants under our senior convertible notes and senior secured notes and our credit facility 
off balance sheet transactions we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that will have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources
