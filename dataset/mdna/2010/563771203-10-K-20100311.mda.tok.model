item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our network marketing activities do not comply with government regulations  our business could suffer 
many governmental agencies regulate our network marketing activities 
a government agency s determination that our business or our independent associates have significantly violated a law or regulation could adversely affect our business 
the laws and regulations regulating network marketing generally intend to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes 
our business faces constant regulatory scrutiny due to the interpretive and enforcement discretion given to regulators  periodic misconduct by our independent associates  adoption of new laws or regulations  and changes in the interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations 
in july  the texas attorney general filed suit against us  mannarelief ministries  samuel l 
caster  the fisher institute  and h 
reginald mcdaniel alleging violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act and the texas food  drug and cosmetic act 
on february   we reached an agreement with the texas attorney general s office settling the enforcement action 
without admitting any wrongdoing  we have agreed to refund up to million to members who purchased company products between september  and august   and to pay million to cover fees and expenses of texas regulators 
the settlement does not include any f ine or penalty against the company 
we have also made and agreed to make certain corporate governance changes required by the texas attorney general s office and agreed not to violate certain provisions of the texas deceptive trade practices act and texas food  drug and cosmetic act 
if we are unable to comply fully with the provisions of the settlement  texas regulators could pursue further remedies that may impact our business 
in addition  in the past and as a result of the industry in which we operate  we have experienced inquiries regarding specific independent associates 
we have complied and fully cooperated with all regulatory agencies in connection with such inquiries and are also required by regulatory authorities to disclose any on going significant regulatory actions 
if government regulations regarding network marketing change or are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to our business  we may be subject to new enforcement actions and material limitations regarding our overall business model 
network marketing is always subject to extensive governmental regulations  including foreign  federal  and state regulations 
any change in legislation and regulations could affect our business 
furthermore  significant penalties could be imposed on us for failure to comply with various statutes or regulations 
violations may result from misconduct by us or our independent associates  ambiguity in statutes  regulations and related court decisions  the discretion afforded to regulatory authorities and courts interpreting and enforcing laws  and new regulations or interpretations of regulations affecting our business 
if we violate governmental regulations or fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  our operations could be adversely affected 
our operation is subject to extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions  and similar constraints at the federal  state  and local levels in our domestic and foreign markets 
these regulations primarily involve the following the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale  and storage of our products  the health and safety of dietary supplements  cosmetics and foods  trade practice laws and network marketing laws  our product claims and advertising by our independent associates  our network marketing system  pricing restrictions regarding transactions with our foreign subsidiaries or other related parties and similar regulations that affect our level of foreign taxable income  the assessment of customs duties  further taxation of our independent associates  which may obligate us to collect additional taxes and maintain additional records  and export and import restrictions 
any unexpected new regulations or changes in existing regulations could significantly restrict our ability to continue operations  which could adversely affect our business 
for example  changes regarding health and safety  and food and drug regulations for our nutritional products could require us to reformulate our products to comply with such regulations 
in some foreign countries  nutritional products are considered foods  while other countries consider them drugs 
future health and safety  or food and drug  regulations could delay or prevent our introduction of new products or suspend or prohibit the sale of existing products in a given country or marketplace 
in addition  if we expand into other foreign markets  our operations or products could also be affected by the general stability of foreign governments and the regulatory environment relating to network marketing and our products 
if our products are subject to high customs duties  our sales and competitive position could suffer as compared to locally produced goods 
furthermore  import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions could limit our ability to import products from the united states 
increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements as well as new regulations that are being adopted in some of our markets with respect to nutritional supplements could result in more restrictive regulations and harm our results if our supplements or advertising activities are found to violate existing or new regulations or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations 
there has been an increasing movement in the united states and other markets to increase the regulation of dietary supplements  which will impose additional restrictions or requirements 
in several of our markets  new regulations have been adopted or are likely to be adopted in the near term that will impose new requirements  make changes in some classifications of supplements under the regulations  or limit the claims we can make 
in addition  there has been increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements and marketing claims under existing and new regulations 
in europe for example  we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that have not been previously marketed in europe novel foods without going through an extensive registration and approval process 
europe is also expected to adopt additio nal regulations in the near future to set new limits on acceptable levels of nutrients 
the fda has implemented gmps for the us nutritional supplement industry 
our operations could be harmed if new regulations require us to reformulate products or effect new registrations  if regulatory authorities make determinations that any of our products do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations 
in addition  our operations could be harmed if governmental laws or regulations are enacted that restrict the ability of companies to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies 
if our international markets are not successful  our business could suffer 
we currently sell our products in the international markets of canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  germany  south africa  singapore  austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden 
nonetheless  our international operations could experience changes in legal and regulatory requirements  as well as difficulties in adapting to new foreign cultures and business customs 
if we do not adequately address such issues  our international markets may not meet growth expectations 
our international operations and future expansion plans are subject to political  economic  and social uncertainties  including inflation  the renegotiation or modification of various agreements  increases in custom duties and tariffs  changes and limits in export controls  government regulations and laws  trademark availability and registration issues  changes in exchange rates  changes in taxation  wars and other hostilities  and changes in the perception of network marketing 
any negative changes related to these factors could adversely affect our business  profitability  and growth prospects 
furthermore  any negative changes in our distribution channels may force us to invest significant time and money related to our distribution and sales to maintain our position in certain international markets 
if our information technology system fails  our operations could suffer 
like many companies  our business is heavily dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage and operate many of our key business functions  including order processing  supply chain management  customer service  product distribution  commission processing  cash receipts and payments  and financial reporting 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage and interruption from fires  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  and other events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
although we maintain an extensive security system and disaster recovery program that was developed under the guidelines published by the national institute of standards of technology  a long term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day to day business 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits 
in and  we recognized and  respectively  of our net sales in markets outside of the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the united states dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted average exchange rate 
if the united states dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies  there is a risk our reported sales  operating expenses  and net income could significantly fluctuate 
we are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations  nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations 
to date we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities 
we may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent associates  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our independent associates are subject to taxation and  in some instances  legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes  such as value added taxes  and to maintain appropriate tax records 
in addition  we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors 
in the event that local laws and regulations require us to treat our independent distributors as employees  or if our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities to be our employees rather than independent contractors we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions  plus any related assessments and penalties  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate significantly 
the price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases 
decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock 
the price of our common stock and the price at which we could sell securities in the future could significantly fluctuate in response to broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions  fluctuations in our financial results  future securities offerings  changes in the market s perception of our products or our business  including false or negative publicity  governmental regulatory actions  the outcome of any lawsuits  financial and business announcements made by us or our competitors  the general condition of the industry  and the sale of large amounts of stock by insiders 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies 
the changes sometimes appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock in the open market could fluctuate based on factors that have little or nothing to do with us or that are outside of our control 
certain shareholders  directors  and officers own a significant amount of our stock  which could allow them to influence corporate transactions and other matters 
as of december   our directors  executive officers  and a major shareholder  collectively with their families and affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our total outstanding common stock 
as a result  if any of these shareholders choose to act together based on their current share ownership  they may be able to control a significant percentage of the total outstanding shares of our common stock  which could affect the outcome of a shareholder vote on the election of directors  the adoption of stock option plans  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  or the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that may help discourage a change of control 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws  and the texas business organization code help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our company  even if the proposal may benefit our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval 
our board of directors has the power to determine the price and terms of any preferred stock 
the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholders approval could deter or delay unsolicited changes of control by discouraging open market purchases of our common stock or a non negotiated tender or exchange offer for our common stock 
discouraging open market purchases may be disadvantageous to our shareholders who may otherwise desire to participate in a transaction in w hich they would receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  other provisions may also discourage a change of control by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
our charter documents provide for three classes of directors on our board of directors with members of each class serving staggered three year terms 
also  the texas business organization code restricts  subject to exceptions  business combinations with any affiliated shareholder 
any or all of these provisions could delay  deter or help prevent a takeover of our company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors may decide not to declare dividends in the future 
the declaration of dividends on our common stock is solely within the discretion of our board of directors  subject to limitations under texas law stipulating that dividends may not be paid if payment therefore would cause the corporation to be insolvent or if the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation 
our board of directors may decide not to declare dividends or we could be prevented from declaring a dividend because of legal or contractual restrictions 
the failure to pay dividends could reduce our stock price 
our board of directors suspended dividends in august we may not resume payment of dividends in the future 
concentration risk a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our core ambrotose complex products which include the ambrotose products and advanced ambrotose products 
a decline in sales value of such legacy products could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position 
revenue from the core ambrotose products were as follows for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages sales by product of total net sales sales by product of total net sales advanced ambrotose ambrotose total we are not exposed to customer concentration risk as no single independent associate has ever accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales 
circumstances and conditions may change 
accordingly  additional risks and uncertainties not currently known  or that we currently deem not material  may also adversely affect our business operations

unless stated otherwise  all financial information presented below  throughout this report  and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes includes mannatech and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
company overview since november  we have continued to develop innovative  high quality  proprietary nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products that are sold through a global network marketing system operating in the united states  canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  germany  south africa  singapore  austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden 
the united states location processes orders for the united states  canada  and south africa 
the australian location processes orders for australia  new zealand  and singapore 
the united kingdom location processes orders for the united kingdom  denmark  germany  austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden 
the japan  republic of korea  and taiwan locations process orders for their local markets only 
the switzerland office was created to manage certain day to day business needs of non north american markets and coordinates our continued global expansion 
we conduct our business as a single operating segment and primarily sell our products through a network of approximately  independent associates and members who have purchased our products and or packs within the last months  which we refer to as current independent associates and members 
new recruits and pack sales are regarded as leading indicators for the long term success of our business 
new recruits include new independent associates and members purchasing our packs and products for the first time 
we operate as a seller of nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products through our network marketing distribution channels operating in sixteen different countries 
we review and analyze net sales by geographical location and by packs and products on a consolidated basis 
each of our subsidiaries sells the same types of products and exhibits similar economic characteristics  such as selling prices and gross margins 
because we sell our products through network marketing distribution channels  the opportunities and challenges that affect us most are recruitment of new and retention of existing independent associates and members  entry into new markets and growth of existing markets  niche market development  new product introduction  and investment in our infrastructure 
current economic conditions and recent developments 
during calendar year  the us and foreign economies slowed dramatically because of the global financial crisis 
the difficult conditions affecting the overall macro economic environment continued to impact our business in significant reduction in consumers disposable income impacted our customers spending practices  causing a decline in our revenues 
during and  in response to adverse market conditions  we implemented various initiatives to reduce expenses  including the suspension of matching contributions under our k employee savings plan  reduction in workforce  and cutback of other discretionary costs such as outside services  travel and overtime 
we also reduced the level of our quarterly cash dividend in and suspended the dividend in august of while we focus all funding on the growth of the business 
by establishing a culture of expense control and accountability  we achieved a significant decrease in operating costs in and positioned our business to generate incremental profits as sales increase 
our intent is to maintain a strong level of expense control and systematically review all expenditures with the goal of prudently managing our business 
at the same time  we remain committed to our strategic plan of developing new  innovative  and scientifically validated products  international expansion  strengthening financial results  and adding value to our shareholders and independent associates 
we continued expansion into new international markets and  on september   began selling products in austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden 
among the available products are the company s advanced ambrotose capsules and powder  ambrotose ao capsules  phytomatrix caplets  plus tablets and osolean fat loss powder 
our expansion to million people through the combined populations of these four additional markets increases our independent associates ability to build their businesses in europe 
entry into these four countries compliments our existing presence in the united kingdom  germany  and denmark while highlighting our continued focus on global expansion 
we continue to focus on new product development 
in the third quarter of  we launched essential source omega  which provides epa dha essential fatty acids 
in the fourth quarter  we launched our newest product  phytoburst nutritional chews 
phytoburst chews are soft lemon and mixed berry flavored supplements designed to support the modern diet with balanced nutrition from a food sourced vitamin complex  minerals  phytonutrients  and antioxidants 
sales of bounce back capsules and osolean powder  two products introduced in  also remained strong in in addition to our innovative product development  we continue to invest in research for our existing products 
recent results of a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study validated that ambrotose has beneficial effects on the immune system  digestive tract  and cognitive functioning 
ambrotose  a glyconutrient product originally launched in  is still our best selling product 
five additional clinical and pre clinical studies are scheduled to be conducted in we strive to ensure all of our products meet the strictest quality guidelines 
in the third quarter of  bounce back capsules received nsf certification and became the ninth mannatech products to receive this designation 
nsf international is an independent  not for profit  public health certification organization that ensures a product s label accurately reflects the contents of the supplement  that all ingredients are openly disclosed on the label 
additionally  nsf assesses each manufacturing site to ensure it complies with good manufacturing practices and will not certify a product unless the manufacturer passes these audits 
nsf certifications exemplify our commitment to offering our customers the highest quality products 
we intend to carry the nsf certification mark on the supplements labels and promotional materials 
we will continue to seek nsf certification on our entire product line to demonstrate the ultimate quality of mannatech products 
we remain committed to providing value to our independent associates 
in january  we announced a new  simplified offering  which features a premium all star pack in united states  canada  and south africa 
developed in response to the current economic crisis  this more affordable pack includes more than in products 
the enhanced compensation plan allows independent sales associates to start their business building opportunity in the wellness industry at a lower cost 
the new premium all star pack has proven to be popular and is responsible for an improvement in domestic pack sales as well as recruiting in increases in pack sales and recruiting are leading indicators of future long term profitable growth 
we have realigned our management structure to provide a stronger foundation for growth and better align our organization with our long term goals 
in november of  we created a new senior executive office comprised of three executives  including chief financial officer steve fenstermacher and chief science officer dr 
rob sinnott as co ceos and randy bancino  senior vice president  as president of global business operations and expansion 
as co ceos  mr 
fenstermacher and dr 
sinnott act collectively as our chief executive officers and are responsible for overall operations of the company 
mr 
bancino reports to mr 
fenstermacher and dr 
sinnott 
various management responsibilities are shared between these three officers to better serve our strategic objectives 
we believe this new management structure will best utilize the diverse s kill sets of three of our most seasoned executives 
in addition  we continue to improve management and in september claire zevalkink joined mannatech as senior vice president and chief global marketing officer 
ms 
zevalkink has extensive executive experience in the multi level marketing industry that includes marketing  global brand management  brand communications  new business development and sales training 
we believe that efficiencies gained from these organizational changes will help us to improve cost controls and distinguish us in the marketplace by adding emphasis on brand management  associate recruitment  supply chain excellence  new product development  and international expansion 
we believe aggressive cost reduction  new product introduction  international expansion  improved associate recruitment  financial discipline  and organizational realignment will enable us to effectively manage through the challenging economy 
we believe these recent changes to our business model will position us to support future long term profitable growth 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the tables below summarize our consolidated operating results in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages 
change total dollars of net sales total dollars of net sales dollar percentage net sales cost of sales commissions and incentives gross profit operating expenses selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization other operating costs total operating expenses loss from operations interest income other income expense  net loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss for geographical purposes  consolidated net sales primarily shipped to customers by location for the years ended december  and were as follows in millions  except percentages net sales in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales united states japan republic of korea canada australia south africa taiwan new zealand united kingdom germany denmark singapore austria norway the netherlands sweden totals south africa began operations in may singapore began operations in november austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden began operations in september net sales for the year ended december   our operations outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales  whereas in the same period in  our operations outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
consolidated net sales for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in domestic sales decreased million  while international sales decreased million 
despite this overall decrease  we have a positive outlook for future growth and increasing net sales as we continue to develop innovative products  actively recruit new associates  and expand internationally 
fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates had an overall unfavorable impact on our net sales of approximately million for year ended december  the net sales impact is calculated as the difference between the current period s net sales in usd and the current period s net sales in local currencies converted to usd by applying average exchange rates for the year ended december  net sales by country in local currency for the year ended december  and were as follows in millions  except percentages change country currency local currency percentage australia and singapore aud austria  germany  netherlands eur denmark dkk japan jpy korea krw new zealand nzd norway nok south africa zar sweden sek taiwan twd united kingdom gbp singapore began operations in november austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden began operations in september south africa began operations in may our total sales and sales mix can be influenced by any of the following changes in our sales prices  changes in consumer demand  changes in the number of independent associates and members  changes in competitors products  changes in economic conditions  changes in regulations  announcements of new scientific studies and breakthroughs  introduction of new products  discontinuation of existing products  adverse publicity  changes in our commissions and incentives programs  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our sales mix for the years ended december  was as follows in millions  except percentages change dollar percentage product sales pack sales other  including freight total net sales although there was an overall decrease in consolidated net sales for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  which was primarily due to a decline in the volume of product sales  there was an increase in pack sales  creating a positive outlook for future product sales 
pack sales generally correlate to new independent associates who purchase starter packs and to continuing independent associates who purchase upgrade or renewal packs 
however  there is no direct correlation between product sales and the number of new and continuing independent associates and members because independent associates and members utilize products at different volumes 
product sales substantially all of our product sales are made to independent associates at published wholesale prices 
we also sell our products to independent members at discounted published retail prices 
for the year ended december   product sales decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the same period in the million decrease in product sales was comprised of a decrease in existing product sales of million and a decrease in new product sales of million 
we believe the decrease in product sales was primarily due to the macro economic factors negatively impacting our company 
the following new products were introduced during mannatech optimal skin care system products in certain international markets  osolean powder and or osolean single use packets in all of our markets  various promotional packages in united states  canada  south africa  taiwan  and australia  health solutions starter packs in australia  singapore  and new zealand  glycoslim drink mix in certain international markets  emprizone in japan  essential source omega in united states  canada  and south africa  phytoburst nutritional chews in united states  canada and south africa  gi probalance in south korea  and various optimal health  weight and fitness products in austria  the netherlands  norway and sweden  pack sales packs may be purchased by our independent associates who wish to build a mannatech business 
these packs are offered to our independent associates at a discount from published retail prices 
there are several pack options available to our associates 
in certain markets  pack sales are concluded during the associate registration process and can provide new associates with valuable training and promotional materials  as well as products for resale to retail customers  demonstration purposes  and personal consumption 
business building associates can also purchase an upgrade pack  which provides associates with additional promotional materials and eligibility for additional commissions and incentives 
many of our business building independent associates also choose to purchase renewal packs to satisfy annual renewal requirements to continue to earn various commissions 
pack sales associated with the number of independent associates can be analyzed as follows  for the years ended december in millions except percentages and independent associate information number of independent associates and members pack sales number of independent associates and members pack sales percentage and dollar change of pack sales new continuing total total pack sales for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  as compared to million for the same period in the overall increase in total pack sales was composed of an increase of million related to a larger number of new independent associates purchasing starter packs  offset by a decrease of million related to a decline in the number of renewal and upgrade packs purchased by our continuing independent associates 
the number of new and continuing independent associates and members who purchased our packs and or products during the twelve months ended december  was as follows new continuing total although there was an overall decrease of  or  for the year ended december  in associate activity as compared to the same period in  which was due to fewer continuing independent associates and members  we had an increase in the number of new recruits 
we consider new recruits to be a leading indicator of continued long term success due to anticipated future sales

the provisions of topic require a company to record a valuation allowance when the more likely than not criterion for realizing net deferred tax assets cannot be met 
furthermore  the weight given to the potential effect of such evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
as a result  we reviewed the operating results  as well as all of the positive and negative evidence related to realization of such deferred tax assets to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in each tax jurisdiction 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets as a result of new tax legislation that allowed the carry back of net operating losses for five years instead of two 
this reversal resulted in an increase in tax benefit of approximately million for the quarter and year ended december  as of december  and  we maintained our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the following table in millions  as we believe the more likely than not criterion for recognition and realization purposes  as defined in topic  cannot be met

as a result  in april  we began recording deferred revenue related to packs with pack sales and deferred revenue associated with products with product sales 
for the three months ended march   other sales included million related to the change in deferred revenue for packs and products shipped but not yet received by customers  rather than in the applicable pack or product sales category 
the decrease in our consolidated net sales consisted of a decrease in the volume of products and packs sold and a change in the mix of packs and products sold 
pack sales generally correlate to the number of new independent associates and members who purchase starter packs and to the number of continuing independent associates who purchase upgrade or renewal packs 
however  there is no direct correlation between product sales and the number of new and continuing independent associates and members because independent associates and members utilize products at different volumes 
product sales for the year ended december   product sales decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the same period in the million decrease in product sales was comprised of a decrease in existing product sales of million and a decrease attributable to the million cost of introducing the new products set forth below

for the year ended december   other sales decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in product and pack shipments  which more than offset the increase in freight charged per shipment 
the decrease in other sales is also related to the classification of deferred revenue of million for pack and product sales  which was partially offset by an increase in income related to a transactional tax holiday for certain sales occurring in gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit decreased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net sales  which correlates to the decrease in cost of sales  decrease in commissions  and decrease in incentives as compared to the same period in for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to as compared to for the same period in cost of sales decreased during the year ended december  by  or million to million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decline in product cost of million

these compensation related costs were offset by a decrease in temporary and contract labor of approximately million  as well as a decrease in stock option expense of million  all of which were due to the conversion of a number of temporary and contract labor positions to permanent employees  normal merit increase s  decreased capitalization of salaries for the development of our new enterprise resource planning system  and costs related to staff reduction 
this net increase was offset by a decrease in freight costs of million due to a decrease in product and pack shipments  and a decrease in marketing costs of million  which related to a change in distribution of an internal publication to associates  a reduction in cost related to corporate sponsored events  and a reduction in the cost associated with advertising materials and printing

as of december  and  we maintained our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in taiwa n totaling million and million  respectively  as we believe the more likely than not criterion for recognition and realization purposes  as defined in fasb asc topic  cannot be met 
the dollar amount of the provisions for income taxes is directly related to our profitability and changes in taxable income among countries 
for the year ended december   our effective income tax rate decreased to from for the same period in for  the company s effective income tax rate was lower than what would be expected if the federal statutory income tax rate were applied to income before taxes primarily because of favorable differences from foreign operations 
for  the company s effective income tax rate was higher than what would be expected if the federal statutory income tax rate were applied to income before taxes primarily because of unfavorable permanent items from foreign operations 
seasonality we believe the impact of seasonality on our consolidated results of operations is minimal 
we have experienced and believe we will continue to experience variations on our quarterly results of operations in response to  among other things the timing of the introduction of new products and incentives  our ability to attract and retain associates and members  the timing of our incentives and contests  the general overall economic outlook  government regulations  the outcome of certain lawsuits  the perception and acceptance of network marketing  and the consumer perception of our products and overall operations 
as a result of these and other factors  our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future 
period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance since we can give no assurances that revenue trends in new markets  as well as in existing markets  will follow our historical patterns 
the market price of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the above factors 
liquidity and capital resources our principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses  including commissions and incentives  capital assets  inventory purchases  and international expansion and to pay quarterly cash dividends 
we generally fund our business objectives  operations  and expansion of our operations through net cash flows from operations rather than incurring long term debt 
we plan to continue to fund our needs through net cash flows from operations 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents that can be used  along with normal cash flows from operations  to fund any unanticipated shortfalls in future cash flows 
although our cash has been impacted by net losses for most of  we saw our costs  particularly commissions and incentives  return to more historical levels 
operating at these historical levels has helped us generate a positive operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of although we are contemplating alternative liquidity sources  remaining at these historical cost levels will be a key factor in our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations 
in addition  we reduced capital spending and plan to file for a substantial federal income tax refund 
cash and cash equivalents and investments as of december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  or million  to million from million as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was related to the acquisition of additional inventory  purchases of property and equipment  the decrease in accrued expenses due to the timing of payments  the payment of dividends and the payment of litigation settlements of approximately million 
as of december  and december   our investments have all been converted to cash equivalents 
working capital working capital represents total current assets less total current liabilities 
at december   our working capital decreased by million  or  to million from million at december  the decrease in working capital primarily related to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in deferred tax assets and prepaid expenses  and an increase in accounts payable and taxes payable 
net cash flows our net consolidated cash flows consisted of the following  for the years ended december in millions provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities the operating  investing  and financing activities are described in more detail below 
operating activities for the years ended december    and  our net operating activities used cash of million and million and provided cash of  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  net earnings adjusted for noncash activities used cash of million and million and provided cash of  respectively  and our working capital accounts used cash of million and million and provided cash of million  respectively 
we expect that our net operating cash flows in will be sufficient to fund our current operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 
certain events  such as the uncertainty of the worldwide economic environment  could impact our available cash or our ability to generate cash flows from operations 
investing activities for the years ended december    and  our net investing activities used cash of million and provided cash of million and used cash of million  respectively 
in  we used cash of million to purchase capital assets and we had a decrease in restricted cash of million 
in  we converted our long term investments to cash and cash equivalents  providing cash of million  which was partially offset by the acquisition of capital assets of million 
in  we used cash of million to purchase capital assets and million as collateral for credit card payments in the republic of korea  which was partially offset by sales of investments of million 
in  we anticipate using cash of up to million to purchase other capital assets for use in our operations  expansion of our corporate facilities  and planned international expansion 
financing activities in  we used cash of million to fund payment of cash dividends to our shareholders and million for repayment of capital lease obligations 
the amount of cash used was partially offset by the receipt of million in stock option exercise transactions 
in  we used cash of million to fund our net financing activities 
during  we used cash of million to fund payment of quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders and used cash of million to repay capital leases 
in  we used cash of million to fund our net financing activities 
during  we used cash of million to fund payment of quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders and used cash of million to repay capital leases 
these uses of cash were partially offset by receiving cash of million and recording an income tax benefit of million related to option holders exercising their stock options 
general liquidity and cash flows we believe our existing liquidity and cash flows from operations are adequate to fund our normal expected future business operations and possible international expansion costs for the next to months 
however  if our existing capital resources or cash flows become insufficient to meet current business plans  projections  and existing capital requirements  we may be required to raise additional funds  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations 
the following summarizes our future commitments and obligations associated with various agreements and contracts as of december   for the years ending december in thousands thereafter total capital lease obligations purchase obligations operating leases post employment royalty employment agreements texas attorney general settlement total commitments and obligations purchase obligations for the years   and include million  million  and million  respectively  of purchase commitments under a contract terminated by the company for an asserted breach 
pursuant to the terms of the contract  we are engaged in the arbitration process with the supplier 
we have maintained purchase commitments with certain raw material suppliers to purchase minimum quantities and to ensure exclusivity of our raw materials and the proprietary nature of our products 
currently  we have four supply agreements that require minimum purchase commitments 
we terminated one of these contracts for an asserted breach in and are now engaged in the arbitration process with the supplier 
we also maintain other supply agreements and manufacturing agreements to protect our products  regulate product costs  and help ensure quality control standards 
these agreements do not require us to purchase any set minimums 
we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to acquisitions or purchases of any manufacturing facilities  however  management from time to time explores the possibility of the bene fits of purchasing a raw material manufacturing facility to help control costs of our raw materials and help ensure quality control standards 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entity arrangements  nor do we have any off balance sheet arrangements 
market risks please see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk under item a of this form k for additional information about our market risks 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates throughout our financial statements  which are influenced by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates are based on historical trends  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are applicable and reasonable under the circumstances at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our audit committee reviews our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we continually evaluate and review our policies related to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations that require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we also analyze the need for certain estimates  including the need for such items as allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  long lived fixed assets and capitalization of internal use software development costs  reserve for uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances  revenue recognition  sales returns  and deferred revenues  accounting for stock based compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
historically  actual results have not materially deviated from our estimates 
however  we caution readers that actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if circumstances change relating to the various assumptions or condi tions used in our estimates  we could experience an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have identified the following applicable critical accounting policies and estimates as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is carried at estimated collectible amounts and primarily consists of receivables from independent associates and members 
as of december   net accounts receivable totaled million 
we simultaneously receive payment for an order when the order ships 
if the payment is rejected or if it does not match the order total  a receivable is created 
we periodically review receivables for realizability and base collectability upon assumptions  historical trends  and recent account activities 
if our estimates regarding estimated collectability are inaccurate or consumer trends change in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional write offs or bad debts 
as of december   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of less than million 
inventory reserves inventory consists of raw materials  work in progress  finished goods  and promotional materials that are stated at the lower of cost using standard costs that approximate average costs or market 
we record the amounts charged by the vendors as the costs of inventory 
typically  the net realizable value of our inventory is higher than the aggregate cost 
determination of net realizable value can be complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of net realizable value  the following items are considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer demand  regulatory changes  competitive pricing  and performance of similar products 
if we determine the carrying value of inventory is in excess of estimated net realizable value  we write down the value of inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
we also review inventory for obsolescence in a similar manner and any inventory identified as obsolete is reserved or written off 
our determination of obsolescence is based on assumptions about the demand for our products  product expiration dates  estimated future sales  and general future plans 
we monitor actual sales compared to original projections  and if actual sales are less favorable than those originally projected by us  we record an additional inventory reserve or write down 
historically  our estimates have been close to our actual reported amounts 
however  if our estimates regarding inventory obsolescence are inaccurate or consumer demand for our products changes in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional material losses or gains in excess of our established estimated inventory reserves 
at december  and  our inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
long lived fixed assets and capitalization of software development costs in addition to capitalizing long lived fixed asset costs  we also capitalize costs associated with internally developed software projects collectively fixed assets and amortize such costs over the estimated useful lives of such fixed assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation computed using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
if a fixed asset is sold or otherwise retired or disposed of  the cost of the fixed asset and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is written off and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in other operating costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
we review our fixed assets for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable  such as plans to dispose of an asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
our impairment review includes a comparison of future projected cash flows generated by the asset  or group of assets  with its associated net carrying value 
if the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the fair value is determined by calculating the discounted expected future cash flows using an estimated risk free rate of interest 
any identified impairment losses are recorded in the period in which t he impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the fixed asset is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value of the fixed asset are not recorded 
in addition  if we determine the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be reduced from our original estimate  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively  based on the new remaining useful life of the fixed asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives  and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge  which could be material to our results of operations 
in addition  if accounting standards change  or if fixed assets become obsolete  we may be required to write off any unamortized costs of fixed assets  or if estimated useful lives change  we would be required to accelerate depreciation or amortization periods and recognize additional depreciation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
historically  our estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets have not materially deviated from actual results 
as of december   the estimated useful lives and net carrying values of fixed assets are as follows estimated useful life net carrying value at december  office furniture and equipment to years million computer hardware and software to years million automobiles to years million leasehold improvements to years million construction in progress to years million total net carrying value at december  million we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful estimated life of the leased asset or the lease term 
construction in process includes leasehold improvements and internally developed software costs 
once placed in service  leasehold improvements will be amortized over the shorter of an asset s useful life or the remaining lease term 
once the internally developed software is placed in service  it will be amortized over three to five years 
the net carrying costs of fixed assets and construction in progress are exposed to impairment losses if our assumptions and estimates of their carrying values change  there is a change in estimated future cash flow  or there is a change in the estimated useful life of the fixed asset 
we determined that no impairment indicators existed during the years ended december    and uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances as of december   we recorded million in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to uncertain income tax positions 
as required by topic  we use judgments and make estimates and assumptions related to evaluating the probability of uncertain income tax positions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the potential liability related to an assessment of whether the income tax position will more likely than not be sustained in an income tax audit 
we are also subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluatio n of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years 
therefore  our estimated reserve balances and liability related to uncertain income tax positions may exist for multiple years before the applicable statute of limitations expires or before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
we believe our tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions are based upon reasonable judgment and estimates  however  if actual results materially differ  our effective income tax rate and cash flows could be affected in the period of discovery or resolution 
we also review the estimates and assumptions used in evaluating the probability of realizing the future benefits of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance when we believe that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
if we are unable to realize the expected future benefits of our deferred tax assets  we are required to provide a valuation allowance 
we use our past history and experience  overall profitability  future management plans  and current economic information to evaluate the amount of valuation allowance to record 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from our operations of million because they did not meet the more likely than not criteria as defined by the recognition and measurement provisions of topic in addition  as of december   we had deferred tax assets  after valuation allowance  totaling million  which may not be realized if our assumptions and estimates change  which would affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in the period of discovery or resolution 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue we derive revenues from sales of our products  sales of our starter and renewal packs  shipping fees  and corporate sponsored events 
substantially all of our product and pack sales are made to independent associates at published wholesale prices 
we also sell products to independent members at discounted published retail prices 
we record revenue net of any sales taxes 
we recognize revenue from shipped packs and products upon receipt by the customer 
we recognize revenue related to future corporate sponsored events when the event is held 
our deferred revenue primarily consists of i revenue received from sales of packs and products shipped but not received by the customers at period end  and ii revenue received from prepaid registration fees from customers planning to attend a future corporate sponsored event 
at december   total deferred revenue was million 
significant changes in our shipping methods could result in additional revenue deferrals 
we have three different product return policies which are described in detail on this form k in the item i business section under associate distribution system and product return policy 
historically  sales returns estimates have not materially deviated from actual sales returns 
based upon our return policies  we estimate a sales return reserve for expected sales refunds based on our historical experience over a rolling six month period 
if actual results differ from our estimated sales returns reserves due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded each period could be materially affected 
historically  our sales returns have not materially changed through the years as the majority of our customers who return their merchandise do so within the first days after the o riginal sale 
sales returns average or less of our gross sales 
for the year ended december   our sales refund reserve and actual returns were as follows in thousands sales reserve as of december  current provision related to sales made in current provision related to sales made prior to actual returns or credits in related to actual returns or credits in related to prior periods sales reserve as of december  accounting for stock based compensation we grant stock options to our employees and board members 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of a stock option award and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of such stock option award  which is two to four years 
the fair value of the stock option award is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  calculated fair value 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock option life  expected volatility  expected average risk free interest rates  and expected forfeiture rates 
for the year ended december   our assumptions and estimates used for the calculated fair value of stock options granted in were as follows january grant february grant march grant june grant september grant december grant estimated fair value per share of options granted assumptions annualized dividend yield risk free rate of return common stock price volatility expected average life of stock options in years historically  our estimates and underlying assumptions have not materially deviated from our actual reported results and rates 
however  the assumptions we use are based on our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions we use  the stock based compensation expense reported in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of stock based compensation 
for example  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may be required to make an adjustment to our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
as of december   using our current assumptions and estimates  we anticipate recognizing million in gross compensati on expense through related to unvested stock options outstanding 
if we grant additional stock options in the future  we would be required to recognize additional compensation expense over the vesting period of such stock options in our consolidated statement of operations 
gross compensation expense would equal the calculated fair value of such stock options  which is dependent on the assumptions used to calculate such fair value  but generally ranges between to of the exercise price multiplied by the number of stock options awarded 
as of december   we had  shares available for grant in the future 
contingencies and litigation each quarter  we evaluate the need to establish a reserve for any legal claims or assessments 
we base our evaluation on our best estimates of the potential liability in such matters 
the legal reserve includes an estimated amount for any damages and the probability of losing any threatened legal claims or assessments 
the legal reserve is developed in consultation with our general and outside counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our legal reserves and accruals are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
if actual results differ  if circumstances change  or if we experience an unanticipated adverse outcome of any legal action  including any claim or assessment  we would be required to recognize the estimated amount that could reduce net income  earnings per share  and cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase investments as hedges or for purposes other than trading that are likely to expose us to certain types of market risk  including interest rate  commodity price  or equity price risk 
although we have investments  we believe there has been no material change in our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have not issued any debt instruments  entered into any forward or futures contracts  purchased any options  or entered into any swap agreements 
we are exposed  however  to other market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
because the change in value of the united states dollar measured against foreign currency may affect our consolidated financial results  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could positively or negatively affect our results as expressed in united states dollars 
for example  when the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies in which our products are sold or weakens against foreign currencies in which we may incur costs  our consolidated net sales or related costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our consolidated operations or profitability

the japan  republic of korea  and taiwan locations process orders for their local markets only 
we translate our revenues and expenses in foreign markets using an average rate 
we maintain policies  procedures  and internal processes in an effort to help monitor any significant market risks and we do not use any financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we assess the anticipated foreign currency working capital requirements of our foreign operations and maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies sufficient to satisfy most of these anticipated requirements 
we caution that we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to such currency exchange rate fluctuations or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  operating expenses  and on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  to combat such market risk  we closely monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
the foreign currencies in which we currently have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk include the currencies of canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  germany  south africa  singapore  austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden 
the current spot rate  average currency exchange rates  and the low and high of such currency exchange rates as compared to the united stat es dollar  for each of these countries as of and for the year ended december  were as follows country foreign currency name low high average spot australia dollar austria  germany  the netherlands euro canada dollar denmark krone japan yen new zealand dollar norway krone republic of korea won singapore dollar south africa rand sweden krona switzerland franc taiwan dollar united kingdom british pound
