item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
our actual results may differ materially because of a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in part i  item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
overview 
we seek to increase shareholder value through consistent growth in our production and reserves  both through the drill bit and acquisitions 
we strive to operate our properties in an efficient manner to maximize the cash flow and earnings of our assets 
the strategies to accomplish these goals include maximize production from our base oil assets grow oil production from our inventory of organic development projects increase natural gas production that will meet the growing demand for steam generation invest our capital in a disciplined manner and maintain a strong financial position acquire additional resources with an emphasis on crude oil notable items in achieved total production averaging  boe d  of which is crude oil production  with million of capital investment added million boe of proved reserves  ending at million boe drilled wells in the diatomite  increasing production over levels to average  boe d in acquired property and initiated a steam flood pilot near mckittrick  california with development potential similar to our poso creek asset acquired deep rights on our e

table of contents overview of the fourth quarter of we had net income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  and cash provided from operations of million in the fourth quarter of net income from continuing operations includes million related to an unrealized gain on ineffective hedges and impairment charges of million related to the write down of a rig and the write down of expired leases 
also included in the fourth quarter of are adjustments to correct the prior accounting for our royalties in the amount of million  net of tax  which resulted in decreasing our sales of oil and gas and increasing our royalties payable 
we drilled gross wells  and capital expenditures  excluding property acquisitions  totaled million 
we achieved average production of  boe d in the fourth quarter of  up from the third quarter of revenue and production 
revenues 
approximately of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil and natural gas production under either negotiated contracts or spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
approximately of our revenues are derived from electricity sales from cogeneration facilities which supply approximately of our steam requirement for use in our california thermal heavy oil operations 
we have invested in these facilities for the purpose of lowering our steam costs  which are significant in the production of heavy crude oil 
the remaining of our revenues are primarily derived from gas marketing sales which represent our excess capacity on the rockies express pipeline which we used to market natural gas for our working interest partners 
sales of oil and gas decreased in compared to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices resulted in a decrease in sales of oil and natural gas 
the decrease was offset by an increase in production volumes 
approximately of our oil and gas sales volumes in were crude oil  with of the crude oil being heavy oil produced in california which was sold under various contracts with prices tied to the san joaquin posted price

production from continuing operations decreased  or  boe d  for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  primarily due to production decreases in the uinta basin and the piceance basin where there was very little capital activity during production from continuing operations increased  or boe d  for the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of primarily due to development activities during the fourth quarter of that resulted in an increase in the diatomite 
electricity 
electricity revenues and operating costs decreased in the year ended compared to the year ended as a result of lower electricity prices and lower natural gas prices 
electricity revenues and operating costs increased in the year ended compared to the year ended due to higher electricity prices and higher natural gas prices 
we purchased approximately mmbtu d as fuel for use in our cogeneration facilities for the year ended december  and the year ended december  in and  our electricity operations improved partially from the lower cost of the firm transportation natural gas we purchased 
we purchase and transport  average mmbtu d on the kern river pipeline under our firm transportation contract and use this gas to produce conventional and cogeneration steam in the midway sunset field 
the differential between rocky mountain gas prices and southern california border prices decreased during compared to and in compared to 
table of contents the following table is for the years ended december electricity revenues in millions operating costs in millions decrease to total oil and gas operating expenses per barrel electric power produced mwh d electric power sold mwh d average sales price mwh no hedging was in place fuel gas cost mmbtu including transportation royalties 
a price sensitive royalty burdens certain of our s 
midway properties which produced approximately  boe d in this royalty was of the amount of the heavy oil posted price above a base price which was in this royalty rate was reduced to effective january  as long as we maintain a minimum steam injection level 
we met the steam injection level in and expect to meet the requirement going forward 
this base price escalates at annually  thus the threshold price is per barrel in liabilities payable for these royalties were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in the fourth quarter of are adjustments to correct the prior accounting for our royalties in the amount of million  which resulted in decreasing our sales of oil and gas and increasing our royalties payable 
management concluded the impact was immaterial to the current and prior periods 
in the first quarter of  we determined there was an error in computing royalties payable in prior years  accumulating to million as of december  we concluded the error was not material to any individual prior interim or annual period or to the projected earnings for and  therefore  the error was corrected during the first quarter of  with the effect of increasing our sales of oil and gas by million and reducing our royalties payable 
oil and gas operating and other expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table presents information about our continuing operating expenses for each of the years ended december amount per boe amount in thousands change change operating costs oil and gas production production taxes dd a oil and gas production g a interest expense total operating costs steam costs are the primary variable component of our operating costs and fluctuate based on the amount of steam we inject and the price of fuel used to generate steam 
the following table presents steam information change average volume of steam injected bbl d fuel gas cost mmbtu including transportation approximate net fuel gas volume consumed in steam generation mmbtu d operating costs decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in fuel gas cost which is directly correlated to a decrease in natural gas prices 
production taxes production taxes have decreased over the last year as the value of our oil and natural gas has decreased 
severance taxes in utah  colorado and texas are directly related to the field sales price of the commodity 
in california  our production is burdened with ad valorem taxes on our total proved reserves 
we expect production taxes to track oil and natural gas prices generally 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased per boe in by from due to an increase in the contribution of our development properties with higher drilling and leasehold acquisition costs and the integration of our e 
texas assets which have higher finding and development costs than our legacy assets 
general and administrative approximately of our g a is related to compensation 
the primary reason for the decrease in g a during was a decrease in employee headcount primarily associated with the sale of our dj assets  offset by a liability of million that was established during the second quarter of for a regulatory compliance matter 
in we moved our corporate headquarters from bakersfield  california to denver  colorado and approximately million was related to relocation of our employees and related expenses 
also included in g a in was million in rig termination penalties that we incurred during the fourth quarter of and million for costs we incurred to evaluate the formation of a master limited partnership 
interest expense our total outstanding borrowings were approximately billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase in interest expense between periods is due to the amortization of additional debt issuance costs and amortization of the net discount  which were incurred in june and august in connection with the issuance of our senior notes due in as well as a higher interest rate on the senior notes issued compared to the interest rate on the credit facility 
debt extinguishment costs during the years ended december  and  we recorded debt extinguishment costs of million and  respectively 
these costs related to credit facility borrowing base changes  issuance of senior unsecured notes  and pay off of our second lien term loan 
dry hole  abandonment  impairment and exploration in we had dry hole  abandonment and impairment charges of million primarily due to a million impairment charge related to the write down of a rig to its fair market value see note fair value measurement 
we incurred exploration costs in of million compared to million in these costs consist primarily of geological and geophysical costs 
in we had dry hole  abandonment  impairment and exploration charges of million consisting primarily of million for technical difficulties that were encountered on five wells in piceance before reaching total depth 
these holes were abandoned in favor of drilling to the same bottom hole location by drilling new wells 
due to the release of our rigs we performed an impairment test which resulted in million of impairment costs resulting from the impairment of one rig 
we incurred exploration costs of million in both and these costs consist primarily of geological and geophysical costs 
bad debt expense 
we recorded and million of bad debt expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million recorded in bad debt expense for the year ended december  was related to the bankruptcy of bwoc 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate between periods is due to reduced state rates and the reduction in our liability related to uncertain tax positions 
our estimated annual effective tax rate varies from the federal statutory rate due to the effects of state income taxes and estimated permanent differences 
see note to the financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years ended december amount per boe amount in thousands change change operating costs oil and gas production production taxes dd a oil and gas production g a interest expense total 
table of contents our total operating costs  production taxes  g a and interest expenses for  stated on a unit of production basis  increased over the changes were primarily related to the following items operating costs our operating costs increased primarily due to higher contract services and labor costs  higher compression  gathering  and dehydration costs and higher steam costs resulting from higher volumes of injected steam 
of the million increase in operating expense compared to  approximately million was due to higher steam costs and approximately million was due to the addition of our e 
texas assets 
on a per barrel basis  e 
texas operating costs approximate mcf and reduces our overall cost per barrel 
the following table presents steam information change average volume of steam injected bbl d fuel gas cost mmbtu including transportation production taxes production taxes increased over as the value of our oil and natural gas increased 
severance taxes  which are prevalent in utah and colorado  are directly related to the field sales price of the commodity 
in california  our production is burdened with ad valorem taxes on our total proved reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased per boe in by from due to an increase in capital spending in fields with higher drilling and leasehold acquisition costs 
general and administrative in  approximately of our g a was related to compensation 
the primary reason for the increase in g a during was a increase in employee headcount associated with our e 
texas acquisition and the development of our assets 
in we moved our corporate headquarters from bakersfield  california to denver  colorado and approximately million was incurred during the fourth quarter of million for costs we incurred to evaluate the formation of a master limited partnership 
interest expense our outstanding borrowings  including our senior unsecured money market line of credit and senior subordinated notes  were billion at december  compared to million at december  average borrowings in increased primarily due to our e 
texas acquisition 
for the year ended december   million of interest cost was capitalized 
dry hole  abandonment  impairment and exploration in we had dry hole  abandonment and impairment charges of million 
we recorded million for technical difficulties that were encountered on five wells in piceance before reaching total depth 
these holes were abandoned in favor of drilling to the same bottom hole location by drilling new wells 
we incurred exploration costs of million in compared to million in 
these costs consist primarily of geological and geophysical costs 
due to the release of our rigs we performed an impairment test which resulted in million of impairment costs resulting from the impairment of one rig 
additionally  we performed an impairment test of our oil and gas assets at december  and determined that no impairment was necessary 
in we had dry hole  abandonment  impairment and exploration charges of million consisting primarily of a million impairment of our coyote flats prospect to reflect its fair value in conjunction with the preparation of our year end reserve estimates  a million write down of our bakken properties sold in september  and other dry hole charges of million 
bad debt expense 
in december  flying j  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary big west oil and its wholly owned subsidiary bwoc filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
of the million recorded in bad debt expense for the year ended december   million relates to the allowance for bad debt taken for the bankruptcy of bwoc with the remainder due to the bankruptcy of semcrude earlier in hedging 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the financial statements 

table of contents estimated oil and gas operating  g a and interest expenses 
we estimate our production volume will range between  boe d and  boe d 
based on wti of and nymex hh of mmbtu  we expect our expenses to be within the following ranges amount per boe anticipated range in operating costs oil and gas production production taxes dd a g a interest expense total we expect operating costs to increase in as compared to due to higher natural gas prices which are the primary driver of our cost to generate steam in california  offset in part by our overall cost reduction efforts 
we expect production taxes will be higher on a per boe basis as our average realized price increases due to higher commodity prices and a majority of these costs are based on a percentage of our revenue 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
our exploration  development  and acquisition activities require us to make significant operating and capital expenditures 
historically  we have used cash flow from operations and our bank credit facilities as our primary sources of liquidity 
we have also used the private and public markets as other sources of financing and  as market conditions have permitted  we have engaged in asset monetization transactions 
changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact our level of cash flow generated from operations 
we employ a hedging strategy in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of wide fluctuations in the commodity prices on our cash flow 
as of december  we have approximately and of our expected and oil production hedged in the form of swaps and collars and we have approximately and of our and expected natural gas production hedged in the form of swaps and collars 
this level of hedging will provide a measure of certainty of the cash flow that we will receive for a portion of our production in and in the future  we may determine to increase or decrease our hedging positions 
most of our derivatives counterparties were commercial banks that are parties to our credit facilities  or their affiliates 
see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk below for further details concerning our hedging activities 
we have a billion senior secured revolving credit facility with a current borrowing base of million and million of available borrowing capacity 
at december   we had million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
our borrowing base is subject to semi annual redeterminations in april and october of each year 
the borrowing base is determined by the lenders a syndicate of banks  taking into consideration the estimated value of our proved oil and gas reserves based on pricing models determined by the lenders 
in may  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due and in august we issued an additional million principal amount of our senior notes due see note to the financial statements for more information regarding our senior secured revolving credit facility  our senior notes due and our senior subordinated notes due in january  we completed the sale of million shares of class a common stock at a public offering at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of million will be used to fund the wolfberry acquisition and for general corporate purposes 
pending application of the proceeds for such purposes  we reduced outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
subsequent to these transactions the amount available under our credit facility will be approximately million 
our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets on economical terms is affected by general economic conditions  the financial markets  the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies  our operational and financial performance  the value and performance of equity and debt securities  prevailing commodity prices  and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
we have also engaged in asset dispositions to generate additional cash to fund expenditures and further enhance our financial flexibility 
in april  we sold our dj basin assets and related hedges for million before customary closing adjustments and in july  we completed the sale of our e 
texas gas gathering system for million in cash 

table of contents historical cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily affected by the price of crude oil and natural gas  production volumes  and changes in working capital 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of million in compared to is primarily due to lower realized commodity sales prices in compared to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of million in compared to is primarily due to higher realized commodity sales prices and higher production volumes in compared to cash flows used by investing activities are primarily comprised of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties net of dispositions of oil and gas properties 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities of billion in compared to is due to the e 
texas acquisition  a decrease in development expenditures in and the sale of our dj basin assets and related hedges 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities of million in compared to is due to the e 
texas acquisition and an increase in development expenditures in compared to net cash used in financing activities in included the repayment of the senior secured revolving credit facility and the money market line of credit of million  debt issuance costs of million and dividends paid of million  offset by the issuance of million of senior notes due for net proceeds of million and proceeds from the sale of our e 
texas gathering system of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in included net borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility and money market line of credit of million  offset by dividends paid of million and debt issuance costs of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in included net borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility and money market line of credit of million  offset by dividends paid of million 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures for totaled million for development and were fully funded from our million operating cash flow 
we also funded million in acquisitions through borrowing on our senior secured credit facility and capitalized million of interest 
this compares to our total capital expenditures for of million for development  which were fully funded from our million operating cash flow 
we also funded million in acquisitions in through additional borrowing on our senior secured credit facility and capitalized million of interest 
excluding the acquisition of new properties  for we have established a commodity sensitive capital program that will range between million and million  which we expect to fund fully out of operating cash flow 
we expect our capital program will allow us to increase production from levels to average production between  boe d and  boe d 
we believe that our cash flow provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditures budget and our short term contractual operations during however  if our revenue and cash flow decrease in the future as a result of further deterioration in economic conditions or an adverse change in commodity prices  we may have to reduce our spending levels 
as we have operational control of all of our assets and we have limited drilling commitments  we believe that we have the financial flexibility to adjust our spending levels  if necessary  to meet our financial obligations 
contractual obligations 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in millions total thereafter long term debt and interest abandonment obligations operating lease obligations drilling and rig obligations firm natural gas transportation contracts total long term debt and interest borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility and related interest may be paid before the facility s maturity date without significant penalty 
our senior subordinated notes and related interest mature in november  but are not redeemable until november  and are not redeemable without any premium until november  
table of contents operating leases we lease corporate and field offices in california  colorado and texas 
rent expense with respect to our lease commitments for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
in  we purchased an airplane for business travel which was subsequently sold and contracted under a ten year operating lease beginning december drilling obligations we amended and restated our utah lake canyon project in december and have a gross well drilling commitment over the amended term december to december 
our minimum obligation under our exploration and development agreement is million as of december  also included in the table above are contractual obligations on our piceance assets in colorado 
we must spud wells by february to avoid penalties of million per well 
we expect to meet all obligations but our ability to meet this commitment depends on the capital resources available to us to fund our activities to develop these assets on the schedule required to avoid penalties or loss of related leases 
drilling rig obligations we are obligated in operating lease agreements for the use of four drilling rigs  one in california  one in utah  one in the piceance basin and one in e 
texas 
firm natural gas transportation we have one firm transportation contract which provides us additional flexibility in securing our natural gas supply for california operations 
this allows us to potentially benefit from lower natural gas prices in the rocky mountains compared to natural gas prices in california 
we have eight long term transportation contracts on five different pipelines to provide us with physical access to move gas from our producing areas to various markets 
other obligations we are a party to a crude oil sales contract through june  with a refiner for the purchase of a minimum of  bbl d of our uinta light crude oil 
pricing under the contract  which includes transportation and gravity adjustments  is at a fixed percentage of wti 
while the contractual differentials under this contract may be less favorable at times than the posted differential  demand for the company s degree black wax light crude oil can vary seasonally and this contract provides a stable outlet for the company s crude oil 
gross oil production from our uinta properties averaged approximately  bbl d in please see item a 
risk factors we may not be able to deliver minimum crude oil volumes required by our sales contract 
in addition  berry has signed two precedent agreements with el paso corporation for an average of  mmbtu d of firm transportation on the proposed ruby pipeline from opal  wyoming to malin  oregon 
while it is not certain that this new line will be constructed  the expectation is that the project will proceed and be in service by a component of these agreements is currently in dispute and may result in a termination of our contracts for capacity on this pipeline in which case we will make alternative arrangements for the transportation and marketing of our production 
we do not believe the termination of these contracts will result in monetary damages 
please see item a 
risk factors if third party pipelines interconnected to our natural gas wells and gathering facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport our natural gas  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as of december   the company had a gross liability for uncertain tax benefits of million and an additional million of interest related to its uncertain tax positions 
at this time  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note to our financial statements 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
successful efforts method of accounting 
we account for our oil and gas exploration and development costs using the successful efforts method 
geological and geophysical costs  and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties  are expensed as incurred 
exploratory well costs are capitalized pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found 
if economically recoverable reserves are not found  exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes 
all exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion 
exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves that are in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin  and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area  remain capitalized as long as the additional exploratory work is under way or firmly planned 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management s judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes 
once a well is drilled  the determination that economic proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and judgment 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management s judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties 

table of contents oil and gas reserves 
oil and gas reserves include proved reserves  which are those quantities of oil and natural gas which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain 
our oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent engineering consultants 
reserve engineering is a process that requires judgment in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
projected future production rates  the timing of future capital expenditures as well as changes in commodity prices  may significantly impact estimated reserve quantities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves  which estimates incorporate various assumptions and future projections 
these estimates are subject to change as additional information and technologies become available 
accordingly  oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different than projected 
reduction in reserve estimates may result in increased dd a expense 
changes in reserve estimates are applied on a prospective basis 
such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher costs fields 
we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
downward revisions in our estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates or depressed crude oil or natural gas prices could cause us to reduce the carrying amounts of our properties 
we perform an impairment analysis of our proved properties annually  or when current events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable  by comparing the future undiscounted net revenue to the net book carrying value of the assets 
an analysis of the proved properties will also be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable from future net revenue 
assets are grouped at the field level and  if it is determined that the net book carrying value cannot be recovered by the estimated future undiscounted cash flow  they are written down to fair value 
cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on our estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves  future crude oil and natural gas prices and costs to extract these reserves 
for our unproved properties  we perform an impairment analysis annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s net book carrying value may not be recoverable 
these evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future sales prices  costs to produce these products  estimates of oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing of development 
derivatives and hedging 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we also enter into derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge 
changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  to the extent the hedge is effective  have no effect on the statement of income because changes in fair value of the derivative offsets changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
where hedge accounting is not elected or if a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly based on total changes in the derivative s fair value and any ineffective portion of the derivative instrument s change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings 
the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments requires substantial judgment 
these values are based upon  among other things  whether or not the forecasted hedged transaction will occur  option pricing models  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements changes as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
effective january   we have elected to de designate all of our commodity and interest rate contracts that had previously been designated as cash flow hedges as of december  and have elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl consisted of million million after tax of unrealized losses  representing the mark to market value of the company s cash flow hedges as of the balance sheet date  less any ineffectiveness recognized 
as a result of discontinuing hedge accounting on january   such mark to market values at december  are frozen in aocl as of the de designation date and will be reclassified into earnings in future periods as the original hedged transactions affect earnings 
the company expects to reclassify into earnings from aocl the frozen value related to de designated commodity hedges during the next three years 

table of contents income taxes and uncertain tax positions 
income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consists of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax rates to the differences between financial statements and income tax reporting 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is determined that deferred tax assets may not be fully utilized in future periods 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
there can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require us to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in a future period 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
we recognize certain tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
asset retirement obligations 
our asset retirement obligations aros consist primarily of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells  removal of equipment facilities from leased acreage  and land restoration in accordance with applicable local  state and federal laws 
the discounted fair value of an aro liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of the aro requires that management make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capital cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a over the life of the oil and gas field 
environmental remediation liability 
we review  on a quarterly basis  our estimates of costs of the cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party 
when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is an estimation process that includes the judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers  and the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators or courts of law 
our experience and the experience of other companies in dealing with similar matters influence the decision of management as to how it intends to respond to a particular matter 
a change in estimate could impact our oil and gas operating costs and the liability  if applicable  recorded on our balance sheet 
accounting for business combinations 
the accounting for business combinations is complex and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the acquisition method of accounting  assets and liabilities of an acquired business are recognized at fair value 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired may not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and the present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
electricity cost allocation 
our investment in our cogeneration facilities has been for the express purpose of lowering steam costs in our california heavy oil operations and securing operating control of the respective steam generation 
such cogeneration operations produce electricity and steam and use natural gas as fuel 
we allocate steam costs to our oil and gas operating costs based on the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity and steam of the cogeneration facilities plus certain direct costs in producing steam 
electricity revenue represents sales to the utilities 
electricity used in oil and gas operations is allocated at cost 
a portion of the capital costs of the cogeneration facilities is allocated to dd a oil and gas production 
recent accounting standards updates 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the asu amends previously issued authoritative guidance and requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosures and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the rollforward activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
as this requires only additional disclosures  the guidance will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in note to the financial statements  to minimize the effect of a downturn in oil and gas prices and protect our profitability and the economics of our development plans  we enter into crude oil and natural gas hedge contracts from time to time 
the terms of contracts depend on various factors  including management s view of future crude oil and natural gas prices  acquisition economics on purchased assets and our future financial commitments 
this price hedging program is designed to moderate the effects of a severe crude oil and natural gas price downturn while allowing us to participate in some commodity price increases 
in california  we benefit from lower natural gas pricing  as we are a consumer of natural gas in our operations  and elsewhere we benefit from higher natural gas pricing 
we have hedged  and may hedge in the future  both natural gas purchases and sales as determined appropriate by management 
management regularly monitors the crude oil and natural gas markets and our financial commitments to determine if  when  and at what level some form of crude oil and or natural gas hedging and or basis adjustments or other price protection is appropriate and in accordance with policy established by our board of directors 
currently  our hedges are in the form of swaps and collars 
however  we may use a variety of hedge instruments in the future to hedge wti or the index gas price 
the collar strike prices allow us to protect our cash flow if oil prices decline below our floor prices which range from to per barrel while still participating in any oil price increase up to the ceiling prices which range from to per barrel on the volumes indicated below 
in total  we have approximately and of our expected and oil production  respectively  hedged in the form of swaps and collars 
our natural gas collars have a floor of from to per mmbtu and ceilings ranging from to per mmbtu 
in total  we have approximately and of our and expected natural gas production  respectively  hedged in the form of swaps and collars 
a ten dollar change in oil prices impacts our annual operating cash flow by approximately million 
a one dollar change in natural gas prices impacts annual operating cash flow by approximately million

table of contents we generally utilize nymex wti based derivatives to hedge cash flows from our california oil sales 
our oil sales contracts with multiple refiners are primarily based on the field posting prices 
there is a high correlation between wti and the field posting prices which have historically allowed us to utilize hedge accounting 
as there is a ready market for our crude oil in california  we do not believe the loss of any particular refiner impacts the probability that our hedged forecasted transactions will occur 
we generally hedge our natural gas at the basis location that corresponds to the sale 
while we have historically designated the majority of our hedges as cash flow hedges  we have not elected hedge accounting on certain of our crude oil and natural gas hedges 
during the twelve months ended december   we recorded a gain of million under the caption gain loss on derivatives related to hedges for which we either did not elect hedge accounting or which no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
in conjunction with the sale of the dj basin assets  during the first quarter of  we concluded that the forecasted transaction in certain of our hedging relationships was not probable of occurring 
as such  we reclassified a gain of million from aocl to the statement of income under the caption gain loss on derivative 
gain loss on derivatives included a loss for cash settlements of million and a gain for the change in fair value of million on hedges for which we have not elected hedge accounting 
additionally  a portion of the change in fair value for hedges that we have designated as cash flow hedges may impact our income as our sales price is not perfectly correlated with our hedges 
we recognized an unrealized net loss of million on the statement of income under the caption gain loss on derivatives for the twelve months ended december   as a result of ineffectiveness 
during the first quarter of  we entered into natural gas derivatives on behalf of the purchaser of our dj assets 
we did not elect hedge accounting for these hedges and recorded an unrealized net loss of million on the statement of income under the caption loss income from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
we have entered into interest rate hedges as shown below to swap the floating rate under our senior secured credit facility libor for a fixed interest rate 
these interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
notional amount hedge term mm fixed rate the related cash flow impact of all of our hedges is reflected in cash flows from operating activities 
at december   our net fair value of derivative liability was million as compared to a net fair value asset of million at december  which reflects increases in commodity prices 
based on nymex strip pricing as of december   we expect to pay cash under the existing derivatives of million during the next twelve months 
at december   aocl consisted of million  net of tax  of unrealized losses from our crude oil and natural gas swaps and collars that qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
deferred net losses recorded in aocl at december  and subsequent mark to market changes in the underlying hedging contracts are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted transaction impacts earnings

table of contents interest rates 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from long term debt 
in october  we issued  in a public offering  million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due in may  we issued  in a public offering  million of senior notes due in august  we issued  in a public offering  an additional million of senior notes due at december   total long term debt outstanding was billion 
interest on amounts borrowed under our credit facility is charged at libor plus to plus the credit facility s margin through july  based on december  credit facility borrowings  a change in interest rates  including our interest rate hedges  would have an annualized million after tax impact on our financial statements 
in june and july we entered into five year interest rate swaps for a fixed rate of approximately on million of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
these interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
in  million of these interest rate swaps were extended one year  resulting in a fixed rate of approximately 
in we also entered into three year interest rate swaps for a fixed rate of approximately on an additional million of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility for three years beginning on april and september  these interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of december   we had a total of million of fixed rate positions averaging resulting from the million of senior subordinated notes and million of interest rate swaps for a fixed rate of approximately 
during  we entered into three year interest rates swaps for a fixed rate of approximately on an additional million of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility beginning on april and december  these interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as a result of these hedge contracts  we have a total of million of fixed rate positions averaging 
effective january   we have elected to de designate all of our commodity and interest rate contracts that had previously been designated as cash flow hedges as of december  and have elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
at december   aocl consisted of million million after tax of unrealized losses  representing the mark to market value of the company s cash flow hedges as of the balance sheet date  less any ineffectiveness recognized 
as a result of discontinuing hedge accounting on january   such mark to market values at december  are frozen in aocl as of the de designation date and will be reclassified into earnings in future periods as the original hedged transactions affect earnings 
the company expects to reclassify into earnings from aocl the frozen value related to de designated commodity hedges during the next three years
