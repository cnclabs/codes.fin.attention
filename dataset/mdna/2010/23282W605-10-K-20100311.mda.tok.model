item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics that modulate muscle function for the potential treatment of serious diseases and medical conditions 
our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton  a complex biological infrastructure that plays a 
table of contents fundamental role within every human cell 
our current research and development programs relating to the biology of muscle function are directed to small molecule modulators of the contractility of cardiac  skeletal and smooth muscle 
we intend to leverage our experience in muscle contractility in order to expand our current pipeline into new therapeutic areas  and expect to continue to be able to identify additional potential drug candidates that may be suitable for clinical development 
our cardiac muscle contractility program is focused on activators of cardiac muscle myosin  a motor protein that powers cardiac muscle contraction 
our lead drug candidate from this program is omecamtiv mecarbil formerly known as ck 
we have conducted a clinical development program for omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure  comprised of a series of phase i and phase iia clinical trials 
in may  amgen acquired an exclusive license to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil worldwide  except japan  subject to our development and commercialization participation rights 
amgen is now responsible for the clinical development of omecamtiv mecarbil 
ck is the lead drug candidate from our skeletal sarcomere activator program 
the skeletal muscle sarcomere is the basic unit of skeletal muscle contraction 
we believe ck may be useful in treating diseases or medical conditions associated with skeletal muscle weakness or wasting 
ck has been studied in two phase i clinical trials and we plan to initiate at least two phase iia clinical trials of ck in in march  ck received an orphan drug designation from the fda for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
we have also designated a second  structurally distinct  fast skeletal muscle sarcomere activator for development as a backup compound to ck in our smooth muscle contractility program  we are conducting non clinical development of compounds that directly inhibit smooth muscle myosin  the motor protein central to the contraction of smooth muscle  causing the relaxation of contracted smooth muscle 
compounds from this program may be developed as a potential treatment for diseases associated with bronchoconstriction  vascular constriction  or both 
earlier research activities at the company were directed to the inhibition of mitotic kinesins  a family of cytoskeletal motor proteins involved in the process of cell division  or mitosis 
this research produced three drug candidates that have progressed into clinical testing for the potential treatment of cancer ispinesib  sb and gsk in december  we announced that we and glaxosmithkline gsk had agreed to terminate our strategic alliance  established in  relating to our mitotic kinesin inhibitors 
we are currently evaluating strategic alternatives for our oncology program with third parties 
muscle contractility programs cardiac muscle contractility program our lead drug candidate from this program is omecamtiv mecarbil  a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with amgen inc to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac muscle contractility for potential applications in the treatment of heart failure  including omecamtiv mecarbil 
the agreement provided amgen with a non exclusive license and access to certain technology 
the agreement also granted amgen an option to obtain an exclusive license worldwide  except japan  to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and other drug candidates arising from the collaboration 
in may  amgen exercised this option and subsequently paid us an exercise fee of million 
as a result  amgen is now responsible for the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds  at its expense worldwide  except japan  subject to our development and commercialization participation rights 
under the agreement  amgen will reimburse us for agreed research and development activities we perform 
the agreement provides for potential pre commercialization and commercialization milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate on omecamtiv mecarbil and other potential products arising from research under the collaboration  and royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement 
the agreement also provides for us to receive increased royalties by co funding phase iii development costs of drug candidates under the collaboration 
if we elect to co fund such costs  we would be entitled to co promote omecamtiv mecarbil in north america and participate in agreed commercialization activities in institutional care settings  at amgen s expense 

table of contents we have conducted a clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil comprised of multiple phase i and phase iia clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profiles of both intravenous and oral formulations in a diversity of patients  including patients with stable heart failure and patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy 
in these trials  omecamtiv mecarbil exhibited generally linear  dose proportional pharmacokinetics across the dose ranges studied 
the adverse effects observed at intolerable doses in humans appeared similar to the adverse findings which occurred in preclinical safety studies at similar plasma concentrations 
these effects are believed to be related to the mechanism of action of this drug candidate which  at intolerable doses  resulted in an excessive prolongation of the systolic ejection time 
however  these effects resolved promptly with discontinuation of the infusions of omecamtiv mecarbil 
throughout  we presented final data from our phase iia clinical trial evaluating omecamtiv mecarbil administered intravenously to patients with stable heart failure 
the final results showed statistically significant increases in systolic ejection time  and in stroke volume  cardiac output  fractional shortening and ejection fraction all measures of cardiac function  that occurred across the patient population in a concentration dependent manner 
in addition  the data demonstrated statistically significant correlations between increasing omecamtiv mecarbil plasma concentrations and decreases in left ventricular end systolic volume  left ventricular end diastolic volume and heart rate 
omecamtiv mecarbil appeared to be generally well tolerated in stable heart failure patients over a range of plasma concentrations during continuous intravenous administration 
patients with reduced stroke volumes ml at baseline had generally greater pharmacodynamic responses to omecamtiv mecarbil than those in patients with greater stroke volumes at baseline  demonstrating robust pharmacodynamic activity in this more severely affected sub population of patients from the trial 
throughout  we presented data from a double blind  randomized  placebo controlled phase iia clinical trial evaluating the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil on symptom limited exercise tolerance in heart failure patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and angina 
the primary safety endpoint of this clinical trial was stopping an exercise treadmill test due to angina at a stage earlier than the shorter of two baseline exercise treadmill tests 
this endpoint occurred in one patient receiving placebo and in no patients receiving either the lower or higher of two dose levels of omecamtiv mecarbil 
in heart failure patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and angina  who theoretically could be most vulnerable to the possible deleterious consequences of systolic ejection time prolongation  treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil  at doses producing plasma concentrations previously demonstrated in other trials to increase cardiac function  did not appear to deleteriously affect a broad range of safety assessments in the setting of exercise 
two serious adverse events were reported 
both occurred in a single patient who had received intravenous omecamtiv mecarbil 
both these events were judged by the investigator to have been unrelated to treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil 
in april  we initiated a phase iia  open label  multi center  multiple dose clinical trial designed to evaluate and compare the oral pharmacokinetics of a modified release and an immediate release formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil under fed conditions in patients with stable heart failure 
we have closed enrollment in this trial and completed all patient treatment 
cytokinetics and amgen have been planning a phase ib  multi center  open label  dose escalating  sequential cohort  pharmacokinetic clinical trial of modified release and immediate release oral formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil in stable heart failure patients 
in july  we announced the discontinuation of a phase iia clinical trial evaluating an intravenous formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with stable heart failure undergoing clinically indicated coronary angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory 
this decision  made jointly by the companies  was due to the challenges of the current trial design and the constraints on enrolling eligible and consenting patients 
the companies may revisit the objectives of this trial in the context of the overall clinical development program for omecamtiv mecarbil 
amgen is now responsible for clinical development of omecamtiv mecarbil following its exercise of its option 
we expect omecamtiv mecarbil to be developed as a potential treatment across the continuum of care in heart failure both as an intravenous formulation for use in the hospital setting and as an oral formulation for use in the outpatient setting 
cytokinetics and amgen have been planning a phase ib  multi center  open label  dose escalating  sequential cohort  pharmacokinetic clinical trial of modified release and immediate release oral formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil in stable heart failure patients 
we anticipate that amgen will initiate this clinical trial in the 
table of contents first half of cytokinetics and amgen have also been planning a phase ib  multi center  open label  single dose  safety and pharmacokinetic clinical trial of a modified release oral formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with renal dysfunction 
we anticipate that amgen will initiate this clinical trial in the first half of both of these clinical trials will be conducted using active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufactured by amgen 
the clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil may proceed for several years  and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed  regulatory approval is achieved  and the drug is commercialized 
omecamtiv mecarbil is at too early a stage of development for us to predict when or if this may occur 
we funded all research and development costs associated with this program prior to amgen s option exercise in may we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
subsequent to amgen s option exercise  in we received and recognized million as revenue reimbursement from amgen  including million for the transfer of our existing inventories of omecamtiv mecarbil and related reference materials and million for full time employee equivalent fte and out of pocket expense reimbursement 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development 
our expenditures will also increase if amgen terminates development of omecamtiv mecarbil or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently or if we elect to co fund later stage development of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration and option agreement with amgen 
skeletal muscle contractility program ck is the lead potential drug candidate from this program 
in  we announced that we had selected another compound from this program as a backup development compound to ck ck and its backup development compound are structurally distinct and selective small molecule activators of the fast skeletal sarcomere 
these compounds act on fast skeletal muscle troponin 
activation of troponin increases its sensitivity to calcium  leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility 
this mechanism of action has demonstrated encouraging pharmacological activity in preclinical models 
we are evaluating the potential indications for which ck may be useful 
in march  ck received an orphan drug designation from the fda for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  also known as als or lou gehrig s disease 
in june  we initiated the first part  or part a  of a two part  phase i  first time in humans  ascending  single dose  double blind  placebo controlled clinical trial of ck this trial is designed to assess the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of this drug candidate administered orally in healthy male volunteers and to determine its maximum tolerated dose and plasma concentration 
doses of up to mg have been administered in this trial without intolerable adverse events being observed 
part b of this trial  initiated in november and completed in january  was a double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  crossover study in healthy male volunteers of single oral doses of ck that were tolerated in part a 
the doses administered to the healthy volunteers in part b produced concentration dependent  statistically significant increases versus placebo in the force developed by the tibialis anterior  the muscle evaluated in this trial 
the doses administered in part b were well tolerated  and there were no serious adverse events reported 
adverse events of dizziness and euphoric mood were categorized as mild in severity  and appeared to increase in frequency with increasing doses of ck we intend to make a more complete presentation of data from part b of this trial at an appropriate scientific forum to be determined 
in november  we initiated  and in january we completed  a phase i clinical trial designed to determine the safety and tolerability of ck after multiple oral doses to steady state in healthy male volunteers 
the trial evaluated doses that produced plasma concentrations in the range associated with the pharmacodynamic activity observed in part b of the single dose phase i study 
at steady state  both the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the ck plasma concentration versus time curve from before 
table of contents dosing until hours after dosing were generally dose proportional 
in general  systemic exposure to ck in this trial was high and inter subject variability was low 
in addition  these multiple dose regimens of ck were well tolerated  and no serious adverse events were reported 
adverse events of dizziness appeared to increase in frequency with increasing doses of ck  consistent with the incidence of dizziness observed at similar doses in part b of the single dose phase i clinical trial 
events of euphoric mood occurred on ck but not on placebo  however  they did not appear to be related to the dose level and their frequency was lower than was observed at similar dose levels in part b of the single dose phase i clinical trial 
in december  we presented non clinical data relating to ck and our skeletal muscle contractility program at the society on cachexia and wasting disorders th annual cachexia conference 
we anticipate initiating at least two phase iia clinical trials of ck in one in patients with als and one in patients with claudication 
each of these phase iia clinical trials is intended to investigate whether ck may produce evidence of pharmacodynamic effects in the respective patient population 
we anticipate continuing non clinical development studies of the backup potential drug candidate in our skeletal muscle contractility program throughout ck is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from its commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our skeletal muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our skeletal muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance ck  its back up compound or other compounds from this program into and through development 
smooth muscle contractility program smooth muscle is a non striated form of muscle that is found in the circulatory  respiratory  digestive and genitourinary organ systems and is responsible for the contractile properties of these tissues 
smooth muscle contractility is driven by smooth muscle myosin  a cytoskeletal motor protein that is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into mechanical force 
our smooth muscle contractility program is focused on the discovery and development of small molecule smooth muscle myosin inhibitors  and leverages our expertise in muscle function and its application to drug discovery 
our inhaled smooth muscle myosin inhibitors have demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models of bronchoconstriction and may have application for indications such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
our smooth muscle myosin inhibitors  administered orally or intravenously  have demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models of vascular constriction 
smooth muscle myosin inhibitors administered orally may have application in systemic hypertension 
we intend to continue to conduct non clinical development of compounds from this program 
in november  we presented three abstracts summarizing non clinical data from our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor program at the scientific sessions of the american heart association 
this potential drug candidate is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from its commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our smooth muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our smooth muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance compounds from this program into and through development 
oncology program mitotic kinesin inhibitors we currently have three drug candidates for the potential treatment of cancer ispinesib  sb and gsk all of these arose from our earlier research activities directed to the role of the cytoskeleton in cell division and were progressed under our strategic alliance with gsk 
this strategic alliance was established in to 
table of contents discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics targeting mitotic kinesins for applications in the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
mitotic kinesins are a family of cytoskeletal motor proteins involved in the process of cell division  or mitosis 
under this strategic alliance  we focused primarily on two mitotic kinesins kinesin spindle protein ksp and centromere associated protein e cenp e 
inhibition of ksp or cenp e interrupts cancer cell division  causing cell death 
ispinesib and sb are structurally distinct small molecules that specifically inhibit ksp 
gsk specifically inhibits cenp e 
in november  we amended our strategic alliance with gsk and assumed responsibility  at our expense  for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins  other than cenp e 
gsk retained an option to resume responsibility for the development and commercialization of either or both of ispinesib and sb this option expired at the end of as a result  we have retained all rights to develop and commercialize ispinesib and sb  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
in december  we agreed with gsk to terminate this strategic alliance  effective february  accordingly  we have retained all rights to develop and commercialize gsk  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
we are evaluating strategic alternatives for the future development and commercialization of ispinesib  sb and gsk with third parties 
ispinesib under our strategic alliance  gsk  in collaboration with the national cancer institute  sponsored the initial clinical trials program for ispinesib  which consisted of nine phase ii clinical trials and eight phase i or ib clinical trials evaluating ispinesib in a variety of both solid and hematologic cancers 
to date  we believe clinical activity for ispinesib has been observed in non small cell lung  ovarian and breast cancers  with the most clinical activity observed in a phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had failed treatment with taxanes and anthracyclines 
in addition  preclinical and phase ib clinical data on ispinesib indicate that it may have an additive effect when combined with certain existing chemotherapeutic agents 
as a result of the expiration of gsk s option relating to ispinesib  we have retained all development and commercialization rights to ispinesib  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
throughout  we continued to conduct the phase i portion of an open label  non randomized phase i ii clinical trial designed to evaluate ispinesib as monotherapy administered as a first line treatment in chemotherapy na ve patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
this trial was designed to be a proof of concept study to potentially amplify the previously observed signals of clinical activity in breast cancer patients by using a more dose dense schedule 
the primary objectives of the phase i portion of this clinical trial were to determine the dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose  and to assess the safety and tolerability of ispinesib administered as a hour intravenous infusion on days and of a day cycle 
in june  we presented interim data from this trial  which included tumor reductions of at least in patients 
ispinesib appeared to demonstrate anti cancer activity with a similar tolerability profile when compared with prior clinical trials conducted with a once every days dosing schedule 
we have completed patient treatment in the phase i portion of this trial and have closed the trial 
we are evaluating strategic alternatives for the future development and commercialization of ispinesib with third parties 
sb sb was studied by gsk in a dose escalating phase i clinical trial in advanced cancer patients using a once every day dosing schedule 
dose limiting toxicities in this clinical trial consisted predominantly of neutropenia and elevations in hepatic enzymes and bilirubin 
disease stabilization  ranging from to weeks  was observed in seven patients  one patient with cholangiocarcinoma had a confirmed partial response at the maximum tolerated dose 
as a result of the expiration of gsk s option relating to sb  we have retained all development and commercialization rights to sb  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
throughout  we continued to conduct the phase i portion of a phase i ii clinical trial of sb in patients with hodgkin or non hodgkin lymphoma 
the primary objectives of the phase i portion of this trial are to determine the dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose and to assess the safety and tolerability of sb administered as a hour intravenous infusion on days and of a day cycle  a more dose dense 
table of contents schedule than was previously evaluated  first without and then with the prophylactic administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf 
throughout  we presented interim data from this trial at several scientific conferences 
for sb given with g csf support  the maximum tolerated dose was mg m and the main dose limiting toxicity of sb was thrombocytopenia and neutropenia 
a greater dose density was achieved with sb given on a once every two week schedule without prophylactic g csf than a once every days schedule 
grade or toxicities other than myelosuppression were infrequent  and there was no evidence of neuropathy or alopecia greater than grade an efficacy signal was observed at doses at or above mg m in hodgkin lymphoma patients 
of the patients evaluable for efficacy  four partial responses three patients with hodgkin lymphoma and one with indolent non hodgkin lymphoma were observed 
the duration of the response in the patients with a partial response was between weeks and weeks 
the authors concluded that further evaluation of sb in selected hodgkin lymphoma populations as a single agent  and in combination with other promising drug candidates  is warranted 
we have closed enrollment in this trial and intend to complete patient treatment in the phase i portion of this trial 
we are evaluating strategic alternatives for the future development and commercialization of sb with third parties 
gsk gsk  an inhibitor of cenp e  is the third drug candidate to arise from our strategic alliance with gsk 
gsk causes partial and complete shrinkages of human tumors in animal models and has exhibited properties in these studies distinguishing it from ispinesib and sb following the agreed termination of our strategic alliance with gsk in february  we have retained all development and commercialization rights to gsk  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
under our strategic alliance  gsk was responsible  at its expense  for the development of and commercialization of gsk during  gsk continued to enroll patients and dose escalate in its phase i clinical trial of gsk the primary objective of this dose escalation and pharmacokinetic phase i clinical trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose  dose limiting toxicities  safety and pharmacokinetics of gsk in patients with advanced  refractory solid tumors 
gsk was well tolerated at doses ranging from to mg m among the patients enrolled in the trial  six received the maximum tolerated dose of mg m  and eight received a higher dose of mg m  at which dose limiting toxicity was observed in three of seven evaluable patients 
dose limiting toxicities occurred in two patients with grade fatigue and one with grade hypokalemia  a lower than normal amount of potassium in the blood 
no clear dose related effects on hematologic parameters or gastro intestinal toxicities were observed 
a decrease in the sum of tumor diameters partial response was observed in one patient with urothelial carcinoma  which was achieved after six cycles at mg m gsk exposure appeared to be dose proportional across the range of doses studied 
gsk has agreed to complete this clinical trial  at its expense 
we are evaluating strategic alternatives for the future development and commercialization of gsk with third parties 
non clinical data relating to gsk were presented at the april american association of cancer research annual meeting  the june annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology  the november aacr nci eortc international conference and the december nd annual san antonio breast cancer symposium 
each of ispinesib  sb and gsk is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from its commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with ispinesib and sb following gsk s completion of its phase i clinical trial of gsk  we will be responsible for any further research and development costs associated with gsk we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our mitotic kinesins oncology program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we received and recognized as revenue reimbursements from gsk of fte and other expenses related to our mitotic kinesins oncology program of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
following completion of the current phase i portions of the phase i ii clinical trials for each of ispinesib and sb and the current phase i clinical trial of gsk  we do not currently intend to conduct any further development of these drug candidates ourselves 
we are evaluating strategic alternatives to continue the development of ispinesib  
table of contents sb and gsk with third parties 
we may not be able to enter into an agreement regarding such an alternative on acceptable terms  if at all 
development risks the successful development of any of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing and costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development activities due to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to decisions made by amgen with respect to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil  the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical trials  the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after these trials have been initiated and completed  our potential inability to obtain additional funding and resources for our development activities on acceptable terms  if at all  including  but not limited to  our potential inability to obtain or retain partners to assist in the design  management  conduct and funding of clinical trials  delays or additional costs in manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical trial use  including developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates  the uncertainty of clinical trial results  including variability in patient response  the uncertainty of obtaining fda or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of our drug candidates  the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility  and possible delays in the characterization  formulation and manufacture of potential drug candidates 
if we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us or our partners to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled we have never generated  and may never generate  revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years  if ever  clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval and clinical trials are expensive  time consuming and subject to delay  and other risk factors 
revenues our current revenue sources are limited  and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for several years  if at all 
we have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with amgen and gsk for license fees and agreed research activities 
in december  we entered into our collaboration and option agreement with amgen  under which we received an upfront  non refundable  non exclusive license and technology access fee of million 
in connection with entering into the agreement  we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement with amgen 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock to amgen for net proceeds of million  of which the million purchase premium was recorded as deferred revenue 
through may  we amortized the upfront non exclusive license and technology access fee and stock purchase premium to license revenue ratably over the maximum term of the non exclusive license  which was four years 
in june  we 
table of contents recognized as revenue the remaining balance of million of the related deferred revenue when amgen exercised its option  triggering the end of the non exclusive license period 
in june  we received a non refundable option exercise fee from amgen of million  which we recognized in revenue as license fees from a related party 
we may receive additional payments from amgen upon achieving certain precommercialization and commercialization milestones 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by the achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we have received reimbursements from amgen for agreed research and development activities  which we recorded as revenue as the related expenses were incurred 
we may be eligible to receive further reimbursements from amgen for agreed research and development activities  which we will record as revenue if and when the related expenses are incurred 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
revenues from gsk in were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes performing research under the strategic alliance and our out of pocket expenses  which we recorded as the related expenses were incurred 
gsk paid us an upfront licensing fee  which we recognized ratably over the strategic alliance s initial five year research term  which ended in june in  we received a million milestone payment from gsk relating to its initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
the revenues recognized to date are non refundable  even if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in december  gsk s option to license ispinesib and sb expired and all rights to these drug candidates remain with us under the collaboration and license agreement  subject to our royalty obligations to gsk 
in december  we agreed with gsk to terminate this strategic alliance  effective february  accordingly  we have retained all rights to develop and commercialize gsk  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other precommercialization milestones under our strategic alliance with amgen  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year 
if one or more of our drug candidates is approved for sale as a drug  we expect that our future revenues will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to amgen under our strategic alliance and from those licensed to future partners  and from direct sales of our drugs 
we retain a product by product option to co fund certain later stage development activities under our strategic alliance with amgen  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
if we exercise our co promotion rights under this strategic alliance  we are entitled to receive reimbursement for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
research and development we incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities 
we expect to incur research and development expenses for omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with amgen 
we expect to incur research and development expenses for the continued conduct of preclinical studies and non clinical and clinical development for ck and other skeletal sarcomere activators for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting  preclinical studies and non clinical development of our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with bronchoconstriction  vascular constriction  or both  and our research programs in other disease areas 
research and development expenses related to our strategic alliance with gsk consisted primarily of costs related to research and screening  lead optimization and other activities relating to the identification of compounds for development as mitotic kinesin inhibitors for the treatment of cancer 
prior to june  certain of these costs were reimbursed by gsk on an fte basis 
from through november  gsk funded the majority of the costs related to the clinical development of ispinesib and sb in june  under our amended collaboration and license agreement with gsk  we assumed responsibility for the continued research  development and 
table of contents commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins other than cenp e  at our sole expense 
in addition  we expect to incur minimal research and development expenses for the close out of the clinical trials for ispinesib and sb and for potential translational research relating to our mitotic kinesin inhibitors 
research and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund consist primarily of employee compensation  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and contract research and manufacturing  facilities costs and depreciation of equipment 
from our inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million for research and development activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program  million for our skeletal muscle contractility program  million for our smooth muscle contractility program  million for our mitotic kinesin inhibitors program  million for our proprietary technologies and million for other research programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions  including  but not limited to  finance  human resources  legal  business and commercial development and strategic planning 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and regulatory compliance 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in restructuring in september  we announced a restructuring plan to realign our workforce and operations in line with a strategic reassessment of our research and development activities and corporate objectives 
as a result  we focused our research activities to our muscle contractility programs while continuing our then ongoing clinical trials in heart failure and cancer  and discontinued early research activities directed to oncology 
to implement this plan  we reduced our workforce at the time by approximately  or employees  to employees 
the affected employees were provided with severance and related benefits payments and outplacement assistance 
we have completed all restructuring activities and recognized all anticipated restructuring charges 
all severance payments were made as of december  as a result of the restructuring plan  in we recorded total restructuring charges of million for employee severance and benefit related costs and a million charge related to the impairment of lab equipment that was held for sale 
in  we recorded a net reduction in restructuring charges of  representing primarily the reversal of employee benefit related accruals partially offset by impairment losses on held for sale equipment 
stock compensation the following table summarizes stock based compensation related to stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases for  and  which was allocated as follows in thousands years ended december  research and development general and administrative stock based compensation included in operating expenses as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options granted under our stock plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards as of december  was million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  through  we continued to amortize deferred stock based compensation recorded for stock options granted prior to our initial public offering 
the remaining balance became fully amortized in 
table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we did not record an income tax provision in the years ended december  and because we had a net taxable loss in each of those periods 
we recorded an income tax provision of  in due to alternative minimum tax 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance  reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of december  and the valuation allowance was determined pursuant to the accounting guidance for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance decreased by million in  and increased by million and million in and  respectively 
we also follow the accounting guidance that defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
we are currently not undergoing any income tax examinations 
in general  the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for the purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and credits carried forward from those years 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million before federal benefit at december  if not utilized  the federal and state operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in various amounts beginning and  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforwards include deductions for stock options 
when utilized  the portion related to stock option deductions will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision 
we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  at december  if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where equity transactions resulted in a change of ownership as defined by internal revenue code section during the year ended december   we conducted a study and determined that our use of our federal research credit is subject to such a restriction 
accordingly  we reduced our deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance by million 
as a result  the research credit amount as of december  reflects the restriction on our ability to use the credit 
interest and penalties were zero for and we account for interest and penalties by classifying both as income tax expense in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits  net of valuation allowances necessary to reflect expectations of realizability  to change materially over the next twelve months

research and development revenues from gsk of million in consisted of a million milestone payment for gsk s initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk  and patent expense reimbursements of million 
in each of june  and  the research term of our strategic alliance with gsk was extended for an additional year under an updated research plan focused only on cenp e without corresponding fte reimbursement 
in december  gsk s option to license each of ispinesib and sb as provided under the parties collaboration and license agreement expired 
accordingly  we retain all rights to both ispinesib and sb  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
in december  we and gsk agreed to terminate the collaboration and license agreement  effective february  as a result  all rights to gsk reverted to us at that time  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
license revenues from related parties refers to license revenues from our strategic alliance with amgen 
license revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
license revenues for consisted of the million option exercise fee received from amgen in june and the recognition of deferred revenue of the remaining million related to the upfront non exclusive license and technology access fee and stock purchase premium from amgen 
license revenue of million in each of and consisted of amortization of the upfront non exclusive license and technology access fee and stock purchase premium from amgen 
deferred revenue related to the amgen collaboration and option agreement and our related common stock purchase agreement with amgen was million at december  and million at december  the deferred revenue balance at december  related to amgen s prepayment of fte reimbursements 
the deferred revenue balance at december  represented the unrecognized portion of the non exclusive license and technology access fee and stock purchase premium from research and development expenses increase years ended december  decrease in millions research and development expenses 
table of contents research and development expenses decreased million in compared to  and increased million in compared to the decrease in was primarily due to decreases in clinical and preclinical outsourcing costs of million related to our cardiac muscle contractility and mitotic kinesin inhibitors clinical trial programs and preclinical outsourcing costs  million for personnel related costs and million for laboratory and facility related costs 
the slight increase in research and development expenses  compared to  was primarily due to an increase of million related to our cardiac muscle contractility and mitotic kinesin inhibitors clinical trial programs  partially offset by decreases of million in personnel expenses and million in laboratory and facilities expenses 
from a program perspective  the decline in research and development spending in compared to was due to decreases of million for our cardiac muscle contractility program  million for our smooth muscle contractility program  million for our mitotic kinesin inhibitors program  million for our proprietary technologies and million for our other research and preclinical programs  partially offset by an increase of million for our skeletal muscle contractility program 
the increase in research and development spending in compared to was due to increases of million for our skeletal muscle contractility program and million for our mitotic kinesin inhibitors development program  million for our smooth muscle contractility program  partially offset by the decreases in spending for million for our cardiac muscle contractility program  million for our other research programs and million for proprietary technologies

pursuant to the amgen collaboration and option agreement  in we transferred to amgen for million the majority of our existing inventories of omecamtiv mecarbil and related reference materials 
our out of pocket costs for the transferred materials were incurred and recorded as research and development expense in prior periods 
fte reimbursements from amgen are at negotiated rates that approximate our costs  and which we believe approximate fair value 
we recognized revenue from gsk for the reimbursement of research and development costs related to our mitotic kinesin inhibitors of  million and million  for   and  respectively 
the revenue from gsk in and consisted of reimbursements for patent costs 
the revenue from gsk in consisted of a million milestone payment for gsk s initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk  and patent expense reimbursements of million 
we recorded the reimbursements from amgen and gsk and the gsk milestone payment as research and development revenues from related parties 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate 
we anticipate that we will determine on an on going basis which research and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program  taking into account the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by 
table of contents us to obtain and maintain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we expect our research and development expenditures to increase in for the following reasons as part of our strategic alliance with amgen  we expect to continue development of our drug candidate omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure 
we expect to continue development of our drug candidate ck for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting  and of our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds for the potential treatment of systemic hypertension and diseases and medical conditions associated with bronchoconstriction 
we also expect to continue to incur costs associated with the close out of each of the clinical trials of our drug candidates ispinesib and sb we anticipate research and development expenses for will be in the range of million to million 
non cash expenses such as stock based compensation and depreciation of approximately million are included in our estimate of research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses years ended increase december  decrease in millions general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million in compared with  and decreased million in compared with the increase in was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses of million  partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses of million 
the increase in personnel expense in was primarily due to no employee bonuses being paid for and a special bonus totaling million being paid to all employees in july in recognition of our employees contributions which resulted both in amgen exercising its option for an exclusive license to omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds and in our closing of the registered direct equity offering in  partially offset by decreases in salaries and stock based compensation 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in  compared to  was primarily due to decreases of million in personnel expenses and million in legal expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in for  we anticipate general and administrative expenses to be in the range of million to million

table of contents auction rate securities ars 
our short term investments at december  included at par value million of ars 
these ars were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  these ars have experienced multiple failed auctions since february  as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result  the ars are currently not liquid 
the assets underlying these ars are student loans that are substantially backed by the federal government 
as of december   our ars with par values totaling million had a credit rating of aaa  our ars with par values totaling million had a credit rating of aa  and our ars with par values totaling million had a credit rating of a all of these securities continue to pay interest according to their stated terms generally basis points over the ninety one day us treasury bill rate with interest rates resetting every days 
these ars are scheduled to ultimately mature between and  although we do not intend to hold them until maturity 
we intend to liquidate the ars on june   the earliest date we can exercise the ars rights 
the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
the fair values of these ars as of december  were estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums and expected holding periods of the ars  based on data available 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  which could result in significant changes to the fair value of the ars 
the significant assumptions of this discounted cash flow model are discount margins which are based on industry recognized student loan sector indices  an additional liquidity discount and an estimated term to liquidity 
other items this analysis considers are the collateralization underlying the ars  the creditworthiness of the counterparty and the timing of expected future cash flows 
these ars were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics as the securities held by us 
the fair value of our ars as of december  and december  was determined to be million and million  respectively 
changes in the fair value of the ars are recognized in current period earnings in interest and other  net 
accordingly  we recognized million of unrealized gain in in connection with the failed auctions of our ars  which were marketed and sold by ubs ag and its affiliates  in october  we accepted a settlement with ubs ag pursuant to which ubs ag issued to us the ars rights 
the ars rights provide us the right to receive the par value of our ars  ie  the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid interest 
pursuant to the ars rights  we may require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time between june  and july  we intend to liquidate the ars on june  in addition  ubs or its affiliates may sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of the ars at its discretion at any time prior to expiration of the ars rights  subject to the obligation to pay us the par value of such ars 
the ars rights are not transferable  tradable or marginable  and will not be listed or quoted on any securities exchange or any electronic communications network 
as consideration for ars rights  we agreed to release ubs ag  ubs securities llc and ubs financial services  inc  and or their affiliates  directors  and officers from any claims directly or indirectly relating to the marketing and sale of the ars  other than for consequential damages 
ubs s obligations in connection with the ars rights are not secured by its assets and ubs is not required to obtain any financing to support these obligations 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations in connection with the ars rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to purchase the ars and the auction process continues to fail  we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
the ars rights represent a firm agreement in accordance with accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging 
the guidance defines a firm agreement as an agreement with an unrelated party  binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable  with the following characteristics a the agreement specifies all significant terms  including the quantity to be exchanged  the fixed price and the timing of the transaction  and b the agreement includes a disincentive for nonperformance that is sufficiently large to make performance probable 
the enforceability of the ars rights results in a put option  which we recognized as a separate freestanding instrument that is accounted for separately from the ars 
as of december   we recorded million as the fair value of the investment put option related to the ars rights  classified as short term assets on the balance sheet 
the investment put option related to the ars rights does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument 
therefore  we elected to 
table of contents measure the investment put option related to the ars rights at fair value  as permitted under accounting guidance for the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities  to mitigate volatility in reported earnings due to its linkage to the ars 
we valued the investment put option related to the ars rights using a black scholes option pricing model that included estimates of interest rates  based on data available  and that was adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to purchase the ars beginning june  any change in the assumptions on which these estimates are based or market conditions would affect the fair value of the investment put option related to the ars rights 
we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the investment put option related to the ars rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related ars with no material net impact to the statements of operations  subject to changes in ubs s credit risk rating and its ultimate ability to perform 
we will continue to measure the investment put option related to the ars rights at fair value until the earlier of our exercise of the ars rights  ubs s purchase of the ars in connection with the ars rights or the maturity of the ars underlying the ars rights 
in connection with the settlement with ubs ag relating to our ars  we entered into a loan agreement with ubs bank usa and ubs financial services inc on january   we borrowed approximately million under the loan agreement  with our ars held in accounts with ubs and its affiliates as collateral 
the loan amount was based on of the fair value as assessed by ubs at the time of the loan 
we have drawn down the full amount available under the loan agreement 
in general  the amount of interest payable under the loan agreement is intended to equal the amount of interest we would otherwise receive with respect to our ars 
during  the interest rate due on the ubs loan was approximately the same as the interest rate earned from the ars 
the principal balance of the loan was lower than the par value of the ars in during  we paid  of interest expense associated with the loan and received  in interest income from the ars 
in accordance with the loan agreement  we applied the net interest received of  and proceeds from ars sales of million to the principal of the loan 
the borrowings under the loan agreement are payable upon demand 
however  ubs financial services inc or its affiliates will be required to arrange alternative financing for us on terms and conditions substantially the same as those under the loan agreement  unless the demand right was exercised as a result of certain specified events or the customer relationship between ubs and us is terminated for cause by ubs 
if such alternative financing cannot be established  then a ubs affiliate will purchase the pledged ars at par value 
proceeds of sales of the ars will first be applied to repayment of the loan with the balance  if any  for our account 
we continue to monitor the market for ars and consider its impact if any on the fair market value of our ars 
if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in earnings  offset by corresponding increases in the investment put option related to the ars rights  assuming no deterioration of ubs s credit rating 
at present  if we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we may not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal until a future auction for the ars is successful  another secondary market evolves for the ars  they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  we could be required to hold them to maturity 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments for impairment on an ongoing basis 
shelf registration statement 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  which was declared effective in november the shelf registration statement allows us to issue shares of our common stock from time to time for an aggregate initial offering price of up to million 
as of march   million remains available to us under this shelf registration statement  assuming all outstanding warrants are exercised in cash 
the specific terms of offerings  if any  under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offerings 
in august  we secured a new equipment financing credit line with ge capital of up to million  which expired september  the line of credit was subject to the terms of a master security agreement between us and ge capital  dated february and as amended on march  and related term sheet 
we did not borrow any funds under this line 

table of contents as of december   future minimum payments under our loan and lease obligations were as follows in thousands within two to four to after one year three years five years five years total operating leases equipment financing lines loan with ubs total our long term commitments under operating leases relate to payments under our two facility leases in south san francisco  california  which expire in and the loan with ubs is classified as short term because we intend to repay it on june   the earliest date we may exercise our ars rights to require ubs to purchase the ars that collateralize the loan at par value 
see note in the notes to financial statements for further details regarding the maturity date of the loan with ubs bank usa 
in future periods  we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to expand our research programs and related research and development activities 
we plan to continue to support the clinical development of our cardiac muscle myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure as part of our strategic alliance with amgen 
we plan to continue clinical development of our fast skeletal sarcomere activator ck for the potential treatment of diseases and conditions related to muscle weakness or wasting and non clinical development of our back up potential drug candidate from our skeletal sarcomere activator program 
we plan to progress one or more of our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds through non clinical and clinical development 
we expect to incur development expenses for the close out of the clinical trials for ispinesib for the potential treatment of breast cancer and sb for the potential treatment of hodgkin and non hodgkin lymphoma 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of our other muscle contractility programs through research to candidate selection 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the initiation  progress  timing  scope and completion of preclinical research  non clinical development and clinical trials for our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies  amgen s decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds for the potential treatment of heart failure under our collaboration  our level of funding for the development of current or future drug candidates  the number of drug candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our ability to establish and maintain selected strategic alliances required for the development of drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs  our plans or ability to expand our drug development capabilities  including our capabilities to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates  our plans or ability to establish sales  marketing or manufacturing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs  the expansion and advancement of our research programs  
table of contents the hiring of additional employees and consultants  the expansion of our facilities  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  interest earned on investments  proceeds from our loan with ubs bank usa  and proceeds already received from our equity financings will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
if  at any time  our prospects for internally financing our research and development programs decline  we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying  discontinuing or reducing our funding of development of one or more of our drug candidates or potential drug candidates or of other research and development programs 
alternatively  we might raise funds through strategic alliances  public or private financings or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms  or at all 
furthermore  financing obtained through future strategic alliances may require us to forego certain commercialization and other rights to our drug candidates 
similarly  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
investments available for sale and trading investments 
our investments consist of ars  municipal and government agency bonds  commercial paper  us government treasury securities  and money market funds 
we designated all investments  except for our ars held by ubs  as available for sale 
therefore  they are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reclassified our ars held by ubs from available for sale to trading securities 
investments that we designate as trading assets are reported at fair value  with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
see notes to financial statements note cash equivalents  investments and fair value measurements for further detailed discussion 
investments with original maturities greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 

table of contents investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
in addition  we classify investments as short term or long term based upon whether such assets are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during our normal business operating cycle 
other than temporary impairment 
all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments below the cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
factors considered by management in assessing whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred include the nature of the investment  whether the decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting the investment  the financial condition of the investee  the severity and the duration of the impairment  and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
when we determine that an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the investment is written down to its market value at the end of the period in which we determine that an other than temporary decline had occurred 
the amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are included in other income or expense 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest and other  net 
the par value of our investments in ars totaled million at december  and million at december  we determined that no impairment of our investments existed at december  due to the resetting variable rates of the ars  their fair value generally approximated cost until february there were no realized gains or losses from our ars during the years ended december   or there were no failed auctions on any of our ars through december  and we deemed that no impairment existed as of that date 
the unrealized loss on the ars was zero at december  at december   we classified million of our ars as long term due to the uncertainty as to whether such securities will be available for current operations 
at december  and december   we classified our ars as short term and long term trading securities  respectively  for which unrealized gains and losses are recorded in current period earnings 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for research performed and milestones met  and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
research and development revenues  which are earned under agreements with third parties for agreed research and development activities  may include non refundable license fees  research and development funding  cost reimbursements and contingent milestones and royalties 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue as we perform under the applicable agreement 
where the level of effort is relatively consistent over the performance period  we recognize total fixed or determined revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of expected performance 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  provided the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort and risk is involved in achieving the milestone and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if these conditions are not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 

table of contents research and development revenues and cost reimbursements are based upon negotiated rates for our ftes and actual out of pocket costs 
fte rates are negotiated rates that are based upon our costs  and which we believe approximate fair value 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
none of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in revenue arrangements in which both parties make payments to each other  we evaluate the payments to determine whether payments made by us will be recognized as a reduction of revenue or as expense 
revenue we recognize may be reduced by payments made to the other party under the arrangement unless we receive a separate and identifiable benefit in exchange for the payments and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed utilizing third party contract research organizations cros and other vendors 
for preclinical studies  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the percentage of work completed to date and contract milestones achieved 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  duration of enrollment and percentage of work completed to date 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and status meetings with cros and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by our cros and other vendors 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate data  we may under or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies or clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity levels become known 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
stock based compensation we apply the accounting guidance for stock compensation  which establishes the accounting for share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
under this guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award 
under the guidance for stock compensation for non employees  we measure the fair value of the award each period until the award is fully vested 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates at the time  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if conditions change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we did not record an income tax provision in the years ended december  and because we had a net taxable loss in each of those periods 
we recorded an income tax provision of  in due to alternative minimum tax 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance  reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we maintained a full 
table of contents valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of december  and the valuation allowance was determined pursuant to the accounting guidance for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance decreased by million in  and increased by million and million in and  respectively 
we also follow the accounting guidance that defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
we are currently not undergoing any income tax examinations 
in general  the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for the purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and credits carried forward from those years 
interest and penalties were zero for and we account for interest and penalties by classifying both as income tax expense in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits  net of valuation allowances necessary to reflect expectations of realizability  to change materially over the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements we adopted the new accounting guidance for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and for identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the new guidance provides additional direction for determining fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs represent distressed sales 
the new guidance reaffirms existing guidance that fair value is the amount for which an asset would be sold in an orderly transaction as opposed to a forced liquidation or distressed sale under current market conditions at the date of the financial statements 
the new guidance amends the disclosure provisions of existing guidance to require entities to disclose the valuation inputs and techniques in interim and annual financial statements  and to disclose fair value hierarchies and the level reconciliation by major security types 
our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we adopted the new accounting guidance on interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments 
the new guidance amends the existing guidance to require public companies to provide disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual financial statements 
our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we adopted the new accounting guidance for recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
the new guidance provides additional direction for determining the credit and non credit components of other than temporary impairments of debt securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity 
the guidance also increases and clarifies existing disclosure requirements and extends the disclosure frequency to interim and annual periods 
our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we adopted the new accounting guidance for subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it provides guidance regarding the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we adopted the financial accounting standard board s fasb new guidance on the hierarchy and sources of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the new guidance 
table of contents identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap in the united states 
the guidance establishes the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the issuance of the codification did not change gaap 
our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  all references to gaap literature in our historical filings are superseded by references to the codification 
we adopted the new accounting guidance for measuring liabilities at fair value 
the new guidance amends existing guidance to provide clarification on how to measure the fair value of a liability in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
it also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  an entity is not required to include or adjust an input relating to a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
the new guidance also clarifies that the quoted price for an identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market may be used as a level fair value measurement for a liability 
our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for recognizing revenue for a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement 
the new guidance amends the existing guidance for separately accounting for individual deliverables in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables  and removes the criterion that an entity must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value to separately account for the deliverables 
the new guidance also establishes a hierarchy for determining the value of each deliverable and establishes the relative selling price method for allocating consideration when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of value does not exist 
we must adopt the new guidance prospectively for new revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning in the first quarter of earlier adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our financial statements and the timing of its adoption 
in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new guidance requires a gross presentation of level fair value rollforwards and adds a new requirement to disclose transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements 
the new guidance also clarifies existing guidance about the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques 
the new guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  except for the gross presentation of level rollforwards  which is effective for the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of the new fair value guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest a portion of our excess cash in us treasuries and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure in any one issuer and investment class 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by attempting to limit default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including us government and agency securities  high grade municipal and us bonds and money market funds 
our investment portfolio of short term investments is subject to interest rate risk  and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
at december   we held approximately million of ars classified as short term investments  whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed 
consequently  the ars are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of the ars is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  they are redeemed by the issuers or the ars mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our ars and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
as of december   our ars with par values totaling million had a credit rating of aaa  our ars with par values totaling million had a credit rating of aa  and our ars with par values totaling million had a credit rating of a at december   our investment advisors provided a valuation for the ars utilizing a discounted cash flow approach to arrive at the valuation of our ars  which was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis we prepared 
based on this level valuation defined by fair value accounting guidance  we valued the ars at million  which represents a decline in value of million from par 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  thereby could result in significant changes to the fair value of our ars 
in connection with the failed auctions of our ars  which were marketed and sold by ubs ag and its affiliates  in october  we accepted a settlement with ubs ag pursuant to which ubs ag has issued to us the ars rights 
the ars rights provide us the right to receive the par value of our ars  ie  the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid interest 
pursuant to the ars rights  we may require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time between june  and july  in addition  ubs or its affiliates may sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of the ars at its discretion at any time prior to expiration of the ars rights  subject to the obligation to pay us the par value of such ars 
the ars rights are not transferable  tradable or marginable  and will not be listed or quoted on any securities exchange or any electronic communications network 
as consideration for ars rights  we agreed to release ubs ag  ubs securities llc and ubs financial services  inc  and or their affiliates  directors  and officers from any claims directly or indirectly relating to the marketing and sale of the ars  other than for consequential damages 
ubs s obligations in connection with the ars rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support these obligations 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations in connection with the ars rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to purchase the ars and the auction process continues to fail  we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
we valued the put option using a black scholes option pricing model that included estimates of interest rates  based on data available as of december   and was adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  any change in these assumptions and market conditions would affect the value of the ars rights 
a decline in fair value of the ars would be largely offset by an increase in fair value of the ars rights 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded our ars as investments available for sale 
we recorded unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale debt securities  in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet 
such an unrealized loss did not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period 
simultaneously  due to the ars rights granted by ubs  we made a one time election to transfer the related ars holdings from available for sale securities to trading securities 
as a result of this transfer  we recognized an other than temporary loss of approximately million  and reversed the related temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded in other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
we also recorded the investment put option related to the ars rights in accordance with the fair value option permitted under fair value accounting guidance for financial instruments 
we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the investment put option related to the ars rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related ars with no material net impact to the statement of operations  subject to ubs s continued expected 
table of contents performance of its obligations in connection with the ars rights 
the investment put option related to the ars rights will continue to be measured at fair value under the fair value option permitted under fair value accounting guidance for financial instruments  until the earlier of our exercise of the ars rights  ubs s purchase of the ars in connection with the ars rights  or the maturity of the ars underlying the ars rights 
see note in the notes to financial statements for further details regarding our ars and ars rights 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
consequently  we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant interest rate risk and have therefore excluded them from the table below 
on the liability side  our equipment financing lines carry fixed interest rates and therefore also may be subject to changes in fair value if market interest rates fluctuate 
we do not have any foreign currency or derivative financial instruments 
the interest payments associated with our loan with ubs are based on variable rates and are offset by the interest income earned on the ars that collateralize the loan 
none of the exercise of the ars rights  ubs s purchase of the ars in connection with the ars rights  or the maturity of the ars underlying the ars rights poses significant interest rate risk 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our equipment financing lines and investment portfolio  except ars dollars in thousands fair value at december  beyond total assets short term investments average interest rate liabilities equipment financing lines average interest rate
