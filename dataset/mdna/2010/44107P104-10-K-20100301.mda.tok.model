item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview as of february   we own luxury and upper upscale hotel properties and we are the largest lodging reit in the national association of real estate investment trust s composite index 
a reit is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and  through payments of dividends to stockholders  is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level 
host operates as a self managed and self administered reit and owns approximately of the partnership interests of host lp 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry 
the majority of our properties are luxury and upper scale that are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
in  approximately of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort conference hotels 
while our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures  we believe this strategy should allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of those of our competitors 
we seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business  and contract business  which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our room sales 
similar to the majority of the lodging industry  we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers 
business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels 
therefore  we will be more significantly affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand 
the four key subcategories of the transient business group are premium sometimes referred to as rack rate  this rate is typically applied to rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available 
room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality  weekday vs 
weekend stays 
corporate this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public 
it is typically the second highest category  and is for travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates 
special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally 
these rates are typically negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate 
discount this encompasses all discount programs  such as aaa and aarp discounts  government per diem  rooms booked through wholesale channels  frequent guest program redemptions  and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel 

table of contents group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together  usually with a minimum of rooms 
examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion 
the three key sub categories of the group business category are association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 
corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg  product launches  training programs  contract negotiations  and presentations 
other group business predominately related to social  military  education  religious  fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams  otherwise known as smerf business 
the final category is contract demand  which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates 
contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses 
our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements under which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages  utilities  property taxes and other hotel level expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period  which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation 
hotel revenue is approximately of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the hotel s restaurants 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  entertainment and other guest services 

table of contents hotel operating expenses are approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental and support expenses 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking  golf courses  spas  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue 
incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures 
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations 
it is also worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items  however  taken separately these costs represent approximately of our hotel operating expenses 
key performance indicators 
revenue per available room  or revpar  is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include food and beverage or parking  telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
revpar changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels  as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in additional room related costs 
as a result  changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels 
in discussing our operating results  we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the 
table of contents reporting periods being compared 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage  large scale capital improvements or significant events during these periods 
we also evaluate the performance of our business through non gaap financial measures  including funds from operations ffo per diluted share and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit 
we use ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit  which is a non gaap measure used to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability 
the comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels 
each of the non gaap measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit and earnings per share 
we provide a more detailed discussion of these non gaap financial measures  how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance as well as certain limitations of such measures 
see non gaap financial measures 
summary of operating results during  the economic recession  both domestically and internationally  and the continued fall out from the collapse of the credit markets in contributed to a significant decrease in gdp  corporate profits and business and consumer spending  as well as a significant increase in the unemployment rate 
these factors combined to depress overall lodging demand  which resulted in historical levels of decline in occupancy and average room rates 
in addition to these economic drivers  political pressure and public relations concerns over corporate travel further diminished booking activity and reduced attendance at group events  resulting in lower banquet  food and beverage and other revenues 
meeting planners were able to take advantage of historically high room availability  which has resulted in a shift in pricing power  leading to lower average room rates 
overall  comparable revpar decreased in as a result of a decrease in occupancy of percentage points and a decrease of in average room rate with a similar decline in food and beverage revenues of 
as a result  total revenue decreased million  or  to approximately billion for the year 
net income declined million in to a loss of million 
the decline in net income primarily reflects the decline in operating profit due to the decrease in overall lodging demand described above 
the net loss also reflects million of impairment charges incurred during  million of which are included in discontinued operations 
diluted earnings per common share decreased to a 
loss in ffo per diluted share decreased  to  for the declines in diluted earnings per common share and ffo per diluted share reflect the decline in operations and the issuance of approximately million common shares throughout the year 
the declines in earnings and ffo per share during also reflect million of impairment charges and an expense accrual of approximately million related to a potential litigation loss 
during  impairment charges totaled million 
management was able to partially mitigate the decline in our operations by working with our managers to minimize margin deterioration 
during the year  we worked with our operators to implement significant contingency plans  which included right sizing the work force to the amount of business being generated  reducing discretionary spending  delaying the implementation of brand standards  closing restaurant outlets or modifying hours of operations  as well as closing specific floors or towers to reflect the decrease in occupancy 
in addition to our cost cutting measures  our managers accessed additional revenue channels  particularly e commerce channels  in an effort to offset the decline in revenues from more traditional sources 

table of contents financing activities maintaining financial flexibility was an important strategic focus throughout despite the disruption in the credit markets  we raised approximately billion in cash during the year through debt and equity issuances and hotel sales 
the proceeds have primarily been used to repay short term debt maturities and to maintain higher than historical cash levels 
as a result of these efforts at year end  we held over billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  a portion of which was used to repay or redeem million of debt in the first quarter of  further reducing our debt to approximately billion at february  we have million available under our credit facility 
during  we repaid million of mortgage debt and repurchased million face amount of exchangeable senior debentures at a million discount to the face value 
excluding the recent million in first quarter debt paydowns  our significant remaining debt maturities and obligations through year end consist of million of mortgage debt which matures in including the million orlando world center marriott mortgage  all or a portion of which can be extended for two one year periods provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met and million and million of exchangeable senior debentures  which holders have the right to put to us in april and  respectively 
as of february   of our properties are unencumbered by mortgage debt 
we maintained compliance with all of our senior note and credit facility covenants see financial condition for a detailed description of our financial covenants and our current levels of compliance 
we believe  as a result of these efforts and the overall strength of our balance sheet  we will have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current decline in our operating cash flow and to take advantage of investment opportunities going forward for a detailed discussion  see liquidity and capital resources 
investing activities acquisitions dispositions 
acquisition opportunities that conform to our portfolio criteria were nearly nonexistent in both domestically and internationally due to significantly depressed operating levels  ongoing capital market disruption and the uncertain economic outlook 
we believe that the current operating environment  combined with the significant number of hotel properties encumbered with very high levels of debt coming due in the next several years  may result in owners and or lenders making these properties available for sale due to their inability to repay the debt at maturity 
we believe that these opportunities may begin to reach the market in and as distressed owners and their lenders will first explore other options 
we have been actively exploring potential acquisitions and expect to be able to take advantage of these opportunities over time as they arise 
we disposed of six non core properties in where we believed the potential for future returns were lower than our target levels and recognized proceeds of approximately million  including the return of reserves held by the manager  that were subsequently used to repay debt and invest in our portfolio 
we recognized a gain on the dispositions totaling approximately million  net of tax 
on september   we sold our remaining limited partnership interest in cbm jv for approximately million and recorded the gain on property transaction of million  net of taxes 
as a result of this transaction  we will no longer have any continuing involvement in cbm jv 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures program consists of renewal and replacement  roi repositioning and value enhancement projects in a broad array of areas including lobbies and public spaces  food and beverage facilities  spas  retail outlets  meeting space and rooms as well as energy conservation and other non public areas of the property 
we completed million of capital expenditures in  which included million in roi repositioning expenditures and value enhancement projects at numerous properties 
these 
table of contents projects included the completion of a  square foot ballroom addition at the swiss tel chicago for approximately million  the construction of the  square foot ballroom at the ritz carlton  amelia island and the construction of the  square foot ballroom at the harbor beach marriott resort spa  which is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of in addition to the roi repositioning projects  we spent million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures 
we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position with respect to their market competitors as a result of strategic focus on maintaining and upgrading our properties through a dedicated capital expenditures program 
while overall spending on capital projects declined in  we have invested over billion in the last five years  including the renovation of approximately  rooms and million square feet of meeting space 
we anticipate that we will spend million to million on capital projects for  and we continue to look for additional ways to strategically reinvest in our portfolio using our scale and relationships to drive more cost efficient purchasing and improve the overall quality of our assets 
outlook while economic indicators suggest that the economy and the lodging industry have begun a tentative recovery in the wake of the difficult recessionary environment in  we believe that several factors  primarily uncertainty in the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery and persistently high unemployment  will continue to negatively affect lodging industry fundamentals in we do not anticipate a significant improvement in the lodging industry until key economic indicators  particularly gdp  business investment  employment  corporate profits and consumer spending  experience sustained quarter over quarter growth 
the factors discussed above will likely continue to negatively affect the group and transient demand segments in we believe occupancy  after reaching near historical lows  will begin to improve due to the back log of demand from long delayed meetings and travel 
however  we believe the recovery in occupancy will be muted as concerns over corporate expenditures will continue to diminish booking activity and decrease attendance at group events  resulting in lower banquet  food and beverage and other revenues 
similarly  the reduction in corporate travel budgets and cost concerns will continue to negatively affect transient business and leisure travel 
we believe the increase in occupancy will be offset by continued rate pressure in the lodging industry 
historically  as occupancy improves average rates will increase as the mix of business shifts away from lower rated discount and contract business to higher rated corporate and group business 
eventually  average rates will increase further as additional demand moves the pricing power away from the consumer 
for example  while we have experienced an increase in short term group bookings  our overall group booking pace remains below levels 
we believe that this is the result of meeting planners taking advantage of the historically low occupancy in the industry to book unoccupied rooms at a discount closer to their meeting date 
this shift to short term group bookings also negatively affects our ability to predict our group bookings and overall results 
similarly  for our transient business  travelers will continue to take advantage of discount booking options until the industry can sustain occupancy growth 
we believe that the lodging supply growth for upper upscale and luxury hotels will begin to abate in  and will be significantly lower in and as the recession and the disruption in the credit markets caused a significant decline in new hotel construction starts beginning in the second half of this may be particularly relevant for the markets and lodging sectors in which we compete due to the long term planning and high level of investment associated with these properties 
while we do not believe the anticipated decline in supply growth will have a significant effect on operations for  we believe that it will have a positive effect on our hotels performance in later years  as any demand growth which occurs will not be coupled with an increase in lodging supply 
the general economic trends discussed above make it difficult to predict our future operating results in we may experience further declines in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  greater than anticipated weakness in the economy  changes in travel patterns and the continued impact of the trends identified above

sales for properties disposed of in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations below 

table of contents consistent with the portfolio as a whole  comparable hotel revpar decreased  with a percentage point decrease in occupancy and a decrease in average room rates 
another factor that contributed to the decrease in revenues was corporate travelers downgrading from luxury properties to other hotel segments due to political and public relations concerns regarding corporate expenditures on luxury services 
this had a significant affect on our ritz carlton properties as well as our resort locations 
while management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market  overall we evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria property type ie urban  suburban  resort conference or airport  geographic region and mix of business ie transient  group or contract

consistent with  our urban properties continued to outperform the portfolio as a whole 
we believe the location of these assets provides a diversified demand base that helped drive higher levels of occupancy  which partially mitigated the decline in average room rate compared to other property types 
as noted above  our resort conference properties were particularly affected by traveler concerns regarding corporate expenditures for luxury hotels and services

other than the dc metro region  all of our regions had substantial declines in revpar  though results reflect the different dynamics of the major markets within each region 
revpar at hotels in our top performing dc metro region declined  though individual properties within the region varied from an increase of to a decline of in revpar  with the strongest performers being our downtown properties that benefited from government and government related activity 
similarly  the revpar decline in the south central region included a revpar decrease of in new orleans and a decline of in houston 
hotel sales by business mix 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient  group and contract business 
the information below is derived from business mix data for of our hotels for which business mix data is available from our managers 
in  transient revpar decreased when compared to  reflecting a slight decline in total room nights and a decline in average rate of 
the decline primarily reflects a shift from the higher rated premium and corporate business to the price sensitive transient discount business 
room nights for premium and corporate business declined  despite a decline in average rates of  which led to a revpar decline of in this business 
this was slightly offset by the growth in room nights from price sensitive transient discount business as customers  particularly leisure travelers  utilized discount programs implemented by our managers and third party travel websites offering discounted rates 
group revpar declined approximately reflecting a decline in total room nights of and a decline in average room rates of 
the decline in room rate was primarily due to corporate group discounts and short term group rate concessions 
the primary driver of the decline in room nights was a significant reduction in corporate group business of 
in addition to significant reductions in corporate group meetings  this also reflects low attendance at group meetings and groups increasingly renegotiating rates 
compared to hotel sales declined in due to decreases in occupancy at our properties  as well as decreases in food and beverage and other revenue items 
sales for properties disposed of in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations below 

table of contents comparable hotel revpar decreased 
the decrease in revpar was the result of a percentage point decrease in occupancy which was slightly offset by a 
increase in average room rates 
occupancy was negatively affected by the decrease in overall lodging demand 
food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels decreased  primarily due to decreased sales from our catering and banquet business and meeting room rentals and the decline in occupancy at our hotels 
other revenues for our comparable hotels  which primarily represent spa  golf  parking  internet connectivity and other fees  were down slightly

for  revpar decreased across all of our hotel property types 
revpar at our resort conference properties was particularly affected by the current economic recession due to reduced consumer spending and increased travel costs 
in particular  our hawaiian properties experienced a dramatic decline in revpar as a result of decreased airlift to the hawaiian islands and overall weak demand in this market 
revpar at our urban  airport and suburban hotels also declined due to the overall decline in lodging demand

table of contents in terms of revpar growth  our international region was the top performing region due to revpar growth at our chilean and canadian hotels and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
comparable hotel revpar growth in our florida region was driven by revpar growth at the harbor beach marriott where we benefited from prior year disruption caused by rooms renovations and the orlando world center marriott where significant discounting drove transient demand 
revpar results were partially offset by rooms renovations at three hotels in the florida region  as well as the impact of hurricane fay 
revpar growth in the south central region was the result of year over year growth in our houston market which had a strong fourth quarter due to hurricane ike induced demand as well as our san antonio properties  which experienced strong group business because of recent renovations in the fourth quarter of the revpar decline in our pacific region was driven by the revpar decline at our hawaiian properties and a decline at our san diego properties 
the region s best performer based on revpar growth was the san francisco market which had a increase in revpar 
however  the revpar growth was concentrated in the first half of the year  as revpar in san francisco declined significantly in the fourth quarter 
revpar in our new england region also declined  reflecting decreased demand at our boston hotels due to fewer city wide events and softening leisure demand 
in addition  we experienced higher group attrition and cancellations than in prior periods 
the north central region underperformed other regions  as results in chicago were particularly weak due primarily to renovations at three of our chicago properties and lower transient demand 
the atlanta region also underperformed in comparison to the overall portfolio due to weak group bookings  lower transient demand and increased supply 
revpar in our mountain region also declined as the phoenix market continued to struggle due to lower group and transient demand and rooms renovations at two hotels 
hotel sales by business mix 
the information below is derived from business mix data for of our hotels for which business mix data is available from our managers 
in  overall transient average daily rates decreased when compared to while our overall group average room rate increased almost over the prior year as most of the business was contracted prior to any significant downturn 
property level operating expenses 
change to change to in millions in millions rooms food and beverage other departmental and support expenses management fees other property level expenses depreciation and amortization total property level operating expenses compared to and compared to the overall decrease in operating expenses is consistent with lower overall demand at our properties and our hotel managers actively implementing contingency plans and cost saving measures to manage operating margin decline 
our operating costs and expenses  which are both fixed and variable  are affected by changes in occupancy  inflationary increases and revenues which affect management fees  though the effect on specific costs will differ 
property level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold during the periods presented  which are included in discontinued operations 

table of contents rooms 
the decrease in room expenses was primarily due to a decrease in occupancy 
we also benefited from cost cutting measures implemented by our managers that reduced controllable expenses  such as closing rooms in unused sections of the hotels  and reducing management staff and labor hours per occupied room 
food and beverage 
the decline in food and beverages costs was primarily driven by a decrease in occupancy  which led to a reduction in food and beverages cost of good sold  and reductions in restaurant hourly and management staff 
other departmental and support expenses 
the decline in these expenses reflected a reduction in controllable expenses such as marketing and general and administration expenses that were driven by a decrease in the wages and benefits allocated to these expenses  reflecting a decline in management staffing and bonus payouts 
additionally  utilities declined as a result of a decline in prices  lower occupancy levels and milder weather 
management fees 
our base management fees  which are generally calculated as a percentage of total revenues  declined for the year  which is consistent with our revenue decline 
the incentive management fees  which are based on the level of operating profit at each property after the owner has received a priority return on its investment  declined during as a result of the decline in operating profit at the hotel level 
other property level expenses 
these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance 
for  the slight increase was primarily driven by the increase in ground rent expense related to the new york marriott marquis  which was largely offset by decreases in insurance  equipment rental and other property level costs 
depreciation and amortization 
during  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to million of impairment charges included in continuing operations as well as an increase in depreciation expense due to our extensive billion capital expenditure program from to during  we identified properties to be tested for impairment based on certain events or circumstances that occurred which indicated that their carrying amount may not be recoverable as compared to projected undiscounted cash flows  as prescribed by gaap 
we tested these properties for impairment based on management s estimate of expected future undiscounted cash flows over our expected holding period 
as a result of these analyses  we recorded non cash property impairment charges totaling million for the year based on the difference between the fair value of these properties and their carrying amounts 
of these property impairment charges  million has been included in discontinued operations for the year to date period 
during  we identified one property for impairment and recorded million of impairment charges  which are included in discontinued operations 
see critical accounting policies impairment testing for further discussion of our policies regarding impairments 
in addition  our investment in the european joint venture exceeded its fair value on an other than temporary basis  and we recorded an impairment charge of million which is included in equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
see other income statement line items equity in earnings losses of affiliates for further detail 
other income statement line items corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits  including stock based compensation expense  as well as other costs such as travel  corporate insurance  audit fees  building rent and system costs 
corporate expenses increased approximately million in from and decreased approximately million in from the increase in includes an expense accrual of approximately million  or 
per common share  based on a range of possible outcomes for a potential litigation loss 
see legal proceedings 
additionally  higher corporate expenses reflected an increase in stock expense in a return to more normalized levels  as well as an increase in the stock price during 
table of contents gain on insurance settlement 
we recorded a gain on insurance settlement of million in and million in the gains primarily relate to the insurance proceeds received for both business interruption and property damage following hurricanes katrina and wilma which occurred during september and october  respectively 
the hurricanes caused substantial business interruption and property damage at our new orleans marriott and at five of our hotels located in southern florida 
the gain represents the insurance proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable recorded on the balance sheet at the date of loss 
the insurance receivable reflected the book value of the property and equipment written off and repairs and maintenance costs incurred from the hurricanes 
we recognize the gains on insurance settlements once all contingencies are met  and  as a result  none of the property insurance proceeds were recognized in income during or interest income 
the million decline in interest income for when compared to is primarily due to lower rates for compared to the million decline in interest income for when compared to is primarily due to lower interest rates during  as well as a slightly lower weighted average cash balance for the full year compared to interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in interest expense includes million  million and million of non cash interest expense for  and  respectively  related to our exchangeable debentures associated with the implementation of the new us gaap requirement 
see critical accounting policies implementation of new accounting standards 
the decrease of million in interest expense for from is primarily due to an expense of million related to call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with debt prepayments during compared to a million gain in related to the repurchase of million principal amount of our debentures 
the decline in interest expense also reflects the decrease in our weighted average interest rate of percentage points to 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
in  our share of losses from affiliates increased by million compared to primarily due to the million non cash impairment charge related to our investment in the joint venture in europe and the overall decline in operations at these hotels 
results also were affected by the settlement of a lawsuit in relating to the return of an initial deposit for a terminated acquisition  which resulted in a gain of million 
we recognized a loss of million in due to uncertainties surrounding this litigation 
we evaluate the recoverability of our investment in affiliates based on our assessment of the fair value of our investment in comparison to our carrying value 
in  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in our joint venture in europe exceeded its fair value on an other than temporary basis 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million which is included in equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
see critical accounting policies other than temporary impairment of an investment for further discussion 
net income loss attributable to non controlling interests 
net income attributable to non controlling interest decreased million in and million in due to a decline in the net income of host lp during both years 
host lp net income reflects the operations at our hotels and is significantly affected by the gain on dispositions  which were million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of six hotels disposed of in including one hotel for which the ground lease expired and will revert back to the ground lessor  two hotels disposed of during and nine hotels disposed of in and represent the results of operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the periods 
the following table summarizes the revenues  income before taxes  and the gain on dispositions  net of tax  of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations  which includes assets held for sale and the results of sold hotels prior to their disposition  in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented in millions revenues income loss before taxes gain on disposals  net of tax liquidity and capital resources overview 
we seek to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash  debt and equity to provide financial flexibility to pursue opportunities given the cyclical nature of the lodging industry 
consistent with our strategic goals and the overall economic climate in  we focused on preserving capital  increasing liquidity and extending debt maturities 
we raised approximately billion through debt and equity issuances and hotel sales 
we used the proceeds from these transactions and available cash to repay million face amount of senior notes and debentures with a carrying value of million for million  to repay million outstanding under our credit facility and to repay million in mortgage debt 
we also repaid million of debt in the first quarter of as discussed below 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds to repay debt  acquire new properties and invest in our portfolio through our capital expenditure program 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to withstand declines in operating cash flow  pay our near term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditure programs 
we expect to maintain higher than historical cash levels until the credit markets stabilize and operating conditions improve

we use cash for acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt payments  operating costs  corporate and other expenses and dividends to stockholders 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income excluding net capital gain to our stockholders 
during  we took advantage of guidance issued by the irs to satisfy up to of our reit distribution requirements through the issuance of stock dividends 
therefore  we declared a

funds used to make cash distributions are provided by host lp 
our sources of cash are cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances 
set forth below is a schedule of our debt maturities through as of december   our weighted average interest rate is and our weighted average maturity is years 
our remaining near term debt maturities in and are relatively low 
maturities in total million and include the million orlando world center marriott mortgage  which is subject to extension  in whole or in part  at our option if certain requirements are met 
see financial condition for more information on our debt maturities 
during the first quarter of  we used the proceeds from the issuance of the debentures and available cash to redeem the remaining million of series m senior notes which were due in august and to repay the million mortgage on the atlanta marriott marquis 
due to these repayments  the million in maturities have been excluded in the chart below remaining debt maturities in millions exchangeable senior debentures mortgage loan on four canadian properties

our exchangeable senior debentures are due in  but are subject to a put option by the holders on april  the million represents the face amount of the outstanding principal at december  capital resources 
as of december   we had over billion of cash and cash equivalents  which was an increase of billion from december  we also had million available under our credit facility at december  during the first quarter of  we redeemed or repaid million of outstanding debt with our available cash 
we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
as a result  the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure 
therefore  our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants  which include  among others  the allowable amounts of leverage  coverage and fixed charges 
during  as operations at our hotels declined  management completed several debt and equity transactions in order to mitigate the effects of the decline in operations on our financial flexibility 
as a result of these efforts  we have significantly decreased our near term debt maturities  reduced our secured mortgage indebtedness and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants  despite the decline in operating results at our hotels 
if  at any time  we determine that market conditions are favorable  after taking into account our liquidity requirements  we may seek to issue and sell shares of host common stock in registered public offerings  including through sales directly on the nyse under our current at the market offering program referred to above  or to issue and sell shares of host preferred stock 
we may also seek to cause host lp to issue  in offerings exempt from registration under the securities laws  debentures exchangeable for shares of our common 
table of contents stock or senior notes 
given our total debt level  typically a portion will come due every year and for that reason we may also continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time  taking advantage of favorable market conditions when available 
in february  host s board of directors authorized repurchases up to million of senior notes  exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms 
we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and ffo per diluted share  as defined below  as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs 
accordingly  in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile  and given the movement in prevailing conditions in the capital markets  we may  at any time  subject to applicable securities laws  be considering  or be in discussions with respect to  the purchase or sale of common stock  exchangeable debentures and or senior notes 
any such transactions may  subject to applicable securities laws  occur contemporaneously 
as of february   subsequent to the repayment of the million mortgage loan on the atlanta marriott marquis  our secured mortgage indebtedness totaled approximately billion  which represents approximately of our overall indebtedness  and is secured by of our hotels 
accordingly  of our hotels are unencumbered by mortgage debt 
given the flexibility provided by the structure of our balance sheet  we will look to access the capital markets for senior notes and exchangeable debentures and the secured mortgage debt market  based on relative pricing and capacity to fund our cash requirements 
we may  at any time  seek to access such markets in the event that we determine that the terms and conditions available to us are advantageous based upon prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other circumstances 
see financial condition for further discussion of our restrictive covenants 
counterparty credit risk 
we are subject to counterparty credit risk  which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price 
as a result of the recent bankruptcy and insolvency of several high profile  well respected financial institutions  we have performed additional assessments to determine the impact  if any  of these market developments on our financial condition 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions  access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts 
our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited 
our exposure with regard to our cash and the million available under our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions 
at december   our exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions 
sources and uses of cash 
during  our primary sources of cash included cash from operations  proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from the sale of assets 
uses of cash during the year primarily consisted of capital expenditures  operating costs and debt repayments and repurchases 
uses of cash during will include the repayment or repurchase of our debt maturing in the near term  capital expenditures at our hotels and dividends on our preferred stock 
other uses may include  among other things  investment in our european  asian or other joint ventures or hotel acquisitions 
we anticipate that our primary sources of cash for will include cash from operations and proceeds from hotel dispositions and equity issuances 
cash provided by operations 
our cash provided by operations for decreased million to million compared to  due primarily to declines in operations at our hotels 
cash used in investing activities 
approximately million of cash was used in investing activities during this included approximately million of capital expenditures  partially offset by the return of a million investment in the european joint venture and million of net proceeds from the disposition of assets 

table of contents capital expenditures in  total capital expenditures decreased million to million 
our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for were approximately million  which reflects a decrease of approximately from levels 
our renewal and replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture  fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels typically funded with approximately of property revenues and by our available cash 
we also spent approximately million in on roi repositioning projects  which reflects a decrease of approximately compared to levels 
while capital expenditures declined in  they have totaled approximately billion over the past five years 
as a result  we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position with respect to their market competitors 
acquisitions dispositions and investments during  we disposed of six non core properties where we believed the potential for revenue growth was low 
proceeds from these sales were approximately million  including the return of reserves held by the manager  and were used to repay debt and invest in our portfolio 
we recognized a gain on the dispositions totaling approximately million  net of tax  in on september   we sold our remaining limited partnership interest in cbm jv for approximately million and recorded the gain on property transaction of million  net of taxes 
as a result of this transaction  we no longer have any continuing involvement in cbm jv 
we did not complete any acquisitions in or we believe that the current operating environment  combined with the significant number of hotel properties encumbered with very high levels of debt  may result in owners and or lenders making these properties available for sale due to their inability to repay the debt at maturity 
we believe that these opportunities may not reach the market until and or subsequent years as distressed owners and their lenders will first explore other options 
however  we have been actively exploring potential acquisitions and expect to be able to take advantage of these opportunities over time as they arise 
we may also purchase mortgage debt that is secured by hotel properties or mezzanine debt where we believe we can buy the debt at a discount and earn attractive returns through principal and interest payments or the eventual ownership of the hotel through foreclosure 
we may acquire additional properties through various structures  including transactions involving single assets  portfolios  joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities 
we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods  including proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio  the incurrence of debt  available cash  advances under our credit facility  proceeds from equity offerings of host  or issuance of op units by host lp

senior notes 
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes at specified dates in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior 
table of contents notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lp s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp 
the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  as well as our credit facility  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
because our leverage ratio is below this threshold  we have the right to release all pledges at any time 
in october  we exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that would have been otherwise required subsequent to this date 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x by host lp 
furthermore  host lp is able to make distributions to enable host to pay dividends on its preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our ebitda to interest coverage ratio is above to this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings  as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and approximately million of interest expense recorded in related to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture  however  in certain circumstances  we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
these unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants unless they are guarantors and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional indebtedness without complying with the restrictive covenants in the indenture 
if we were to designate additional subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries  neither the ebitda generated by nor the interest expense allocated to these entities would be included in our ratio calculations 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values  excluding intangible assets  and secured indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
the decline in operations over the past two years has caused a decline in our ebitda to interest coverage ratio 
if economic conditions continue to weaken  we would expect this trend to continue 
however  even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and pay dividends  we are still permitted to incur certain types of debt  including i credit facility debt  ii refinancing debt  iii up to million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount  and iv up to million of other debt 
we also are permitted to pay dividends of estimated taxable income necessary to maintain host s reit status 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as our ability to pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our equity interests  make investments  permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries  sell assets  guarantee indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets as defined in the indenture as undepreciated property value of not less than of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages 
this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or pay dividends discussed above whose consequences  where we fall below the coverage level  are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or pay dividends  but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture

exchangeable debentures general 
we separately account for the liability and equity components of our exchangeable debentures to reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our non convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date 
accordingly  for our exchangeable senior debentures the debentures  our exchangeable senior debentures the debentures and our exchangeable senior debentures the debentures collectively  the debentures  we record the liability components of the debentures at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt  however  there is no effect on our cash interest payments 
we measured the fair value of the debt components of the debentures  debentures and debentures at issuance based on effective interest rates of  and  respectively 
as a result  we attributed million of the proceeds received to the conversion feature of the debentures 
this amount represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the debt at the date of issuance and is included in additional paid in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets

credit facility 
on may   we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit facility with deutsche bank ag new york branch  as administrative agent  bank of america  na  as syndication agent  citicorp north america inc  soci t g n rale and calyon new york branch  as co documentation agents and certain other agents and lenders 
the credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of million 
during any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x  new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed million 
the credit facility also includes subcommitments for i the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million and ii loans in certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of million  a million of which may be loaned to certain of our canadian subsidiaries in canadian dollars and b million of which may be loaned to us in pounds sterling and euros 
the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of september we have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met as of september these conditions include the payment of a fee to the lenders  that no default or event of default exists and maintaining a leverage ratio below x 
subject to certain conditions  we also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders  whether or not currently party to the credit facility  commits to be a lender for such amount 
in  we entered into a million term loan under the credit facility 
in  we also borrowed million under the revolver portion of our credit facility at a rate of libor plus basis points based on our leverage 
the term loan and the credit facility were repaid in  and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
based on our leverage at december   we have million of available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility 
the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied  including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as a result of having satisfied such conditions  currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary  and at our election  we may obtain a release of all existing pledges for so long as our leverage ratio continues to be below x 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility  as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
financial covenants 
the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage 
due to the decline in operations over the past two years  our unsecured interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio have declined and our leverage ratio has increased 
if economic conditions continue to weaken  we would expect this trend to continue 
we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than x 
if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x  new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed million 
however  to the extent our borrowings under the credit facility revolver exceed million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds x  we are not required to repay the excess for one year 
the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility 
hence  so long as there are no amounts outstanding  we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants 
these calculations are performed in accordance with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the 
table of contents extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and  approximately million of interest expense recorded in as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard relating to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of million is deducted from our total debt balance 
we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility 
the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december  actual ratio covenant requirement leverage ratio x maximum ratio of x x x fixed charge coverage ratio x minimum ratio of x x x unsecured interest coverage ratio a x minimum ratio of x x x a if at any time our leverage ratio is above x  our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will lower to x 
interest and fees 
we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates plus a margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio 
in the case of libor borrowings in us dollars  as well as euros and pounds sterling denominated borrowings  the rate of interest ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
we also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight federal funds rate plus basis points and the prime lending rate  plus  in both cases  the applicable spread ranging from to basis points 
based on our leverage ratio at december  of x  we can borrow at a rate of libor plus basis points or prime plus basis points 
to the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of to basis points  depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period 
other covenants 
the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters 
certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below x 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments and dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
additionally  the credit facility s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture 
these provisions  under certain circumstances  limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing  and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain our tax status as a reit 
mortgage and other debt 
as of december   we had hotels that were secured by mortgage debt 
after the repayment of the million mortgage on the atlanta marriott marquis  we currently have hotels that are secured by mortgage debt 
substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
as of december   secured debt represented approximately of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of and an average maturity of years

other mortgage debt consists of individual mortgage debt amounts that are less than million  have an average interest rate of at december  and mature through industrial revenue bonds and other consist of loans with an average interest rate of that mature through  and capital leases with varying interest rates and maturity dates 

table of contents mortgage debt of consolidated and unconsolidated partner interests 
for the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party non controlling partnership interests  the portion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to the non controlling interests  based on their percentage of ownership of the partnerships  is approximately million 
additionally  we have non controlling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method 
the portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships attributable to us  based on our percentage of ownership of the partnerships  was million at december  nearly all of this debt balance is attributable to our ownership interest in the european joint venture 
the mortgage debt related to our european joint venture hotels contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or make principal repayments without penalty 
the debt of all our unconsolidated partnerships is non recourse to us 
see off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 
credit ratings 
as of december   we have approximately billion of senior notes outstanding and million of preferred stock that are rated by moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch ratings 
moody s rating on our senior note debt is ba and our preferred stock is ba  both with a negative outlook 
during  standard poor s downgraded our senior note debt one notch from bbb  the lowest investment grade rating  to bb 
standard poor s rating on our preferred stock is at b 
in addition  standard poor s has maintained its negative outlook 
during  fitch ratings downgraded our senior note debt from bb to bb 
the rating on our preferred stock was also downgraded from bb to b 
fitch ratings has also placed us on negative outlook 
if our operations or our credit ratios continue to decline  the ratings on our securities could be further reduced 
if we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings  our cost to issue senior notes  either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise  or additional preferred stock would likely increase 
dividend policy 
host is required to distribute at least of its annual taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a reit  including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash 
funds used by host to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from host lp 
as of february   host is the owner of substantially all of the preferred op units and approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
host intends to reinstate its quarterly common dividend payment and to pay a 
per share dividend with respect to its common stock beginning in the first quarter of even if we do not have taxable income in host s policy on common dividends is generally to distribute  over time  of its taxable income 
we suspended our regular quarterly common dividend beginning in the fourth quarter of and  for  instead declared a 
per share special common dividend in the fourth quarter  described in more detail below 
host currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock  regardless of the amount of its taxable income  unless contractually restricted 
the amount of any future dividend will be determined by host s board of directors 
on september   host s board of directors authorized a special dividend of per share of common stock of host  payable in cash and shares of host common stock  at the election of the stockholder 
the dividend was paid on december  to holders of record as of november  in order to comply with host s remaining reit taxable income distribution requirements for the year ended december   while retaining capital and maintaining maximum financial flexibility  host s board of directors determined that the cash component of the dividend other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares would not exceed in the aggregate 
after giving effect to stockholder elections and the effect of the cash limitation  the dividend paid consisted of approximately million shares of host common stock of the dividend and million of cash of the dividend 
pursuant to the third amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of host lp  as amended the partnership agreement  common op unit holders received the cash distribution of of the per 
table of contents share dividend paid by host to its common stockholders  or per op unit  but did not receive an equivalent per unit distribution for the of the dividend paid with host common stock 
therefore  subsequent to the issuance of shares of common stock to stockholders of host  the conversion factor used to convert op units into shares of host common stock was adjusted from to  so that upon redemption  to the extent host exercises its right to provide payment of the redemption price with shares of host common stock  each op unit may now be redeemed for shares of host common stock 
the above adjustment to the conversion factor was made to avoid any unintended dilution as a result of the portion of host s dividend paid with shares of its common stock to its stockholders 
investors should take into account the non controlling position of host lp common op units when analyzing common and preferred dividend payments by host to its stockholders  as these holders share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding common and preferred op units 
for example  if host paid a per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on payment of a per common unit distribution by host lp to host  as well as to other common op unit holders 
additionally  when host pays a preferred dividend  host lp pays an equivalent per unit distribution on its preferred op units 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements 
we are party to various transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees 
as of december   we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated investments 
in march  we formed a joint venture  hhr euro cv  to acquire hotels in europe 
we serve as the general partner for the european joint venture and have a ownership interest including our general and limited partner interests 
due to the ownership structure and the non host limited partners rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the european joint venture at any time  it is not consolidated in our financial statements 
our investment balance at december  in the joint venture is approximately million million  which includes the effect of the impairment of the investment recorded in described below 
as of december   the aggregate size of the european joint venture was approximately billion billion  including total capital contributions of approximately million million  of which a total of approximately million million was from our contribution of cash and the sheraton warsaw hotel towers 
under the joint venture s partnership agreement  the aggregate size of the european joint venture can increase to approximately million of equity of which approximately million would be contributed by host lp and  once all funds have been invested  would represent approximately billion of assets 
the european joint venture has million in mortgage debt  none of which is recourse to us  and all of which either has  or has the potential to trigger covenant defaults  cash sweeps or non payment defaults 
the european joint venture has initiated discussions with the lenders of mortgage loans totaling million that are due in and that have breached financial covenants 
these loans are secured by nine properties in total  comprising one portfolio of six hotels located in spain  italy  poland and the united kingdom and one portfolio of three hotels located in brussels 
each portfolio is cross collateralized  meaning that a default under one loan in the portfolio could trigger a default on the loans for the other properties in the portfolio 
the joint venture has the right to cure certain covenants  including debt service coverage and loan to value covenants  a limited number of times by making cash deposits 
if discussions with the lenders are unsuccessful  and the european joint venture does not elect to cure the defaults  the lenders may  among other remedies  accelerate the loans 
these mortgage loans are non recourse to host and our partners and a default under these loans does not trigger a default under any of host s debt 

table of contents the terms of this joint venture agreement limit the life of the investment to  with two one year extensions 
during the second quarter  we determined that our investment was impaired based on the reduction of distributable cash flows from the joint venture  which has been caused primarily by a decline in cash flows generated by the properties 
we believe this impairment to be other than temporary as defined by gaap because the time period over which the joint venture may be able to improve operations such that our investment would be fully recoverable is constrained by the remaining life of the joint venture 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling million during based on the difference between the estimated fair value of our investment and its carrying value 
this impairment is included in equity in earnings losses of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations 
see critical accounting policies other than temporary impairment of an investment and note  investments in affiliates  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during  we entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts to hedge approximately of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the european joint venture 
we hedged million approximately million of our investment and the forward purchase will occur between august and may during and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively related to the change in the fair value of the forward purchase contracts 
the current value of the forward contracts of million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet 
the derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  and  in accordance with sfas  are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders equity portion of our balance sheet 
for additional detail on the foreign currency forward purchase contracts and our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on march   we entered into a joint venture  structured as a singapore corporation  to explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout asia  including india  china and japan  and australia the asian joint venture 
we own a interest in the asian joint venture 
the initial term of the asian joint venture is for a period of seven years 
due to the ownership structure of the asian joint venture  and our partner s rights to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the asian joint venture at any time  it is not consolidated in our financial statements 
currently  the asian joint venture does not own any hotels 
we are currently the asset manager for two third party owned hotel properties in asia in exchange for fees  and we are seeking additional asset management opportunities in asia 
tax sharing arrangements 
under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  hms host and barcel crestline corporation  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
additionally  under the partnership agreement between host and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host  as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host 
we do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangements to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
for reasons relating to federal and state income tax considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
two of these agreements will expire in and the third will expire in 
table of contents guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent certain divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by barcel crestline corporation  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
in connection with the sale of two hotels in january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote  and in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations 
the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate 
the less than one year obligations include million of our series m senior notes and the million mortgage on the atlanta marriott marquis  which were repaid on january   and february   respectively 
future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the hpt subleases of approximately million and million  respectively  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years 
the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense 
under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel  and  is therefore  not determinable 
the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
purchase price allocations to hotels 
investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value 
any remaining unallocated acquisition costs would be treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
impairment testing 
we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and  as a result  recorded million of property impairments in the first and second quarters of we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property s carrying value over its fair value 
to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life  it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property s carrying value 
in the absence of other factors  we assume that the estimable life is equal to the gaap depreciable life  because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements 
we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise  such as an expiring ground lease  or it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when a property has current or projected loss from operations  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or when other events  trends  contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  both from operations and the eventual disposition  expected useful life and holding period  future required capital expenditures  and fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 

table of contents while we consider all of the above indicators  as a preliminary indicator to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows  we reviewed the actual year to date and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december  the projected cash flows are prepared by our third party managers and consider items such as booking pace  occupancy  room rate and property level operating costs 
we review the projections and may adjust them as we deem appropriate 
as a result of our review  we identified properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
we assumed a rate of growth of projected cash flows over the estimated useful life of the individual properties  which growth rate was adjusted lower than the historical growth rate in order to reflect the current economic climate 
management considered a range of revpar and operating margin declines compared to the prior year operating results in evaluating the projected cash flows from operations 
based on this test  no properties exhibited an impaired value at december  for purposes of this test  if we had assumed a growth rate of  two of the properties identified above would have required further analysis  including testing the property using a probability weighted undiscounted cash flow analysis 
management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions 
management will adjust these measures as appropriate for changes therein in future periods and we could incur additional impairment changes if economic conditions continue to remain weak 
other than temporary impairment of an investment 
we review our equity method investments for other than temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other than temporary basis 
triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment  a change in the expected useful life or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment 
our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties  therefore  we will generally have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment  as well as considering the impact of other elements ie control premiums  ie we use certain inputs  such as available third party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties  to estimate the expected cash flows 
if an equity method investment is impaired  a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment 
classification of assets as held for sale 
our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable  will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the planned sale will be withdrawn 
this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed  the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
specifically  we will typically classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met our board of directors has approved the sale to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
to the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
see the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and 
table of contents timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  of consolidated deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of derivative contracts 
we will occasionally enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency swaps  caps and collars 
derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income  based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts and guarantees 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
stock compensation 
we recognize costs resulting from our share based payment transactions in our financial statements over their vesting periods 
we classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards 
the classification of our restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options 
equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant 
liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
the value of these restricted stock awards  less estimated forfeitures  is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
these awards were classified as liability awards due to settlement features that allowed the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the minimum required by tax statutes 
during  we implemented a new employee stock plan for our senior management that included the following awards restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
these awards are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement features 
therefore  they are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
we utilize a simulation  or monte carlo model  to determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates  the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited 

table of contents restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions 
these awards are earned based on an employee s achieving a specified performance target  which will be based on the employee s specific management business objectives 
compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable of achievement 
if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable of achievement  recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome 
these awards are also considered liability awards due to the cash settlement provisions 
therefore  the value of the shares to be issued will be based on the share price on the reporting date 
stock option awards 
the stock option awards are equity awards  as they do not include cash settlement features 
therefore  the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in the fair value 
vesting for these awards is based on service conditions 
the utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited 
other awards 
during  we granted restricted stock awards to all of our employees with vesting based on service conditions 
these awards are equity classified awards as they do not have an option for excess tax withholding similar to that for awards to senior management 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
we have investments in entities that own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting 
these entities are considered to be voting interest entities 
the debt on these investments is non recourse to us and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material 
while we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures presented under the equity method  if we were required to do so  then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements 
application of new accounting standards 
business combinations 
this new accounting pronouncement provides principles on the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
the pronouncement particularly requires the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and non controlling interests to be measured at the acquisition date fair value  including contingent considerations 
furthermore  the pronouncement prohibits acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  from being applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
we adopted the provisions of this pronouncement on january  we do not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will materially affect the recognition and measurement related to our future business combinations 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
the fasb recently amended its guidance surrounding a company s analysis to determine whether any of its variable interests constitute controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the 
table of contents activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the new guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november  and  accordingly  we will reevaluate our interests in variable interest entities for the period beginning on january  to determine that the entities are reflected properly in the financial statements as investments or consolidated entities 
we do not anticipate that the implementation of this guidance will have any material effect on our financial statements 
comparable hotel operating statistics we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption  or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared 
all of the hotels that we owned on december  have been classified as comparable hotels 
the operating results of the eight hotels we disposed of in and are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein 
moreover  because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties  they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments 
we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type 
these divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry 
geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed pacific california  hawaii  oregon and washington  mountain arizona and colorado  north central illinois  indiana  michigan  minnesota  missouri and ohio  south central louisiana  tennessee and texas  new england connecticut  massachusetts and new hampshire  mid atlantic pennsylvania  new jersey and new york  dc metro maryland  virginia and washington  dc  atlanta georgia and north carolina  florida florida  and international canada  mexico and chile 
property types consist of the following urban hotels located in primary business districts of major cities  suburban hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets  resort conference hotels located in resort conference destinations such as arizona  florida  hawaii and southern california  and airport hotels located at or near airports 

table of contents reporting periods 
for consolidated statement of operations 
the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott  the manager of a significant percentage of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt and starwood  report results on a monthly basis 
host  as a reit  is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott but our fourth quarter ends on december and our full year results  as reported in our statement of operations  always includes the same number of days as the calendar year 
two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for  and note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december while the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott  another consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately of total revenues of our hotels 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results 
for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results 
in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott for our marriott managed hotels 
however  for years such as  where marriott reports its operations based on a week year and a fourth quarter of weeks  for comparable purposes  we exclude the extra week of operations  and we still reflect weeks for the full year and weeks for the fourth quarter 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results will typically differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations

they are as follows i ffo per diluted share  and ii comparable hotel operating results 
the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ffo per diluted share 
we present ffo per diluted share as a non gaap measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate ffo per diluted share for a given operating period as our ffo defined as set forth below for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period 
nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  in accordance with nareit guidelines 
we believe that ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that such a measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits  even though ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we calculate ffo per diluted share  in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation  capital expenditures and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial 
table of contents measures 
ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  ffo per diluted share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to our stockholders benefit 
the following tables provide a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders per share to ffo per diluted share in millions  except per share amounts reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to funds from operations per diluted share year ended december  net income loss less net income loss attributable to non controlling interests dividends on preferred stock net income loss available to common stockholders adjustments gains on dispositions  net of taxes amortization of deferred gains and other property transactions  net of taxes depreciation and amortization a partnership adjustments ffo of non controlling interests of host lp adjustments for dilutive securities b assuming conversion of exchangeable senior debentures assuming deduction of gain recognized for the repurchase of exchangeable debentures c diluted ffo d e diluted weighted average shares outstanding d e diluted ffo per share d e a in accordance with the guidance on ffo per diluted share provided by the national association of real estate investment trusts  we do not adjust net income for the non cash impairment charges when determining our ffo per diluted share 
b ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities 
dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans  preferred op units held by non controlling partners  exchangeable debt securities and other non controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common op units 
no effect is shown for securities if they are anti dilutive 
c during the first quarter of and fourth quarter of  we repurchased million and million face amount  respectively  of the debentures with a carrying value of million and million for million and million  respectively 
the adjustments to dilutive ffo related to the debentures repurchased during the year include the million and million gain on repurchase in and  respectively  net of interest expense on the repurchased debentures

e ffo per diluted share and loss per diluted share include a million tax benefit  or 
per common share  related to the reversal of an excess deferred tax liability that was established in prior periods associated with our investment in cbm jv  which was sold on september  comparable hotel operating results 
we present certain operating results for our hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store basis as supplemental information for investors 
we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization  because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes 
table of contents that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
currently  we have no derivative financial instruments held for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks 
currently  our interest payments on of our debt are fixed in nature this percentage does not include million of mortgage debt for which we have swapped fixed interest payments for floating interest payments  which largely mitigates the effect of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments 
valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments  discounted at risk adjusted rates 
senior notes and the exchangeable senior debentures are valued based on quoted market prices 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by basis points  interest expense would increase or decrease  respectively  our future earnings and cash flows by approximately million in the table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

after these repayments  debt maturities total million 
the amounts are net of unamortized discounts and premiums 
the interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of december  no adjustments are made for forecasted changes in the rate 
fair value interest rate hedges 
during  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount totaling million related to the ritz carlton  naples and newport beach marriott hotel spa mortgage loan in the amount of million 
we entered into the derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of the fixed rate mortgage that occur as a result of changes in the month libor rate 
as a result  we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the month libor  plus a spread which ranges from to  as opposed to the fixed rate of  on the notional amount of million through march  we have designated these derivatives as fair value hedges 
the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield 
table of contents curve on the date of measurement 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps 
as of december   we recorded a liability of million related to the fair value of the swaps 
at the same time  we record the change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the month libor rate as a reduction to the carrying amount of the debt  or 
million  at december  the difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship 
we recognized a loss of 
million related to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship in changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as gains losses on derivatives 
interest rate cap derivative 
in connection with the mortgage debt secured by the jw marriott  washington  dc  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement which caps the libor rate at through the life of the loan 
at december   the variable interest rate on the loan was and the fair value of the cap was million 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the cap 
we recognized a gain of 
million based on the changes in the fair value of the derivative during the year 
changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as gains losses on derivatives 
exchange rate sensitivity as we have non us operations specifically  the ownership of hotels in canada  mexico and chile and an investment in our european joint venture  currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business 
to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non us hotels  where possible  we may enter into forward or option contracts 
the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
during  we entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling million approximately million to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the european joint venture 
pursuant to these transactions  we will sell the euro amount  and receive the us dollar amount on the forward purchase date 
these derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation and are marked to market with changes in fair value and recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity portion of our balance sheet 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps
