item business life partners general 
life partners holdings  inc we or life partners is a specialty financial services company and the parent company of life partners  inc lpi 
lpi is the oldest and one of the most active companies in the united states engaged in the secondary market for life insurance known generally as life settlements 
lpi facilitates the sale of life settlements between sellers and purchasers  but does not take possession or control of the policies 
the purchasers acquire the life insurance policies at a discount to their face value for investment purposes 
the secondary market for life insurance policies 
lpi was incorporated in and has conducted business under the registered service mark life partners since our operating revenues are derived from fees for facilitating life settlement transactions 
life settlement transactions involve the sale of an existing life insurance policy to another party 
by selling the policy  the policyholder receives an immediate cash payment to use as he or she wishes 
the purchaser takes an ownership interest in the policy at a discount to its face value and receives their ownership interest in the death benefit under the policy when the insured dies 
we are a specialty financial services company  providing purchasing services for life settlements to our client base 
we facilitate these transactions by identifying  examining  and purchasing the policies as agent for the purchasers 
to meet market demand and maximize our value to our clients  we have made significant investments in proprietary software and processes that enable us to facilitate a higher volume of transactions while maintaining our quality controls 
since our inception  we have facilitated over  purchaser transactions involving over  policies totaling over billion in face value 
we believe our experience  infrastructure and intellectual capital provide us a unique market position and will enable us to maintain sustainable growth within the life settlement market 
we act as a purchasing agent for life settlement purchasers 
in performing these services  we identify  qualify and purchase policies on behalf of our clients that match their buying parameters and return expectations 
because we are obliged to work within these parameters  we must make offers that are competitive from the seller s point of view  but still fit within the buying parameters of our clients 
this success based compensation formula ensures that we bring value to both parties to the transaction and that both purchaser and seller are satisfied 
we locate potential policy owners through a network of life settlement brokers and  to a lesser extent  through insurance  financial and estate planning professionals  through personal referrals and through internet and print media advertising 
brokers are typically compensated based on a percentage of the face value of the policy sold and this amount is negotiated between the policyholder and the broker 
this compensation is paid upon the closing of a settlement 
estate planning professionals and financial planners typically operate on a fee for service basis  which is paid directly by their client 
we have long term relationships with many of the country s life settlement brokers and  for those that we transact business with  believe that these brokers adhere to applicable regulatory requirements when conducting their business 
broker referrals accounted for of our total business as measured by policy face value in each of fiscal  and in fiscal  only one broker made referrals whose policy face values represented over of our total business 
referrals from this broker accounted for of our total business 
in fiscal  we had three brokers with or more of our total business and they accounted for of our total business 
in fiscal  we had three brokers with or more of our total business and they accounted for of our total business 
we are encountering more brokers in the market and believe that greater competition among brokers has reduced our supply concentration risk 
we categorize our purchasers of life settlements as either institutional or retail 
institutional purchasers are typically investment funds designed to acquire and hold life settlements 
from the beginning of fiscal  we have acted as the purchasing agent for one institutional fund  in which we have a million investment as of february  the institutional fund has acquired policies through us having a face value of million 
the institutional fund accounted for  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we have pursued the sponsorship of two funds ourselves 
in fiscal  we initiated a fund to raise from million to million to acquire policies  but were not successful in obtaining sufficient subscriptions to close the fund 
the fund was structured as a limited partnership and we offered the interests ourselves and through placing brokers in a private placement 
in fiscal  we initiated a second fund to raise million 
this fund is also structured as a limited partnership  and we are offering the interests ourselves and through placing brokers to a small number of qualified investor in a private placement 
the fund has not closed and we cannot ensure that we will raise the required capital 
we have pursued the sponsorship of funds believing that these funds will expand our retail efforts by affording purchasers an alternative to the current retail model in which purchasers acquire direct interests in policies 
we believe that securities brokers are accustomed to seeing investment products in a fund structure and their familiarity with funds structures may increase broker interest 
we also believe the fund structure will aid market penetration by enabling us to sell in states that treat life settlement transactions as securities  which limits or blocks our ability to sell in those states 
the majority of our clients are high net worth individuals  which we refer to as retail purchasers 
our retail purchasers generally come to us through a network of financial planners  whom we call licensees 
we developed this network through referrals and have long standing relationships with most of these financial planners 
although the financial planners can be compensated through fee based consultations paid by the purchaser  we compensate most of the financial planners based on the amount invested 
the compensation of financial planners is paid in cash upon the closing date of the transaction 
to purchase a life settlement  a prospective retail purchaser typically submits a purchaser application containing personal information such as the purchaser s name and address as well as affirmative representations establishing the purchaser as financially sophisticated 
a purchaser will also submit an agency agreement and special power of attorney  which appoints us as a limited agent of the purchaser to act on his or her behalf in purchasing a life settlement 
unless specifically waived by a purchaser  the agency agreement limits our authority to policies issued by an insurance carrier having an am best company rating of b or better and to policies beyond their contestable period generally two years or older 
for most of the policies that we broker on behalf of our clients  the insureds have a life expectancy of between months and months  although we can identify policies with longer life expectancies or other purchasing parameters if requested by our clients 
as we identify and qualify policies  we distribute insurance and current medical status information on these policies with the insured s name and other identifying information redacted throughout our financial planner network 
we also make available to each purchaser  through their financial planner  standard disclosures discussing the nature and risks of making a life settlement purchase 
purchasers can then  in consultation with their financial planner or other professionals  select one or more policies  specify the portion of the policy or policies to be purchased and submit a reservation electronically 
to diversify their positions  retail purchasers generally buy fractional interests in one or more policies and not an entire policy  while institutional purchasers tend to purchase entire policies 
prior to reserving an interest  purchasers mail or wire funds for acquisition of the policies to an escrow agent and mail or electronically deliver a policy funding agreement to us 
the policy funding agreement identifies the policy or policies to be purchased  the acquisition price  the administrative services provided  and the escrow arrangements for receipt and disbursement of funds 
for the protection of the seller s ownership interest and the purchaser s monetary interest  all transactions are closed through an outside escrow agent 
the escrow agent will close a purchase when it receives from each purchaser executed policy funding agreements and the acquisition price for a policy  verifies that the policy is in full force and effect and that no security interest has attached to the policy  and receives a transfer of policy ownership form acknowledged by the insurance company 
the escrow agent then pays the seller the offer price net of fees and costs 
we send confirmation of the transaction to the purchaser as well as a copy of the assignment documents 
after closing the transaction  we generally hold title to the policy as nominee for the purchaser 
responsibility for policy premium costs passes to the purchaser  who typically funds the premium costs from the deposits with the escrow agent 
we strictly maintain the confidentiality of an insured s personal information in accordance with regulations promulgated by the texas department of insurance and other applicable state laws 
a purchaser will receive evidence of the transfer of ownership of the policy which identifies the insured  but will not receive contact information for the insured  which is available only to licensed life settlement companies like us 
we perform certain ministerial functions  such as monitoring the insured s health status and notifying the escrow agent upon the insured s death 
we also notify purchasers in instances in which the premium escrow account has been exhausted so that the purchaser can replenish the account to keep the policy from lapsing 
conflicts of interest 
our business model can pose conflicts of interest  which may arise when we purchase policies for our own account while purchasing policies for others 
conflicts could arise between retail and institutional purchasers if we were to favor one over the other 
a financial incentive to favor one over the other could exist if the compensation that we earn is higher with one type of purchaser than the other or  in the case of institutional purchasers  if we have a financial interest in the institutional purchaser 
we have pursued the sponsorship of funds that would acquire policies 
if we were to close a sponsored fund  the fund would purchase interests in policies alongside with and on similar terms as our retail clients and would not have a conflict of interest 
however  it is possible that retail clients and funds might compete with institutional purchasers for policies and would pose conflicts of interest 
we believe that several factors mitigate the conflicts 
we work to ensure the neutral pricing of policies  that is  that policies are priced according to the value and risk presented 
if pricing is neutral  there is no financial reason for favoring one policy over another 
one factor in policy pricing is assessing life expectancy  which is determined in our model by an independent medical doctor 
once we have the life expectancy  we apply a pricing formula to determine the purchase price 
further  most sellers are represented by experienced brokers  who know the market for settlements 
another factor that reduces the impact of conflicts is that policies are typically sold in pieces rather than in whole 
thus  several purchasers participate side by side in a single policy  which diminishes the risk that one purchaser might be favored over another purchaser 
the methods by which purchasers select policies also reduce the potential for conflicts 
retail purchasers choose the policies in which they wish to participate from the available policies posted on our website 
institutional purchasers will typically set the parameters of policies that they wish to acquire 
we also avoid conflicts since we rarely compete against our retail or institutional purchasers in acquiring policies 
we purchased the bulk of the policies for our own account as part of settlement agreements or tertiary purchases  in which we acquired previously purchased policies because they were no longer suitable for the purchasers 
these were not opportunities offered to our retail or institutional purchasers and thus we were not competing with our purchasers 
in the fiscal years  and  we acquired interests in policies for our own account  all but one of which was a part of a settlement or a tertiary purchase 
in the fiscal years  and  we also invested in one institutional fund  for which we served as a purchasing agent 
the fund has completed its acquisitions of policies and is no longer purchasing 
we supplied approximately of the policies purchased by the fund  and its purchases from us were never more than of our revenues in any one year 
our compensation from the fund was less than the compensation we typically earned on retail purchases 
the life settlement market and competition 
life settlements provide a secondary market for existing life insurance policies that the owner no longer needs or wants and that insure a person whose life expectancy can be reasonably estimated 
from the early s through  the market for life settlements grew substantially from both the demand and the supply sides of the transaction with an increase in the average face amount of policies presented for sale 
the larger amount of capital required to meet the higher acquisition costs of the average life settlement led us to seek relationships with institutional purchasers in addition to expanding our base of retail clients and increasing the minimum investment amount 
we have devoted substantial marketing and client development resources to attracting both individual and institutional purchasers  both directly and through their advisors 
the number of retail purchasers and the amount of their average investment has increased over the last three fiscal years  providing us with a significant market advantage by enabling us to reach the diversification goals of our clients as well as giving us greater flexibility in purchasing policies 
institutional purchasers have played a less significant role in our business 
in the fiscal years  and  we had one institutional purchaser that accounted for   and of our revenues  respectively 
we believe that this market segment has potential  however  and continue to seek institutional opportunities 
in a report  the insurance research group  conning co 
the conning report  estimated that the life settlement industry completed billion in face value of transactions in and billion in based on our own research from other providers  publicly reported data and estimates based on historical data  we estimate the total amount of face value of transactions completed by the life settlement industry in was billion 
the conning report attributed the decline in market size from to to the disruption of the credit markets in as noted in the conning report  estimates of market size are only approximations  since precise market data is not available publicly 
we are the only publicly held company operating exclusively in this market 
some competitors file publicly available transaction activity with state insurance commissions 
however  not every company may report its transactions and the accuracy of the information relies on the veracity of the filings made by each company 
based on our estimate of a billion market in  our market share is approximately 
although the overall life settlement market contracted  which may be attributable to the distress of the credit markets  our business model does not use leverage and thus our market share grew from in to in as there was less competition for quality policies 
we believe the life settlement market is highly diversified among market participants 
we estimate that our largest industry competitor currently has about of the total market share 
excluding ourselves and this large competitor  the remaining of the market is divided among approximately other market participants  of which only five have between and each of the total market share 
unlike some of our competitors  which rely on the credit markets and may have more restrictive purchasing parameters or a single provider of investment capital  our retail oriented model has a broad base of over  clients 
we believe this diversified model makes us more competitive in the market and provides us with greater funding flexibility 
we also believe that this model provides a stronger platform for our sustainable growth as a company 
markets are segmented by length of life expectancy and policy face value 
the amount of competition in these markets varies according to the demand for such policies 
while we believe the life settlement market overall will remain flat or increase slightly during the next year  we believe our market share will continue to increase due to a number of factors 
first  market demand from our purchaser base remains strong for these transactions 
unlike much of our competition  we are not adversely affected by any restraint on credit 
the continued general economic uncertainty has led many purchasers to seek alternative investment strategies that diversify their portfolios and avoid economically sensitive investments 
life settlements provide diversification and produce returns that are not correlated to stock and bond market fluctuations  depressed real estate markets or the currently uncertain credit market 
we believe that interest from retail and institutional purchasers will grow throughout the next fiscal year 
a second contributing factor as to why we believe our share of the life settlement market may continue to increase is the solid supply of higher face value policies 
because of increased education among financial professionals and advisors  there is a growing awareness among policy owners of the value that can be realized from life settlements 
the growing awareness has expanded the supply of eligible policies  especially policies with higher face values 
we believe much of our increased business over the last three years is due to the steady supply of higher face value policies  and we believe this trend will continue 
we intend to increase our market share by growing our client base and utilizing our substantial intellectual capital and infrastructure to provide superior value to both policyholders and our clients 
among our core competencies is the ability to process and close transactions quickly and more efficiently than our competitors 
we believe our ability to deploy our assets into the market in this manner will enable us to continue to increase our market share 
limited access to capital  the insurance industry s addition of pre death cash benefits  law enforcement pressure on companies operating illegally  and increasing government regulation have contributed to a stabilization in the number and sophistication of life settlement companies  both those purchasing for their own accounts and those  like us  who act as agents for our clients 
we estimate the number of life settlement companies that are consistently active in purchasing for their own account or as agents for purchasers has declined to seven 
we believe this reduction in the number of competitors results from the withdrawal of companies that relied heavily on leverage and a single or preferred client model in the face of tightened credit markets 
in contrast  our business model uses no leverage and is a multi client model 
as credit markets tightened in and  the number of companies remaining in the market allowed us to see more policies and to be more selective in the policies we chose 
as a result  we were able to realize higher revenues per settlement policy in each of fiscal   and although we are one of the larger life settlement companies based on face value of policies settled  competition within the life settlement market is active among the few companies in this sector and we will continue to experience competition for qualified policies to purchase 
this competition will have an effect on the prices we pay for policies  the amount of brokerage and referral fees we pay  and the prices we set for the acquisition of policies 
we believe the overall market for life settlements will increase as more seniors become aware of their option to liquidate an unwanted policy through a life settlement 
in light of our experience in the market and our estimates concerning competition and supply and demand for policies  we believe our total business volume for life settlements will increase in fiscal the following table shows the number of life settlement contracts policies we have transacted  the aggregate face values and purchase prices of those contracts  and the revenues we derived  for our last three fiscal years fiscal fiscal fiscal number of settlements policies face value of policies average revenue per settlement total net revenues derived the revenues derived are exclusive of brokerage and referral fees 
industry regulation and taxation general 
when the life settlement market was first established  it was sparsely regulated 
due in part to well publicized abuses within the industry  the federal government and various states moved to regulate the market in the mid s 
these regulations generally took two forms 
one sought to apply consumer protection type regulations to the market 
this application was designed to protect policyholders and purchasers 
another sought to apply securities regulations to the market  in an effort to protect purchasers 
various states have also used their insurance regulations to guard against insurance fraud within the industry 
consumer protection licensing 
the consumer protection type regulations arose largely from the draft of a model law and regulations promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
at least states have now adopted some version of this model law or another form of regulation governing life settlement companies in some way 
these laws generally require the licensing of providers and brokers  require the filing and approval of settlement agreements and disclosure statements  describe the content of disclosures that must be made to insureds and sellers  describe various periodic reporting requirements for settlement companies and prohibit certain business practices deemed to be abusive 
some of these laws fix minimum payment levels that a purchaser must pay a selling insured based on the insured s life expectancy 
the minimum payment requirements generally apply when the insured is terminally ill or has a short life expectancy months or less 
in our settlement transactions  we typically deal with policies having life expectancies of months or longer and thus these requirements do not usually affect our settlement transactions 
licensing 
many states require the licensing of life settlement brokers and providers  mandate disclosures to sellers or purchasers or both  require periodic reporting requirements  and set forth prohibited business practices 
we are licensed as a viatical and life settlement company by the texas department of insurance 
under the texas requirements  we must file our transaction documents with the state for approval  make certain disclosures to insureds and sellers  offer a day right of rescission to the seller  file certain annual reports with the state  and abstain from unfair business practices 
because all of our transactions are completed in texas  the department of insurance has jurisdiction to investigate complaints from any insured or seller  regardless of the state in which that insured or seller lives 
consequently  we believe texas offers protection to all insureds or policyholders that we transact business with including those living in states that have no licensing requirement 
however  other states have their own licensing requirements in order to purchase policies from policy owners in those states and we comply with those requirements as well 
in addition to texas  we are licensed to engage in life settlement transactions with policy owners residing in the following states arkansas  connecticut  illinois  maryland  mississippi  nevada  new jersey  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  tennessee and virginia 
we also have a license application pending in the state of new york 
many other states have clearly identified exemptions from licensing requirements  which permit us to purchase from policy owners in those states according to those exemptions

securities regulations 
some states and the securities and exchange commission have attempted to treat life settlements as securities under federal or state securities laws 
we have structured our settlement transactions to reduce the risk that they would be treated as securities under state or federal securities law  and the federal circuit court for the district of columbia has ruled that our settlement transactions are not securities under the federal securities laws 
many state securities laws have exceptions or registration exemptions that may enable our settlement transactions in those states 
nonetheless  we have encountered claims from some states asserting that our transactions are securities under state law 
we have amicably settled these claims and have worked with regulators to establish clear guidelines for accepting clients from these states 
we believe that a combination of consumer protection type laws and existing insurance regulations provide an appropriate framework for regulation of the industry 
as a practical matter  the widespread application of securities laws would burden us and senior americans attempting to sell their policies with little or no benefit to purchasers 
each of our purchasers has represented themselves to be financially sophisticated  high net worth individuals or institutions  which have considerably less need for the protections afforded by the securities laws 
at this point  due to the manner in which we structure our settlements and the availability  in some instances  of exceptions and exemptions under securities laws  such laws have not limited our business model to a significant extent 
but we cannot give assurance that our business would not be materially and adversely impacted by securities based regulation 
insurance regulation 
as a life settlement company  we facilitate the transfer of ownership in life insurance policies  but do not participate in the issuance of policies 
further  we do not issue any type of contemporaneous agreement to purchase a policy at the time the policy is issued 
as such  we are not required to be licensed as an insurance company or insurance broker 
we do deal  however  with insurance companies and professionals in our business and are affected indirectly by the regulations covering them 
the insurance industry is highly regulated  and these regulations affect us in numerous ways 
we must understand the regulations as they apply to policy terms and provisions and the entitlement to  and collectability of  policy benefits 
we rely upon the protections against fraudulent conduct that these regulations offer  and we rely upon the licensing of companies and individuals with whom we do business 
employees as of february   we had direct employees  none of whom are represented by a labor union  as well as  licensees who act as independent contractors and refer clients to us for the purchase of life settlements 
we continuously review benefits and other matters of interest to our employees and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

item a 
risk factors in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business 
such factors significantly affect or could significantly affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that have been made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
growth in the life settlement market may be affected by several factors growth of the life settlement market and our expansion within the market may be affected by a variety of factors  including the inability to identify sufficient numbers of qualified policies to meet demand  the inability to convince potential sellers of the benefits of life settlements  the inability to attract sufficient qualified purchasers  competition from other life settlement companies  the occurrence of illegal or abusive business practices resulting in negative publicity about the market  and the adoption of overly burdensome governmental regulation 
in addition  the life settlement market may evolve in ways we have not anticipated and we may be unable to respond in a timely or cost effective manner 
if the life settlement market fails to grow as quickly as or in the directions we have anticipated  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected as it relates to our large scale growth 
our success depends on maintaining relationships within our referral networks we rely primarily upon brokers to refer potential sellers of policies to us and upon financial professionals  known as licensees  to refer retail purchasers to us 
these relationships are essential to our operations and we must maintain these relationships to be successful 
we do not have fixed contractual arrangements with life settlement brokers and they are free to do business with our competitors 
our network of licensees is much broader  but no less important 
our ability to build and maintain relationships with our licensees will depend upon our closing rates  the value we bring to our retail clients and the level of compensation we pay to the referring professional 
the compensation paid to the referring professional will affect the offer price to the seller and the compensation we receive 
we must balance these interests successfully to build our referring network and attain greater profitability 
our purchasers depend on our ability to predict life expectancies and set appropriate prices  if our investment returns are not competitive  we may lose purchasers a purchaser s investment return from a life settlement depends on three factors the difference between the policy face amount and purchaser s cost basis consisting of the acquisition cost and premiums paid to maintain the policy  the length of the holding period  and the demise of the insured 
we price settlements based on the policy face amount  the anticipated life expectancy of an insured and policy maintenance costs 
life expectancies are estimated generally from standard medical and actuarial data based on the historical experiences of similarly situated persons 
the data is based necessarily on averages involving mortality and morbidity statistics 
the outcome of a single settlement may vary significantly from the statistical average 
it is impossible to predict any one insured s life expectancy exactly 
to mitigate the risk that an insured will outlive his or her predicted life expectancy  we price life settlements to yield competitive returns even if this life expectancy prediction is exceeded by several years 
in addition  life settlement purchasers must be able to bear a non liquid investment for an indeterminate period 
if we underestimate the average life expectancies and price our transactions too high  our purchasers will realize smaller returns  demand may fall  and purchasers may invest their funds elsewhere 
in addition  amounts escrowed for premiums may be insufficient to keep the policy in force  requiring purchasers to invest further proceeds to pay these additional premiums 
if we overestimate the average life expectancies  the settlement prices we offer will fall below market levels  supply will decrease  and sellers may engage in business with our competitors or pursue other alternatives 
our ability to accurately predict life expectancies and price accordingly is affected by a number of factors  including the accuracy of our life expectancy estimations  which must sufficiently account for factors including an insured s age  medical condition  life habits such as smoking  and geographic location  our ability to anticipate and adjust for trends  such as advances in medical treatments  that affect life expectancy data  and our ability to balance competing interests when pricing settlements  such as the amounts paid to policy sellers  the acquisition costs paid by purchasers  and the compensation paid to ourselves and our referral networks 
to support our pricing systems  we use both in house and outside specialists  including medical doctors and published actuarial data 
we cannot assure purchasers that  despite our experience in settlement pricing  we will not err by underestimating or overestimating average life expectancies or miscalculating reserve amounts for future premiums 
if we do so  we could lose purchasers or policy sellers  and those losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
government regulation could negatively impact our business we are licensed and regulated by the texas department of insurance as a viatical and life settlement company and hold licenses as a life settlement provider in other states as well 
state laws requiring the licensing of life settlement providers govern many aspects of our conduct  operations  advertising and disclosures 
the laws may vary from state to state  however  and our activities and those of brokers with whom we do business can be affected by changes in these laws or different interpretations of these laws 
in addition  some states and the securities and exchange commission treat certain life settlements as securities under state and federal securities laws 
we have legal precedent holding that our settlements are not securities under the federal securities laws 
possible exceptions or registration exemptions may be available to us under many state securities laws 
as a result  we do not believe that the application of state or federal securities laws will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
nonetheless  we have encountered claims from states that our transactions are securities under state law and subject to registration 
we have settled all of these claims amicably and with clear direction as to how we may accept clients from these states 
however  we cannot assure you that other securities regulators or private individuals will not attempt to apply the securities laws to our settlements or that defending such attempts would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  changes in laws or governmental regulation could affect our brokers or clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our chairman and chief executive officer beneficially owns of our common stock and  as a result  can exercise significant influence over us under sec regulations  mr 
brian d 
pardo  our chairman and chief executive officer  is considered the beneficial owner of approximately of our common stock  largely as the result of exercising voting power by proxy over shares held by the pardo family trust 
he will be able to control most matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
his voting control affects indirectly the process for nominating directors  since theoretically he could nominate and elect directors without board involvement 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of life partners  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we have not received within days before february   written comments from the securities and exchange commission regarding our periodic or current reports under the securities and exchange act of  as amended  that remain unresolved 
item properties our corporate offices are located at woodhew drive in waco  texas 
we own two buildings on adjacent lots at this location and our offices occupy both buildings  which together total  square feet 
one building was built in and the other in item legal proceedings during the fiscal years ended february    and february   we incurred settlement expenses of   and  respectively  for the resolution of litigation or potential litigation 
in fiscal  the biggest settlements were for the maxim and state of texas cases discussed below 
we also settled a case in florida for  in some instances  we have repurchased interests in policies to settle claims 
in these cases  only the excess if any of the settlement payment over the investment cost of the repurchased policy interest is charged to settlement expense 
the balance is recorded on our balance sheet as an asset under investments in policies and the cash expenditure is recorded on our cash flow statement under purchase of policies for investment purposes and capitalized premiums 
on april   we entered into a settlement agreement with maxim group  llc  an investment firm  to settle all claims in a civil action filed in under the settlement  we agreed to deliver to maxim  shares of our common stock  which were held in treasury  and which were valued for settlement purposes at million per share 
the fairness of this share delivery was affirmed by the court in a fairness hearing  which was conducted on april  the court s affirmation enabled the shares to qualify for exemption from registration under section a of the securities act of  as amended 
the cost of settlement was accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of february  the settlement cost had no effect on our cash position as of february  the delivered treasury shares will be shown as issued and outstanding in the fiscal quarter ending may  on april   the state of texas initiated a suit against lpi for alleged violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act dtpa 
the state claimed that the contracts lpi used with purchasers before did not clearly state that the purchasers were responsible for paying premiums to keep life insurance policies purchased in force and that lpi had violated the dtpa by requesting premiums from purchasers 
lpi contended that the purchasers of the policy interests were responsible to pay premiums  as they were the owners of the policies 
the trial court issued a summary judgment in favor of lpi  which was appealed by the state 
after a lengthy appeals process  the matter was remanded back to the trial court and the lpi and the state agreed to settle the matter by entering into an assurance of voluntary compliance avc agreement  which was filed with the court on april  under the avc  both parties stipulate that the action relates only to certain contracts used with texas purchasers before the avc further stipulates that the attorney general did not allege that lpi miscalculated escrow accounts or that it committed any crime  fraud  misappropriation or malfeasance regarding escrow accounts 
under the terms of the avc  lpi agrees not to request any further premium payments from the texas purchasers identified in the avc  to pay future premiums on their behalf  estimated at  annually  and to pay settlement costs totaling  by entering into the avc  both parties agree to release and discharge each other from any and all claims for damages or other relief arising out of the action and we consider this matter to be completely resolved and settled 
on may   we settled an administrative case with the virginia state corporation commission  which provides for a safe harbor of procedures and disclosures that will permit us to accept virginia residents as purchasers within a clearly defined regulatory structure 
the estimated cost of this settlement of  was accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of february  we are subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  we reserve for such losses 
except as discussed above i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of our pending litigation  ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any pending litigation  and iii accordingly  management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of any pending litigation 
nevertheless  although litigation is subject to uncertainty  management believes and we have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that we have a number of valid claims and defenses in all pending litigation to which we are a party  as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against us 
all such cases are  and will continue to be  vigorously defended and all valid counterclaims pursued 
however  we may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders to do so 
part ii item market for our common stock  related shareholder matters and our purchases of our equity securities market information our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol lphi 
on april   there were approximately shareholders of record of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
we provide the following discussion to assist in understanding our financial position as of february   and results of operations for the years ended february    and february  as you read this discussion  refer to our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the material line items of these statements 
critical accounting estimates  assumptions and policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to guide our preparation  we follow accounting policies  some of which represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
certain accounting estimates involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period that management considers to be critical accounting estimates 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  management s experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results may differ materially from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
areas affected by our estimates and assumptions are identified below 
we recognize income at the time a settlement closes and the purchaser has obligated itself to make the purchase 
we defer per life settlement to cover minor monitoring services provided subsequent to the settlement date 
we amortize this deferred cost over the anticipated life expectancy of the insureds 
we sometimes make short term advances to facilitate a life settlement transaction 
these amounts are included in accounts receivable trade  and are collected as the life settlement transactions close 
all amounts are considered collectible as we are repaid the advance before any of the other parties involved in the transaction receive funds 
we follow the guidance contained in asc  investments in insurance contracts  to account for our investments in life settlement contracts 
asc states that a purchaser may elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts using either the investment method or the fair value method 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
under the investment method  a purchaser recognizes the initial investment at the purchase price plus all initial direct costs 
continuing costs eg  policy premiums and direct external costs  if any to keep the policy in force are capitalized 
under the fair value method  a purchaser recognizes the initial investment at the purchase price 
in subsequent periods  the purchaser re measures the investment at fair value in its entirety at each reporting period and recognizes changes in fair value earnings or other performance indicators for entities that do not report earnings in the period in which the changes occur 
we elected to value our investments in life settlement contracts using the investment method 
as of february   our investments in life settlements held for our own account were carried at  we establish litigation and policy analysis loss accruals based on our best estimates as to the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities 
this loss analysis is necessary to properly match current expenses to currently recognized revenues and to recognize that there is a certain amount of liability associated with litigation and policy losses 
through these accruals  we recognize the estimated cost to settle pending litigation as an expense 
these estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted to management s best estimate of the anticipated liability on a case by case basis 
a high degree of judgment is required in determining these estimated accrual amounts since the outcomes are affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  there is a risk that the estimates of future litigation and policy analysis loss costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
any difference between estimates and actual final outcomes could have a material impact on our financial statements 
we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts and notes receivable and premium advances 
the accounts associated with these areas are critical to recognizing the correct amount of revenue and expenses in the proper period 
within the last quarter of fiscal  issues have been resolved which have enabled us to better estimate the collectability of premium advances 
the agreement with the state of texas allowed us to specifically identify a class of investors for whom we made premium advances  and which  under the terms of the agreement  will be uncollectible 
our historical success of collecting premium advances has enabled us to build a body of evidence by which we can demonstrate full collectability of the remaining balance of advanced premiums 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment includes current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the property is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
based on this assessment  there was no impairment during fiscal years  and we must evaluate the useful lives of our property and equipment to assure that an adequate amount of depreciation is being charged to operations 
useful lives are based generally on specific knowledge of an asset s life in combination with the internal revenue service rules and guidelines for depreciable lives for specific types of assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include a tax provision or reduce our tax benefit in the statements of income 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary 
we have not made any material changes to our critical accounting estimates or assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of those estimates or assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those policies that are not critical  in note of our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements have been issued including asc       and asc asu 
for a discussion of these pronouncements  refer to footnote of our consolidated financial statements 
life partners we are the world s oldest and only publicly traded company operating exclusively in the life settlement industry 
our revenues are primarily derived from fees associated with facilitating life settlement transactions 
comparison of years ended february    and february  we had net income of  for the year ended february  fiscal  compared to net income of  for the year ended february  fiscal  and  for the year ended february  fiscal 
the increase in net income in fiscal is attributable primarily to a increase in revenues and our ability to increase our operating margins by remaining highly selective in our purchasing strategies  resulting in a increase in revenues net of brokerage and licensee fees 
the increase in revenues  net of brokerage fees  together with the large decrease in the allowance account for premium advances  resulted in an increase in income from operations of 
the increase in net income in fiscal was attributable to a increase in revenues and a increase in revenues net of brokerage and licensee fees 
the large increase in revenues  net of brokerage fees  resulted in an increase in income from operations of 
legal and professional costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  and after executive and employee bonuses and payroll  comprised the largest single general and administrative expense 
the legal and professional costs were attributable primarily to legal costs associated with the administrative case by the state of virginia  our audit and tax preparation fees  our sec filings  the lawsuit with the state of texas  defending ourselves in the arbitration against a former investment banking firm  and other legal matters as they arise 
see item  legal proceedings 
revenues revenues increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increased number of settlements  from in fiscal to in fiscal there was also a increase in the average revenue per settlement  increasing from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as we continued our trend of brokering larger face value policies at higher margins 
our revenues increased at a slower rate than in previous years as institutional sales declined  leaving retail sales as our primary source of revenue 
revenues increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal while the number of settlements we transacted in fiscal decreased by from fiscal  from to  our average revenue per settlement increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in revenue per settlement resulted from brokering larger face value policies 
during the periods  despite the global economic recession  demand for our services remained strong and the number of policies presented to us and meeting our purchasing qualifications remained constant 
we continue to see a supply of policies with higher face values that meet our purchasing parameters and we anticipate this supply trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
most of our competitors have adopted a single or preferred client business model  which relies on a relatively narrow purchaser base 
in contrast  we employ a broad based  multi client business model and our purchaser base is much broader 
while a single purchaser may account for a substantial share of revenues during a particular quarterly period  we do not intend to become reliant upon any single purchaser and expect that no single purchaser will account for a substantial share of revenues during the long term 
we believe this business model will permit us to achieve sustainable growth for the foreseeable future  without the risks associated with a single or limited number of clients 
we believe the increasing demand for our services results from several factors  one of which is an investment trend toward diversifying investment portfolios and avoiding economically sensitive investments 
returns on life settlements are linked to the lives of the insureds 
as such  settlements function independently from  and are not correlated to  traditional equity and debt markets and commodity investments 
we benefit from the investment community searching for returns higher than what is currently available in the traditional marketplace 
although we serve both domestic and foreign purchasers  domestic purchasers accounted for approximately of our business in fiscal in fiscal years and  the ratio was approximately domestic and foreign 
this decline is due to a large foreign institution reducing its purchases of life settlements 
another contributing factor has been the greater supply of higher face value policies 
we believe there is a growing awareness of the secondary market for insurance policies among potential sellers  especially for those with higher face value policies 
this growing awareness has resulted in an expansion of the supply of eligible policies  in particular higher face value policies 
we believe much of our increased business is due to the greater supply of higher face value policies  and we believe this trend will continue 
brokerage and referral fees brokerage and referral fees increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal brokerage and referral fees increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal brokerage and referral fees constituted of revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal due to an increase in the number of brokers in the market that are presenting policies to us  we have noted a substantial reduction in the concentration of brokers that provide policies 
in fiscal  and  broker referrals accounted for of the total face value of policies transacted 
policies presented from one broker represented more than of all completed transactions in fiscal  at 
in fiscal  policies presented from three brokers who each represented more than of all completed transactions totaled of the total face value 
in fiscal  policies presented from three brokers who each represented more than of all completed transactions totaled of the total face value 
brokerage and referral fees generally increase or decrease with revenues  face values of policies transacted and the volume of transactions  although the exact ratio may vary according to a number of factors 
brokers may adjust their fees with the individual policyholders whom they represent 
in some instances  several brokers may compete for representation of the same seller  which will result in lower broker fees 
referral fees also vary depending on factors such as varying contractual obligations  market demand for a particular kind of policy or life expectancy category and individual agreements between clients and their referring financial planners 
no broker fees are paid when a policy owner is not represented by a broker and presents a policy to us directly 
many states now license life settlement brokerage activity  which may result in the capping of fees or the increased disclosure of fees  either of which would tend to lower the fees 
operating expense general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal premium advances in fiscal were a negative  as the allowance account for premium advances was reduced 
premium advances  net of reimbursements  were  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
executive and employee bonuses increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal executive and employee bonuses increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal increased payments in both years are a direct result of our increased profitability  which is linked to executive compensation plans and bonuses given to all employees 
also included in fiscal general and administrative expenses are legal and professional expenses of  primarily associated with legal actions with the states of colorado  virginia  florida and texas  and in defending ourselves in the m 
smith and maxim cases 
this compares favorably with legal and professional expenses  in fiscal and  in fiscal we have settled all material actions and believe our legal and professional expenses will further decline in fiscal see item  legal proceedings 
for various legal actions or claims in which we believe we might incur liability  we paid non recurring settlement expenses of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal a significant portion of the settlement expense was the result of settlements with maxim for  of treasury stock and the state of florida for  we make advances on policy premiums to maintain certain policies 
in the typical life settlement  policy premiums for the insured s projected life expectancy are added to the purchase price and those future premium amounts are set aside in an escrow account to pay future premiums 
when the future premium amounts are exhausted  purchasers are contractually obligated to pay the additional policy premiums 
in some instances  purchasers have failed to pay the premiums and we have repurchased the policy or advanced the premiums to maintain the policies 
while we have no contractual or other legal obligation to do so  and do not do so in every instance  we have made premium advances as an accommodation to certain purchasers based on our assumptions that we will ultimately recoup the advances 
while some purchasers repay the advances directly  reimbursements of these premiums will come most likely as a priority payment from the policy proceeds when an insured dies 
we must make estimates of the collectability of these premium advances 
we recorded an allowance against the premium advances at the time of the advance and treated reimbursements as a reduction of the allowance 
until fiscal  due to the uncertainty of the outcome of a relevant court case  we were unable to estimate the amount of any future advances we may elect to make or the timing of the amount of reimbursements we were likely to receive 
within fiscal  issues were resolved which enabled us to better estimate the collectability of premium advances 
the agreement with the state of texas allowed us to specifically identify a class of investors for whom we made premium advances  and which  under the terms of the agreement  will be uncollectible 
our historical success of collecting premium advances has enabled us to build a body of evidence by which we can demonstrate full collectability of the remaining balance of advanced premiums 
to date  we have ultimately been fully reimbursed when we have made an advance and the policy has matured 
as a result  we eliminated million of the allowance on the advanced premiums account in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  and  we made premium advances of   and  respectively  and were reimbursed   and  respectively 
the advances less the reimbursements for periods before fiscal are included as a net expense within operating expenses 
interest income and expense net interest income and expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal the increase in interest income in fiscal corresponded to higher investment balances  as well as maturities on owned policies 
the decrease in net interest income in was a result of lower market interest rates on investments 
there were several maturities on policies  gains and distributions from our investment in the life settlements trust in fiscal the gain from our investment in fiscal was  interest expense declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal to  in fiscal interest expense related primarily to the long term debt financing on our property  which was retired on april  realized loss on investments we realized a loss of  on investment securities in fiscal  compared to none in fiscal and  in fiscal the tax effect for the year ended february   was calculated assuming that the long term capital loss deduction for tax purposes would be reduced by any long term capital gains we are able to net against by carrying back or carrying forward the loss to past and future tax returns 
as of february   we have no certain future capital gains  therefore  the net tax effect for the year ended february   is only what we will be able to carry back  or  the loss in fiscal was a result of our conclusion that the unrealized loss in fair value of our investment securities was no longer temporary 
the decline in fair value of securities in previous periods was not recognized for financial reporting purposes  as the loss was considered temporary in nature 
the unrealized loss in previous periods was included in other comprehensive loss within the equity section of the balance sheet 
income taxes income tax expense increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal income tax expense in fiscal increased significantly due to increased pre tax earnings  taxed at  and the accrual of  of texas margin tax   for an estimated assessment due to non deductibility of certain payments in past and current periods  included in our calculation of the texas margin  and  for the current year ended february   due in may of income tax expense was also affected by the impact of establishing a  allowance within the deferred income tax asset account 
this allowance was established to recognize the uncertainty of netting future capital gains against a current capital loss 
income tax expense increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal increased income tax in fiscal is a direct result of the increase in pre tax earnings 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities declined by  decreasing  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal net cash flows provided by operating activities increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal net cash flows provided by operating activities in all years resulted primarily from net income 
fiscal s cash flow was decreased primarily by a decrease in the advanced premiums allowance account and an increase in accounts receivable  and increased primarily by an increase in accrued liabilities 
fiscal s cash flow was increased primarily by a decrease in accounts receivable and decreased by a decline in accounts payable 
fiscal s cash flow was decreased primarily by an increase in accounts receivable and increased by an increase in accounts payable 
investing and financing activities we used cash of  in investing activities in fiscal versus  in fiscal and  in fiscal as our net income has increased and our financial condition has strengthened  we have used some of these earnings to purchase policy interests for our own account 
we purchased policies of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal of the policies purchased in fiscal and   and  respectively  represented policies that we acquired in connection with a settlement with the state of colorado 
the terms of the settlement afforded us the opportunity to purchase a large number of policy interests from existing clients on terms that provided value to us as well as our clients 
we completed the purchase of these policies in our first quarter of fiscal  which ended may  we have continued to acquire policy interests on a discretionary basis as those opportunities are presented to us by existing clients and on terms that are agreeable to both parties 
we believe that we will profit from the investment in these policies when they mature 
in fiscal  we invested  in a life settlements trust  which acquired life settlement interests 
our investment followed an earlier investment of  in the life settlements trust in fiscal in addition to investing  we acted as a non exclusive purchasing agent for the trust and its predecessor partnership 
the trust is no longer acquiring life settlements and we do not anticipate further investments 
the trust owns a portfolio of life insurance settlements with an initial face value of million  which we anticipate will mature over the next few years 
the trust has experienced some maturities during the course of fiscal and we have been paid from these maturities 
cash proceeds from the maturities were  in fiscal  we made purchases of property and equipment of  while in fiscal we made purchases of  and in fiscal purchases of  the purchases of property and equipment in were primarily the purchase of land and building adjacent to our corporate headquarters and an airplane  which was also sold in fiscal investments in certificates of deposit were zero in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal maturities of certificates of deposit were  in fiscal  while it was zero in both fiscal years and investment purchases in marketable securities were zero in   in fiscal and  in fiscal we used  in financing activities in fiscal versus  in fiscal and  in fiscal we paid dividends of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we paid off our long term debt in fiscal at a cost of  payments on the line of credit and long term debt in fiscal and were  and  respectively 
we received proceeds from loans of zero in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we made no treasury share purchases in fiscal we purchased shares on the open market treasury shares for  in fiscal and  in fiscal working capital and capital availability as of february   we had working capital of  our cash during fiscal increased by  compared with an increase of  in fiscal and an increase of  in fiscal in the event we required credit to facilitate our short term cash flow management and operating capital requirements  we maintained two credit lines 
one credit line was secured by cash and securities on deposit 
as of february   it carried an interest rate at the wall street journal prime rate of and had a borrowing base of million 
there was no outstanding balance on this line of credit as of february  and this line of credit was discontinued in march the other line of credit was secured by a certificate of deposit 
this line of credit carried an interest rate of and had a borrowing base of million 
there was no outstanding balance on this line as of february  or this line was no longer available when the collateralized certificate of deposit matured in fiscal we believe future income from operating activities will generate sufficient profits and cash flows to meet our anticipated working capital needs in both the long and short term 
in addition  we continue to explore the formation of life settlement investment funds  whether sponsored externally or internally  and other types of financing opportunities  which will provide more funds for life settlement transactions 
we pursue these opportunities believing that the funds will expand our retail efforts by affording purchasers an alternative to the current retail model in which purchasers acquire direct interests in policies 
we believe that securities brokers are accustomed to seeing investment products in a fund structure and their familiarity with fund structures may increase broker interest 
we also believe the fund structure will aid market penetration by enabling us to sell in states that treat life settlements as securities  which limits or blocks our ability to sell in those states 
our financial strategy is to increase cash flows generated from operations by increasing revenues while controlling brokerage and general and administrative expenses 
we believe that demand for life settlements will continue to grow during the next year as the prospects for economic conditions remain uncertain  as the popularity of non correlated assets continues to grow  and as we gain competitive advantage in a growing market 
in addition to our traditional retail base  we have expanded our services to accommodate institutional purchasers 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements or transactions
