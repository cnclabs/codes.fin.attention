table of contents part i item business allied nevada gold corp 
is primarily a gold producer which operates the hycroft mine and has a large number of prospective exploration claims in the state of nevada 
at may   allied nevada had proven and probable mineral reserves of million ounces of gold and an aggregate land position of approximately square miles square kilometers 
assuming current life of mine plans  it is estimated that the proven and probable reserves would be mined and processed for approximately five years 
allied nevada s corporate headquarters is located at gateway drive  suite  reno  nevada in this report  allied nevada  the company  our and we refer to allied nevada gold corp and or our affiliates and subsidiaries 
formation of allied nevada initial corporate organization allied nevada gold corp 
commenced operations in may we were incorporated under the laws of delaware on september  and until may  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of vista gold corp 
vista  a corporation incorporated under the laws of the yukon territory  canada 
we commenced our operations on may   following vista s transfer to us of its nevada based mining properties and related assets  along with cash  and the transfer to us by carl pescio and janet pescio the pescios of their interests in certain nevada mining properties and related assets 
in this document  we sometimes use the terms vista nevada assets and pescio nevada assets to refer to  respectively  vista s nevada based mining properties and related assets  and the pescios interests in certain nevada mining properties and related assets that were transferred to us pursuant to the arrangement agreement that we entered into with vista and the pescios on september   as amended 
before the arrangement agreement transactions were completed  we had no properties or property interests  were not yet conducting business operations and had no shareholders other than vista 
the new common shares of vista and the shares of allied nevada common stock began trading on may   on the nyse amex  and the toronto stock exchange tsx 
in july  allied nevada completed a private placement for gross proceeds of cdn  we issued  units consisting of one common share and common share purchase warrant 
the proceeds of the private placement were for the exploration and development of the hycroft mine and for general corporate purposes 
in september  the board of directors approved the re opening of the hycroft mine hycroft development program 
the hycroft development program involved re opening the hycroft mine and heap leach facilities which had been placed on a care and maintenance program due to low gold prices since in april  we completed a financing and issued  common shares for gross proceeds of cdn  proceeds from the financing were to fund the reactivation of the hycroft mine and to continue oxide and sulphide exploration activities at hycroft 
in december  initial production was achieved at the hycroft mine with  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver produced 
in august  we completed a cross border financing and issued  common shares for gross proceeds of cdn  proceeds from the financing were to fund an expanded oxide and sulphide exploration program at hycroft and general corporate purposes 
segment information we have operating segments of hycroft mine  exploration properties  and other 
the hycroft mine operating segment contains the exploration and operational activities at our wholly owned hycroft mine located in nevada 
the exploration properties segment contains the exploration and development activities on the remaining mineral properties owned by the company 
the other operating segment primarily contains the corporate overhead functions of the company 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements for information related to our business segments 
general description of the business of allied nevada allied nevada owns the hycroft mine  the maverick springs a joint venture with silver standard resources inc silver standard  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills and wildcat projects  the contact and other nevada properties previously owned by vista  the pony creek elliot dome property package and the exploration rights to more than a hundred other earlier stage exploration properties 
see part i item properties 
all of these properties are located in the state of nevada 

table of contents we operate the wholly owned hycroft mine  which is located miles west of winnemucca  nevada 
the hycroft mine is an open pit  heap leach gold mine that is expected to produce silver as a byproduct of the gold recovery process 
all currently identified ore reserves will be mined by open pit methods with a typical drill  blast  load  and haul cycle from two pits  the brimstone pit and the cut pit 
presently  all ore grade material placed on the leach pad will be run of mine 
in  the mine will integrate a crushing system capable of crushing  tonnes of ore per day 
ore will be selectively crushed based on ore type and grade 
once this system is in place  both crushed ore and run of mine ore will be placed on the leach pad 
the pregnant solution will be processed using a carbon in leach solution recovery process cil process and a merrill crowe zinc precipitation process merrill crowe process 
based on current operating performance and life of mine plans  management believes the hycroft mine has achieved full production capacity and expects annual gold production to be approximately  ounces in management also believes that the mining of the current proven and probable reserves will permit the company to produce gold at these production levels for each of the next five years 
management intends to continue its oxide exploration program with the objective of identifying additional proven and probable reserves that can extend the current mine life 
management also intends to continue its exploration of the sulphide mineralization and its economic evaluation of the feasibility of bringing a sulphide mine into production 
please refer to item properties and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information 
in addition to operating the hycroft mine  allied nevada is engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and development projects in the state of nevada 
management continues to seek opportunities to improve the value of the gold projects that we own or control through exploration drilling  introducing technological innovations  potential joint venture partners and developing properties into operating mines 
we expect that emphasis on gold project acquisition and development will continue in the future 
principal products allied nevada sold  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver during we generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer 
we recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable  the gold has been delivered  the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
most of our revenue will come from the sale of refined gold in the international market 
the end product at our gold operations  however  is generally dor bars 
dor is an alloy consisting of gold  silver and other metals 
dor is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of pure gold 
under the terms of our refining agreements  the dor bars are refined for a fee  and our share of the refined gold and the separately recovered silver are credited to our account or delivered to our buyers 
during  our gold revenues were more than times our silver revenues 
as such  we consider gold to be a principal product and silver to be a byproduct of the gold recovery process 
gold uses 
gold has two main categories of use fabrication and investment 
fabricated gold has a variety of end uses  including jewelry  electronics  dentistry  industrial and decorative uses  medals  medallions and official coins 
gold investors buy gold bullion  official coins and jewelry 
gold supply 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and the draw down of existing stocks of gold held by governments  financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
based on public information available for the years through  current mine production has  on average  accounted for approximately of the annual supply of gold 
for the first nine months of  mine supply had diminished to approximately as the gold price reached record highs and individuals were persuaded to monetize their physical gold holdings such as jewelry and coins increasing old gold scrap supply

table of contents on march   the afternoon fixing price for gold on the london bullion market was  per ounce 
business strategy our business plan was developed with the overriding goal of maximizing shareholder value through the operation of the hycroft mine  the exploration and development of our mineral properties  and through strategic partnerships 
to achieve this goal  our business plan focuses on three strategic areas hycroft mine mine operations hycroft exploration drilling program exploration properties mergers and acquisitions hycroft mine mine operations the hycroft mine is located miles west of winnemucca  nevada along the border of humboldt and pershing counties  and covers approximately  acres of mineral rights 
during  allied nevada completed its first full year of mining operations at hycroft 
the mine encountered some short term challenges during the commissioning phase in  which were corrected by year end these challenges stemmed from a delay in operating the newly constructed areas of leach pad expansion as well as a much higher cyanide consumption than anticipated during the fourth quarter of based on current life of mine plans  management believes as of december   that hycroft has achieved a steady state production rate and expects to produce  ounces of gold in the mine completed a million square foot expansion to its brimstone leach pad in and construction of a refinery 
at full production  based upon our current assumptions and life of mine plan  the mine is expected to employ workers and will mine approximately million tonnes of material per annum 
management is currently reviewing options to expand oxide gold production 
mining is being accomplished with open pit mining methods and the run of mine heap leach process is being used to recover gold from the ore 
silver is produced as a byproduct of the gold extraction process 
solution from the heap leach process is further processed using cil and merrill crowe process methods 
the final product of this process is a dor which contains gold and silver precious metals 
the dor is refined by a third party refinery which produces gold and silver bullions 
our operating objective at the hycroft mine is to mine the deposit in a profitable  safe  and environmentally friendly manner 
to attain this goal  we have focused on recruiting and retaining experienced executives  managers  and employees 
the team that has been formed by allied nevada has extensive specific experience in managing and operating mines utilizing the specific mining and processing methods used by the company 
this team has identified the appropriate technologies and developed the appropriate production management  health and safety programs and environmental management  monitoring  and protection programs 
see part i item properties operating properties hycroft mine mine operations 
hycroft exploration drilling program increase of oxide reserves in  allied nevada completed the first phase of an in fill program designed to improve the confidence level of other mineralized material and upgrade a portion of that material to the proven and probable reserve categories 
an updated reserve calculation is expected to be completed in the second quarter of testing of sulphide gold and silver mineralization the second objective of the hycroft exploration drilling program is to continue testing the economic viability of the sulphide gold and silver mineralization on the hycroft property 
during  an exploration campaign was completed designed to collect samples for ongoing metallurgical work and gain data in preparation of a feasibility study for sulphide mineralization 
results of this exploration campaign are expected to be released in the second quarter of three phases of metallurgical work have been completed in with encouraging results to date 
any expansion of the hycroft mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan  will require us to obtain all permits  approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in nevada 
for further discussions concerning these programs  see part i item properties operating properties hycroft mine hycroft mine exploration 

table of contents exploration properties our exploration properties portfolio consists of six advanced properties in maverick springs joint venture interest with silver standard  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills  wildcat  and pony creek elliot dome and more than earlier stage exploration properties 
evaluation of these properties is ongoing to determine each property s economic potential including some drilling and geophysical testing on three of the advanced exploration properties and surface exploration on eight other exploration properties 
these programs are success driven and  based on initial results  we may develop exploration programs  enter into joint venture exploration agreements  sell or dispose of these properties 
for further discussions concerning our exploration properties  please see information concerning each property under part i item properties 
mergers and acquisitions we routinely review merger and acquisition opportunities 
our primary focus will be on those opportunities involving precious metal production or near term production with a secondary focus on other resource based opportunities 
potential acquisition targets would include private and public companies or individual properties 
although our preference would be for acquisition candidates located in the united states  allied nevada will consider opportunities located in other countries where the geopolitical risk is acceptably low 
financial information included in this document this annual report on form k includes financial and other information for the years ended december  prior to may   we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of vista 
consistent with our past filings  the financial statements  related discussion and analysis and other financial information in this document were prepared as relates to the subsidiaries of vista that held nevada based mining properties and related assets that were transferred to allied nevada as part of the arrangement agreement

competition allied nevada competes with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold properties 
there is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition opportunities  some of which is with companies having substantially greater financial resources than allied nevada 
as a result  allied nevada may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices 
allied nevada also competes with other mining companies for skilled employees and from time to time certain production inputs have been in short supply 
when shortages of production supplies occur  this would rarely lead to serious issues for the operation  but would require us to either substitute with lower quality supplies or to ship these supplies from longer distances 
these substitutions and changes would therefore result in minor production inefficiencies or additional costs 
we have not experienced any material shortages in production inputs of this nature 
management of allied nevada believes that no single company has sufficient market power to affect the price or supply of gold in the world market 
allied nevada does not have any major customers for its gold production that would adversely affect the company should they fail

table of contents government regulation of mining related activities property interests and mining claims our exploration activities are conducted in the state of nevada 
mineral interests may be owned in nevada by a the united states  b the state itself  or c private parties 
where prospective mineral properties are owned by private parties  or by the state  some type of property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for allied nevada to explore or develop such property 
generally  these agreements take the form of long term mineral leases under which we acquire the right to explore and develop the property in exchange for periodic cash payments during the exploration and development phase and a royalty  usually expressed as a percentage of gross production or net profits derived from the leased properties if and when mines on the properties are brought into production 
other forms of acquisition agreements are exploration agreements coupled with options to purchase and joint venture agreements 
where prospective mineral properties are held by the united states  mineral rights may be acquired through the location of unpatented mineral claims upon unappropriated federal land 
if the statutory requirements for the location of a mining claim are met  the locator obtains a valid possessory right to develop and produce minerals from the claim 
the right can be freely transferred and  provided that the locator is able to prove the discovery of locatable minerals on the claims  is protected against appropriation by the government without just compensation 
the claim locator also acquires the right to obtain a patent or fee title to his claim from the federal government upon compliance with certain additional procedures note since october  the us bureau of land management blm has been prohibited by acts of congress from accepting any new mineral patent applications mining claims are subject to the same risk of defective title that is common to all real property interests 
additionally  mining claims are self initiated and self maintained and therefore  possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests 
it is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims solely from an examination of the public real estate records and  therefore  it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim 
if the validity of a patented mining claim is challenged by the blm or the us forest service on the grounds that mineralization has not been demonstrated  the claimant has the burden of proving the present economic feasibility of mining minerals located thereon 
such a challenge might be raised when a patent application is submitted or when the government seeks to include the land in an area to be dedicated to another use 
reclamation we generally are required to mitigate long term environmental impacts by stabilizing  contouring  resloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed 
these reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans  which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
allied nevada s principal reclamation liability is at the hycroft mine 
at december   we have posted reclamation bonds totaling million 
these reclamation bonds are supported by an insurance backed financial assurance program and a surety bond 
please see note restricted cash to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
in january  allied nevada increased its total reclamation bonding to million to cover the increased reclamation liability to expand the open pit mines  waste dumps and disturbance related to exploration activities 
government regulation mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national  state and local laws and regulations in the united states  which govern prospecting  development  mining  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection of the environment  mine safety  hazardous substances and other matters 
we have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses  permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs 
we believe that allied nevada is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining  health  safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in nevada and the united states and in any other jurisdiction in which we will operate 
we are not aware of any current orders or directions relating to allied nevada with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations 
environmental regulation our gold projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment 
these laws are continually changing and  in general  are becoming more restrictive 
it is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment 
we believe that allied nevada s operations are and will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in nevada  where we operate currently  or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future  could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and or reclamation costs 
although we are unable to predict what additional legislation  if any  might be proposed or enacted  additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this prospectus before deciding to invest or to continue holding your investment in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us or otherwise associated with an investment in our common stock 
additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
we have attempted to identify the major factors under the heading risk factors that could cause differences between actual and planned or expected results  and we have included these material risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually happen  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in this case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
see forward looking statements above 
risks relating to our company we are at an early stage of production and have minimal operating history as an independent company 
our future revenues and profits are uncertain 
we are a production stage venture with minimal operating history as an independent company 
we were incorporated in september and commenced operations in may our principal asset  the hycroft mine  commenced commercial production by the end of there is no certainty that we will consistently produce revenue or consistently operate profitably or provide a return on investment in the future 
if we are unable to consistently generate revenues or profits  investors might not be able to realize returns on their investment in our common stock or keep from losing their investment 
the estimation of the ultimate recovery of gold and silver contained within the hycroft heap leach pad inventory and that of any future mines is subject to variation  subjective  and requires the use of various techniques 
actual recoveries can be expected to vary from estimations 
the hycroft mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract gold and silver from ore 
the heap leach process is a process of extracting gold and silver by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained gold and silver  which are then recovered in metallurgical processes 
we use several integrated steps in the process of extracting gold and silver to estimate the metal content of ore placed on the leach pad 
allied nevada has limited experience with this process 
although we refine our estimates as appropriate at each step in the process  the final amounts are not determined until a third party smelter converts the dor and determines final ounces of gold and silver available for sale 
we then review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and used throughout the production process 
based on this review  we adjust our estimation procedures when appropriate 
due to the complexity of the estimation process and the number of steps involved  among other things  actual recoveries can vary from estimates  and the amount of the variation could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
each of these factors also applies to future development properties not yet in production 
in the case of mines we may develop in the future  we will not have the benefit of actual experience in our estimates with respect to those mines  and there is a greater likelihood that the actual results will vary from the estimates 
in addition  development and expansion projects are subject to unexpected construction and start up problems and delays 
reserve calculations are estimates only  subject to uncertainty due to factors including metal prices  inherent variability of the ore and recoverability of metal in the mining process 
reserve estimates may not be accurate 
there is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves and corresponding grades dedicated to future production 
until reserves are actually mined and processed  the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only 
in addition  the quantity of reserves and ore may vary depending on metal prices 
any material change in the quantity of reserves  mineralization  grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties 
in addition  there can be no assurance that gold recoveries or other metal recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on site conditions or during production 

table of contents our operations are subject to numerous governmental permits which are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require  or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed 
in the ordinary course of business we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for our operations  including operation and expansion of the hycroft mine 
obtaining or renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time consuming process involving costly undertakings by allied nevada 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
we may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations  or the cost to obtain or renew permits may exceed our estimates 
failure to comply with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may result in injunctions  fines  suspension or revocation or permits and other penalties 
there can be no assurance that we have been or will at all times be in full compliance with all such laws and regulations and with our environmental and health and safety permits or that we have all required permits 
the costs and delays associated with compliance with these laws  regulations and permits and with the permitting process could stop us from proceeding with the operation or development of the hycroft mine or increase the costs of development or production and may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may not achieve our production estimates 
we prepare estimates of future production for our operations 
we develop our estimates based on  among other things  mining experience  reserve estimates  assumptions regarding ground conditions and physical characteristics of ores such as hardness and presence or absence of certain metallurgical characteristics and estimated rates and costs of mining and processing 
our actual production may be lower than our production estimates 
each of these factors also applies to future development properties not yet in production and to the hycroft mine 
in the case of mines we may develop in the future  we do not have the benefit of actual experience in our estimates  and there is a greater likelihood that the actual results will vary from the estimates 
in addition  development and expansion projects are subject to unexpected construction and start up problems and delays 
we cannot be certain that our acquisition  exploration and evaluation activities will be commercially successful 
although we have recently attained commercial production at the hycroft mine  substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing gold properties  to establish ore reserves through drilling and analysis  to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the ore and  in the case of new properties  to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining 
we cannot provide assurance that any gold reserves or mineralized material acquired or discovered will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations at other properties or that the funds required for development can be obtained on a timely basis 
whether income will continue to justify commercial operations at the hycroft mine depends on successful mining operations 
factors including costs  actual mineralization  consistency and reliability of ore grades and commodity prices affect successful project development 
the reactivation and efficient operation of processing facilities  the existence of competent operational management and prudent financial administration  as well as the availability and reliability of appropriately skilled and experienced consultants also can affect successful project development which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
the price of gold is subject to fluctuations  which could adversely affect the realizable value of our assets and potential future results of operations and cash flow 
our principal assets are gold reserves and mineralized material 
we intend to attempt to acquire additional properties containing gold reserves and mineralized material 
the price that we pay to acquire these properties will be  in large part  influenced by the price of gold at the time of the acquisition 
our potential future revenues are expected to be  in large part  derived from the mining and sale of gold from these properties or from the outright sale or joint venture of some of these properties 
the value of these gold reserves and mineralized material  and the value of any potential gold production therefrom  will vary in proportion to variations in gold prices 
the price of gold has fluctuated widely  and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including  but not limited to  international  economic and political trends  expectations of inflation  currency exchange fluctuations  central bank activities  interest rates  global or regional consumption patterns  world supply of gold and speculative activities 
the effect of these factors on the price of gold  and therefore the economic viability of any of our projects  cannot accurately be predicted 
any drop in the price of gold would adversely affect our asset values  cash flows  potential revenues and profits 
mining  exploration  development and operating activities are inherently hazardous  and if we incur material leases or liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage  our financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
mineral exploration  development  and operating a mine involves many risks that even a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome 
operations in which we have direct or indirect interests will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration  development and production of gold and other metals  any of which could result in work stoppages  damage to property and possible environmental damage 
the nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed any liability insurance policy limits 
it is also possible that the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable  or  that we could elect not to insure allied nevada against such liabilities due to high premium costs or other reasons  in which event  we could incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents we may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms 
the exploration and development of our development properties will require significant capital investment to achieve commercial production 
we may have to raise additional funds from external sources in order to maintain and advance our existing property positions and to acquire new gold projects 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms and  if additional financing is not available to us  we may have to substantially reduce or cease operations 
we face intense competition in the mining industry 
the mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases 
as a result of this competition  some of which is with large established mining companies with substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours  we may be unable to acquire additional attractive mining claims or financing on terms we consider acceptable 
this  in turn  may adversely affect our financial condition and our future results of operations 
we also compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees 
if we are unable to successfully attract and retain qualified employees  our exploration and development programs may be slowed down or suspended 
in addition  we compete with other gold companies for capital 
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital  our exploration and development programs may be jeopardized or we may not be able to acquire  develop or operate gold projects 
we may depend on outside sources to place our mineral deposit properties into production 
our ability to place our properties into production may be dependent upon using the services of appropriately experienced personnel or contractors and purchasing additional equipment  or entering into agreements with other major resource companies that can provide such expertise or equipment 
there can be no assurance that we will have available to us the necessary expertise or equipment when and if we place our mineral deposit properties into production 
if we are unable to successfully retain such expertise and equipment  our development and growth could be significantly curtailed 
our exploration and development operations are subject to environmental regulations  which could result in the incurrence of additional costs and operational delays 
all phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation 
environmental legislation is evolving in some jurisdictions in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
there is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation  if any  will not adversely affect our projects 
we will be subject to environmental regulations with respect to our properties in nevada  under applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
production at our hycroft mine involves the use of sodium cyanide which is a toxic material 
should sodium cyanide leak or otherwise be discharged from the containment system then allied may become subject to liability for cleanup work that may not be insured 
while appropriate steps will be taken to prevent discharges of pollutants into the ground water and the environment  allied nevada may become subject to liability for hazards that it may not be insured against 
our properties in nevada occupy private and public lands 
the public lands include unpatented mining claims on lands administered by the blm nevada state office 
these claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the us federal government and the state of nevada 
us federal laws under the us resource conservation and recovery act  mining companies may incur costs for generating  transporting  treating  storing  or disposing of hazardous waste  as well as for closure and post closure maintenance once they have completed mining activities on a property 
our mining operations may produce air emissions  including fugitive dust and other air pollutants  from stationary equipment  storage facilities  and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment which are subject to review  monitoring and or control requirements under the federal clean air act and state air quality laws 
permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or create additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules 
the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla imposes strict joint and several liability on parties associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances 
the groups who could be found liable include  among others  the current owners and operators of facilities which release hazardous substances into the environment and past owners and operators of properties who owned such properties at the time the disposal of the hazardous substances occurred 
this liability could include the cost of removal or remediation of the release and damages for injury to the surrounding property 
we cannot predict the potential for future cercla liability with respect to our properties 
nevada laws at the state level  mining operations in nevada are also regulated by the nevada department of conservation and natural resources  division of environmental protection 
nevada state law requires the hycroft mine to hold nevada water pollution control 
table of contents permits  which dictate operating controls and closure and post closure requirements directed at protecting surface and ground water 
in addition  we are required to hold nevada reclamation permits required under nrs a 
through a 
these permits mandate concurrent and post mining reclamation of mines and require the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation 
other nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations 
any changes to these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations by  for example  required changes to operating constraints  technical criteria  fees or surety requirements 
legislation has been proposed that would significantly affect the mining industry 
members of the us congress have repeatedly introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the mining law of if enacted  such legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact our ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims 
such bills have proposed  among other things  to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims 
although it is impossible to predict at this point what any legislated royalties might be  enactment could adversely affect the potential for development of such mining claims and the economics of existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims 
passage of such legislation could adversely affect our financial performance 
increased costs could affect our financial condition 
we anticipate that costs at the hycroft mine  as well as other properties that we may explore or develop  will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors  such as changing ore grade  metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body 
in addition  costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel and electricity 
such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements  including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable 
a material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability 
the global financial crisis may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
the continued credit crisis and related instability in the global financial system has had  and may continue to have  an impact on our business and our financial condition 
we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve 
our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the credit crisis could have an impact on any potential lenders or on our customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 
our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the domestic capital markets and the economy generally 
the stress experienced by domestic capital markets that began in the second half of has continued and substantially increased in both and recently  concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil and gas prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a possible recession 
in addition  the fixed income markets are experiencing a period of extreme volatility which has negatively impacted market liquidity conditions 
initially  the concerns on the part of market participants were focused on the subprime segment of the mortgage backed securities market 
however  these concerns have since expanded to include a broad range of mortgage and asset backed and other fixed income securities  including those rated investment grade  the us and international credit and interbank money markets generally  and a wide range of financial institutions and markets  asset classes and sectors 
as a result  capital markets have experienced decreased liquidity  increased price volatility  credit downgrade events  and increased probabilities of default 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us because our liquidity and ability to fund our capital expenditures is dependent in part upon our bank borrowings and access to the public capital markets 
our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances 
in addition  in the event of extreme prolonged market events  such as the global credit crisis  we could incur significant losses 
even in the absence of a market downturn  we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility 
factors such as business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the profitability of our business 
in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower corporate earnings and lower business investment  our operations could be negatively impacted 
purchasers of our gold production may delay or be unable to make timely payments to us 
adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the current mortgage crisis has also raised the possibility of future legislative and regulatory actions in addition to the recent enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa that could further impact our business 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur  or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents there can be no assurance that actions of the us government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will achieve the intended effect 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   president bush signed the eesa into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
the federal government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
there can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility currently being experienced 
such continued volatility could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  or the trading price of our common stock 
a shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and development operations 
the shortage of such supplies  equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and therefore limit or increase the cost of production 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to establish and develop our business 
our development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees  namely  robert buchan  our executive chairman  scott caldwell  our president and chief executive officer  hal kirby  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  and other key employees that we hire in the future 
although we have entered into employment agreements with key employees as determined by allied nevada  we do not have and currently have no plans to obtain key man insurance with respect to any of our key employees 
as well  we will need to recruit and retain other qualified managerial and technical employees to build and maintain our operations 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain such persons  our development and growth could be significantly curtailed 
our lack of operating experience may cause us difficulty in managing our growth 
we commenced operations on may  as an independent entity and are establishing operating procedures for evaluating  acquiring and developing properties  and negotiating  establishing and maintaining strategic relationships 
our ability to manage our growth  if any  will require us to improve and expand our management and our operational and financial systems and controls 
if our management is unable to manage growth effectively  our business and financial condition would be materially harmed 
in addition  if rapid growth occurs  it may strain our operational  managerial and financial resources 
there are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry 
any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business operations 
our us mineral properties consist of private mineral rights  leases covering state and private lands  leases of patented mining claims  and unpatented mining claims 
many of our mining properties in the us are unpatented mining claims to which we have only possessory title 
because title to unpatented mining claims is subject to inherent uncertainties  it is difficult to determine conclusively ownership of such claims 
these uncertainties relate to such things as sufficiency of mineral discovery  proper posting and marking of boundaries and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record 
since a substantial portion of all mineral exploration  development and mining in the us now occurs on unpatented mining claims  this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry 
the present status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the exclusive right to mine and remove valuable minerals  such as precious and base metals 
we also are allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral bearing ores 
however  legal ownership of the land remains with the us we remain at risk that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the us or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements 
there may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material interest 
if there are title defects with respect to any properties  we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property 
also  in any such case  the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert our management s time from ongoing exploration and development programs 

table of contents our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval  which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the board of directors  possibly conflicting with the interests of our other stockholders 
carl and janet pescio own approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of allied nevada 
in addition to being a major stockholder  mr 
pescio is a director of allied nevada 
because of the pescios major shareholding and mr 
pescio s position on the allied nevada board  the pescios could exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control our business 
this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or entrenching our management or the board of directors  which could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and  consequently  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
some of our directors may have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies 
some of our directors are directors or officers of other natural resource or mining related companies  or may be involved in related pursuits that could present conflicts of interest with their roles at allied nevada 
these associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time 
in the event that any such conflict of interest arises  a director who has such a conflict is required to disclose the conflict to a meeting of the directors of the company in question and to abstain from voting for or against approval of any matter in which such director may have a conflict 
in appropriate cases  we will establish a special committee of independent directors to review a matter in which several directors  or management  may have a conflict 
we are dependent on third parties that are responsible for exploration and development on some of our properties 
our success may be dependent on the efforts and expertise of third parties with whom we have contracted 
certain properties in which allied nevada holds interests are subject to third party contracts 
third parties are responsible for exploration and discovery with respect to certain of allied nevada s mineral properties and related assets 
such third parties are not under allied nevada s control or direction 
we are dependent on such third parties for accurate information with respect to our mining properties and related assets and the progress and development of such properties and assets 
the third parties control the time of exploration and  if warranted  the development of certain of allied nevada s mining properties and related assets 
a third party may be in default of its agreement with allied nevada  without our knowledge  which may put the property and related assets at risk 
risks relating to our common stock our common stock has limited trading history and the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 
our common stock began trading in may and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for allied nevada common stock will be sustained in the future 
we cannot predict the prices at which allied nevada common stock may trade 
the market price of the common stock may fluctuate widely  depending upon many factors  some of which may be beyond the control of allied nevada including  but not limited to  fluctuations in the price of gold  announcements by us or competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions  and overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions 
stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
investors may be unable to accurately value our common stock 
investors often value companies based on the stock prices and results of operations of other comparable companies 
currently  we do not believe another public gold exploration company exists that is directly comparable to our size and scale 
further  the pescios assets had previously been privately held 
prospective investors  therefore  have limited historical information about certain of the properties held by allied nevada upon which to base an evaluation of allied nevada s performance and prospects and an investment in our common stock 
as such  investors may find it difficult to accurately value our common stock 
future sales of our common stock in the public or private markets could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public or private markets  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
as of march    shares of our common stock were outstanding 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock  or the availability of our shares for future sale  will have on the trading price of our common stock 
allied nevada may be considered a foreign investment entity which may have adverse canadian tax consequences for its canadian investors 
under proposed legislation contained in former bill c  amendments to canadian tax rules were proposed by the minister of finance canada regarding the taxation of certain interests in non resident entities that are foreign investment entities fie to be generally applicable for taxation years commencing after the fie proposals 
parliament was dissolved on september   before the fie proposals were enacted 
as part of the january  federal budget  the minister of finance canada announced that the government would be reviewing the fie proposals and submissions made to the government thereon before proceeding with any amendments regarding the taxation of fie 
there can be no assurance that the fie proposals will ultimately be enacted in the form set out in former bill c  or at all 
the fie proposals are exceedingly complex and their application is not clear in certain circumstances 
in general terms  the fie proposals would apply to require a holder that is not an exempt taxpayer that 
table of contents holds a participating interest that is not an exempt interest in a fie to include in income for each taxation year an amount of income or gains computed in accordance with the fie proposals  regardless of whether the holder actually receives any income or realizes any gains 
for purposes of the fie proposals  the allied nevada shares would constitute a participating interest in the company 
if the company is a fie  a holder of an allied nevada share  unless the share is an exempt interest to such holder  would be required to include in income for that year an amount determined  in general terms  by applying a prescribed interest rate to the holder s designated cost of the allied nevada share at the end of each month ending in the holder s taxation year  unless the holder makes a valid election to use either the mark to market method or the accrual method 
in certain limited circumstances  where a holder of allied nevada shares makes a valid election to use the market to market method  such holder will be required to include in income for that year any gains or losses accrued on the allied nevada shares for the year calculated using canadian tax rules 
where a holder of allied nevada shares makes a valid election to use the accrual method  such holder will be required to include in income for that year the holder s proportionate share of allied nevada s income or loss for the year calculated using canadian tax rules 
the holder must include in income the amount so determined notwithstanding that the holder may not have received any corresponding cash distribution from the company 
a prospective holder of allied nevada shares should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the fie proposals to such holder 
to the extent that changes are made to the specific legislation finally implementing the fie proposals such changes could result in the canadian federal income tax considerations described herein being materially different in certain respects 
we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future 
as a result  you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 
our board of directors retains the discretion to change this policy 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under delaware law could make a third party acquisition of the company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock and the ability of our board of directors to amend the bylaws without stockholder approval 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in section collectively  these provisions could make a third party acquisition of the company difficult or could discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we classify our mineral properties into two categories operating properties and exploration properties 
operating properties are properties on which the company operates a producing mine 
we currently have one operating property  namely the hycroft mine as discussed below 
please see below for information about our operating properties and exploration properties 
other than the hycroft mine  we cannot be certain that any mineral deposits will be discovered in sufficient quantities and grade to justify commercial operations 
whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors  including the particular attributes of the deposit  metal prices  which are highly cyclical  the cost to extract and process the mineralized material  and government regulations and permitting requirements 
we may be unable to upgrade our mineralized material to proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations and we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to develop our properties 
estimates of reserves and mineralization herein are subject to the effect of changes in metal prices  and to the risks inherent in mining and processing operations 
in addition  allied nevada has acquired seven geothermal leases during from the blm 
these leases occur in proximity to existing allied nevada mineral holdings  and were obtained through competitive bidding 
operating properties technical report the information that follows relating to the hycroft mine other than the information under the heading hycroft exploration drilling program is derived from  and in some instances is an extract from  the technical report dated may   the hycroft technical report authored by scott wilson  cpg of scott e 
wilson consulting  inc wilson consulting in respect of the hycroft mine and its reactivation  as well as from our current assumptions and life of mine plan 
at the time of the preparation of the hycroft technical report  mr 
wilson was independent of the company and was a qualified person  as that term is defined in canadian securities administrators national instrument ni 

table of contents portions of the following information are based on assumptions  qualifications and procedures which are not fully described herein 
reference should be made to the full text of the hycroft technical report which has been filed with certain canadian securities regulatory authorities pursuant to ni and is available for review at www 
sedar 
com 
allied nevada expects to file a ni technical report with an updated reserve and resource estimate in the second quarter of hycroft mine logo we currently have one operating property  the hycroft mine  which we also refer to as the hycroft mine in this document 
this mine and related facilities are located miles west of winnemucca  nevada 
winnemucca population  is a commercial community on interstate  miles northeast of reno  nevada 
the town is served by a transcontinental railroad and has a small airport 
access to the hycroft mine from winnemucca  nevada is by means of state road no 
jungo road  a well maintained gravel road 
the entrance to the mine is several hundred feet off the road 
well maintained mine and exploration roads provide access throughout the property 
access is also possible from imlay and from lovelock by unpaved roads intersecting interstate the majority of our employees live in the winnemucca area 
the mine is situated on the eastern edge of the black rock desert and on the western flank of the kamma mountains between winnemucca and gerlach  nevada 
there are no streams  rivers  or major lakes in the general area 
elevations in the mine area range between  and  ft above sea level 
the company holds patented and  unpatented mining claims that constitute our hycroft mine operating property 
the total acreage covered by these claims is approximately  acres with approximately  acres related to the patented claims 
the details of these claims and the holding requirements are discussed in greater detail in the geology and ore reserve section that follows 
the climate of the region is arid  with precipitation averaging inches per year 
temperatures during the summer range from f to greater than f and winter temperatures range from f to f 
there is strong surface heating during the day and rapid nighttime cooling because of the dry air 
this results in wide ranges in daily temperatures 
the hycroft mine consists of multiple open pit mines  associated waste dumps and two heap leach pads 
the hycroft mine was formally known as the crofoot lewis open pit mine 
mining began in the area in with a small heap leaching operation known as the lewis mine 
lewis mine production was followed by production from the crofoot property in the bay  south central  boneyard  gap and cut pits along the central fault  and finally the north end of the brimstone pit and continued until it was placed on a care and maintenance program in december due to low gold prices 
the lewis mine was acquired by vista in early from fw lewis  inc and the crofoot mine was acquired by vista in april the leasehold interest in the lewis property along with gold and silver nsrs was purchased from fw lewis  inc by vista on december  in consideration of the payment of million 
the crofoot property was originally held under two leases and is now owned by allied nevada subject to a net profits interest retained by the former owners 
the lease agreements include for the payment of advance royalty payments of million in any year where mining occurs on the crofoot claims 
all advance royalty payments are credited against the future payments under the net profits royalty 

table of contents the hycroft mine produced over one million ounces of gold from the commencement of mining operations in  until the operations were placed on a care and maintenance program  as a result of low gold prices in december of gold production from the leaching and rinsing of the heap leach pads  continued in and in   and  the amount of gold recovered was not material 
during  the hycroft mine completed its first full year of mining operations and the company sold  ounces of gold 
the company mined million tonnes of material including million tonnes of ore at an average grade of g t gold and g t silver 
the mine placed approximately  ounces of gold on the pad and approximately  ounces of silver or  ounces of recoverable gold and  ounces of recoverable silver 
the mine did not achieve management s expected production rates in due to a number of operational challenges stemming from a delay in operating the newly constructed areas of leach pad expansion 
in addition to these short term operating challenges at hycroft  it was discovered in the fourth quarter that cyanide consumption was much higher than anticipated 
the acid leach material mined in  for which we have only limited historical operating data  had relatively high sulphur and silver grades requiring a higher cyanide concentration be used 
this has resulted in the shortfall in ounces sold in these issues have been corrected and production levels and leach pad performance are meeting expectation 
for the months of january and february  the mine produced approximately  ounces of gold and approximately  ounces of silver  indicating the mine has now achieved normal production rates 
current production from the new areas of pad under leach is performing as expected with recoveries and gold release within planned levels 
these were short term issues which management believes have been resolved and should not affect production going forward 
the major activities that occurred during were as follows in march  we announced an update to the resource estimate at hycroft of gold measured and indicated resources of million ounces million tonnes at grams per tonne g t using a cut off grade of g t for oxide material and g t for sulphide material and silver measured and indicated resources of million ounces million tonnes at g t 
inferred silver resources were million tonnes grading g t 
the resource estimate was derived from  holes drilled on the property 
the majority of the increase in oxide measured and indicated ounces is due to the result of metallurgical test work on the material contained in the oxide sulphide boundary zone 
inferred resources declined slightly as more inferred ounces were converted to the measured and indicated category than were replaced by new additions 
proven and probable reserves of million ounces of gold million tonnes grading g t from previously reported reserves in september did not change as a result of this new estimate 
a resource update is expected by the end of the first quarter of in april  we announced positive initial metallurgical results on sulphide mineralization which indicated that the mineralization is amenable to concentration using simple  conventional flotation technology 
rougher flotation results revealed recovery of gold and silver in the high range using a coarse grind with cleaner flotation results indicating an overall flotation concentration in excess of this has been confirmed with subsequent testing and ongoing work will continue to identify the most cost effective extraction methods and optimal processing plan for the sulphide mineralization 
additional testing completed in confirmed these results 
testing of new samples taken from other areas of the mine are nearing completion and results are anticipated by the end of the first quarter of in july  we completed the construction of a new refinery at hycroft allowing for the refining of metals on site  reducing the time to produce and sell dor 
in august  we completed a cross border public offering of  shares of common stock of the company at a price of cdn per common share  for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately cdn  this provided a much stronger balance sheet  thereby allowing the company more flexibility to accelerate its exploration program to aid in expansion and optimization studies for oxide mineralization and development of a feasibility study for sulphide mineralization 
in september  we began an accelerated exploration program at hycroft following the completion of the august public offering 
in  we drilled holes  totaling approximately  meters  with an encouraging discovery in the vortex zone to the south of the brimstone pit of high grade silver mineralization 
as announced in  this drilling indicates that we may have discovered the mineralizing feeder system  however  further drilling is required to confirm the continuity of this high grade mineralization 
in november  we completed the second phase of the brimstone leach pad expansion  a million square foot expansion on time and on budget 
all cells of the expansion are now under leach and performing as expected 
in  we received a sentinels of safety award at hycroft for  highlighting the mine s excellent safety record 

table of contents capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
at hycroft  we expect to begin construction on phase three of the brimstone leach pad expansion in the second quarter of this phase will increase the available heap leach pad space by a further million square feet at a capital cost of approximately million 
construction of this third phase of the expansion is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of in addition  we announced our intention to begin crushing ore at hycroft in with the purchase of a mobile crushing system capable of crushing four million tonnes of material per year or approximately of ore tonnes mined  expected in the first half of the year 
with the addition of this system  gold recovery of crushed ore is expected to increase from current run of mine performance of to approximately and silver recovery of crushed ore is expected to increase from current run of mine performance of to approximately 
hycroft will also expand the mining fleet with the addition of a second production drill  a d size dozer  primarily to be used for the reclamation of the historic crofoot leach pad  and other ancillary mining and production equipment 
we are expecting to provide a reserve and resource update in the first quarter of metallurgical test work is escalating with the significant number of samples of oxide and sulphide mineralization attained during the drill season  and we expect to be releasing results of this test work over the course of the year 
a significant portion of the metallurgical test work will focus on property wide sulphide mineralization in preparation of a feasibility study  expected in the first half of geology the hycroft mine is located on the western flank of the kamma mountains 
the deposit is hosted in a volcanic eruptive breccia and conglomerates associated with the tertiary kamma mountain volcanics 
the volcanics are mainly acidic to intermediate tuffs  flows and coarse volcaniclastic rocks 
fragments of these units dominate the clasts in the eruptive breccia 
volcanic rocks have been block faulted by dominant north trending structures  which have affected the distribution of alteration and mineralization 
the central fault and east fault control the distribution of mineralization and subsequent oxidation 
a post mineral range front fault separates the orebody from the adjacent pleistocene lahontan lake sediments in the black rock desert 
the known gold mineralization within the crofoot and lewis properties extends for a distance of three miles in a north south direction by miles in an east west direction 
mineralization extends to a depth of less than feet in the outcropping to near outcropping portion of the deposit on the northwest side to over  feet in the brimstone deposit in the east 
not all the mineralization is oxidized and the depth of oxide ore varies considerably over the area of mineralization 
we currently have patented claims that comprise approximately  acres and  unpatented claims that comprise approximately  acres 
combining the patented and unpatented claims  our claims total approximately  acres 
this claim package was acquired by the company in a series of transactions the crofoot property and approximately  acres of claims were acquired by vista in the crofoot property  originally held under lease  is owned by hycroft resources development  inc subject to a net profits interest retained by the former owners 
the fw lewis property and approximately  acres of claims were acquired by vista in early in  approximately  acres of additional claims were staked by vista 
these claims were around or contiguous to the original crofoot and fw lewis claims 
in  we staked approximately  acres of additional claims contiguous to or around the existing hycroft claims 
in  we staked an additional claims contiguous to or around the existing hycroft land holding 
our hycroft patented claims occupy private lands and our unpatented claims occupy public lands 
the public lands include unpatented mining claims on lands administered by the blm 
these claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the us federal government and the state of nevada 
to maintain the patented claims in good standing  we must pay the annual property tax payments to the county in which the claims are held 
to maintain the unpatented claims in good standing  we must file a notice of intent to maintain the claims and pay the annual mineral claim filing fees to the state and the blm 
ore reserves wilson consulting  inc issued the hycroft technical report on may   in accordance with ni guidelines 
the report and verification of the data employed in the report was undertaken under the supervision of mr 
scott wilson  cpg  a qualified person under ni and independent of allied nevada 
allied nevada expects to release an updated reserve and resource statement in a ni technical report in the second quarter of wilson consulting  inc prepared this technical report of the hycroft mine at our request 
this report was intended to provide a technical summary of the hycroft mine gold and silver resources and reserves for allied nevada 
this technical report is written in compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the ni  companion policy cp  and form f and reconciled as appropriate to conform to sec industry guide prior to this report  wilson consulting  inc had authored a technical report pertaining to the hycroft mine dated october  the technical information contained in the may  technical report reflects material changes that occurred since the october report 

table of contents wilson consulting  inc evaluated allied nevada s current economic forecasts and used these criteria to report the proven and probable mineral reserves for the hycroft mine 
mining sequences were determined and mining plans were developed 
wilson consulting  inc believed that there had been sufficient evaluations of mining  processing  economic and environmental factors to support the determination of proven and probable reserves for the hycroft mine 
wilson consulting  utilizing the guidelines prescribed by ni and sec industry guide  determined proven and probable mineral reserves within a pit design that is economic using a cutoff grade of grams per tonne of gold 
in compliance with sec industry guide  these reported reserves were determined to be economic using a gold price average of this gold price is lower than the maximum gold price allowed for reserve determination 
gold recovery utilizing a run of mine heap leach process is estimated to be for both proven and probable reserves 
below is a summary of the mineral reserves and resources per the may  technical report category tonnes g t au contained ounces au total waste tonnes strip ratio s s gold proven reserves probable reserves proven and probable reserves other mineralized material silver other mineralized materials mineralized material  as used in this form k  although permissible under sec industry guide  does not indicate reserves by sec standards 
we cannot be certain that any part of the deposits will ever be confirmed or converted into sec industry guide compliant reserves 
you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted 
mine operations the mining of our current proven and probable ore reserves in the brimstone pit and cut pit will be conducted by open pit methods using ton haul trucks  yard wheel loaders and dml blast hole drills 
mining in the brimstone pit has been designed with five mining phases  and the cut pit will be mined in one single top down mining sequence 
our current mine plans are based upon an annual mining rate of million tonnes of material per year  using foot lifts and three lifts per catch bench 
we are currently in the second phase of five phases of mining in the brimstone pit 
this phase of mining involves the mining of more ore and less waste  as experienced in the previous phase  and it is expected that the strip ratio will be lower than the average life of mine strip ratio of in january  the board of directors of allied nevada approved the purchase of a mobile crushing unit at hycroft 
this crushing unit  capable of crushing twelve thousand tonnes per day to inch minus  is expected to be operational by mid year acid leach material  which is relatively soft material and does not require crushing  will make up most of the feed for  and we will transition to harder siliceous ore  which will be processed through the crusher in the second half of it is anticipated that we will mine out the acid leach material by mid  and we may ultimately add two more similar crushing systems as more siliceous ore feed comes available 
for most of  we will haul and place the ore production from the mine on the brimstone pad system as run of mine material 
once the crusher is installed  higher grade siliceous ore will be crushed and hauled to the leach pad 
the brimstone pad system is currently comprised of the previously operated brimstone leach pad and the million square foot leach pad expansions we completed in and this leach pad system has sufficient capacity to handle our ore placement requirements for we plan to continually expand this leach pad system in and future years as production requires 
all ore grade material placed on the leach pad will be cross ripped to enhance permeability 
a network of solution drip lines will be positioned and the run of mine material will be leached with a cyanide solution for a period of to days before another ft high lift of ore is placed on top of the existing lift 
return solution from the pad containing the precious metals is directed to the pregnant solution pond 
gold will be removed from pregnant solutions using a cil process and at the brimstone plant using the merrill crowe process 
the product from the cil process will be transported to a third party for processing to recover the precious metals from the carbon and produce a dor containing gold and silver 
dor containing gold and silver will be produced at the hycroft mine from the merrill crowe process 
based on previous operating experience of the gold placed on the pad as run of mine production is expected to be recovered in the plant 
crushing ore is expected to improve recovery of gold and silver to approximately and  respectively 

table of contents the dor containing gold and silver will then be shipped to a contract refinery to be further processed into gold and silver bullion 
the contained gold and silver is typically sold in either a dor or bullion form 
when sold in a dor format  the contained gold and silver will be sold to a metals merchant who will ultimately receive the delivery of bullion from the refinery 
alternatively  we can sell the gold and silver bullions once the refining process has been completed 
during  we expect to evaluate a number of alternatives to increase the annual gold production from the hycroft mine 
the alternatives we are considering include the following increasing mining rates in order to increase annual gold production 
initial studies show that the mine plan and process facilities can accommodate a expansion to mining rates 
this increased mining rate would be accomplished by the use of a mining contractor or the purchase of additional mining equipment 
a increase to the total mining rate would be expected to increase ore production by approximately million tonnes per annum and would increase annual gold production by   ounces per year 
operating costs are expected to be similar to those presently experienced at the mine 
by increasing the grade of gold and silver in the pregnant solution  the operating efficiencies of the merrill crowe plant and the cil plant would improve 
the operating plan includes the expansion of ponds  pumps  piping and leach pads to allow for stacking of the pregnant solution increasing the grade of the pregnant solution 
the benefits of this optimization program would not be realized until additionally  we expect to continue our oxide exploration drilling program in and future years to identify additional proven and probable oxide reserves that could ultimately increase the total amount of gold mined at the hycroft mine 
the site receives line current provided by nvenergy from the northwestern power grid 
with the cooperation of the power provider  we inspected the substations  power lines and transformers and repaired and replaced any necessary components 
we currently have water rights  which we believe are adequate to process the planned ore 
we have rehabilitated the primary process water well and fresh water well and have developed a new back up process water well 
hycroft mine exploration since the formation of the company in may  allied nevada  as of year end  has drilled a total of holes  for combined total of  meters  at the hycroft mine 
material from all the holes has been assayed using a fire assay procedure for both gold and silver content by one of two independent laboratories 
upon completion of a drill hole  the hole is surveyed and then plugged 
management of the drill program  sample collection and assay program is being carried out by allied nevada 
qualified independent consultants have reviewed all aspects of the exploration program and are expected to conduct regular reviews of the ongoing exploration program 
in  we drilled holes  representing approximately  meters  with an encouraging discovery in the vortex zone to the south of the brimstone pit of high grade silver mineralization 
as announced in early  this drilling indicates that we may have discovered the mineralizing feeder system  however  further drilling is required to confirm the continuity of this high grade mineralization 
we are expecting to announce a reserve update in  incorporating all drilling to the end of january of the total program  holes were directed towards infill of the vortex zone and holes towards infill of the bay area 
the balance of the holes were primarily drilled to obtain material for metallurgical testing of other zones 
a  meter exploration program has been designed for with a focus on expanding oxide and sulphide resources  improving the confidence level of oxide resources to the reserve categories  and testing the extent of high grade silver anomalies encountered at the end of the drill season 
exploration spending at hycroft will be success driven and is expected to be approximately million in in addition  the company may conduct targeted surface exploration and drilling on certain of its advanced and exploration properties where the company believes encouraging exploration opportunities exist 
management intends to continue exploration drilling on the sulphide system in additional metallurgical testing and engineering work in will be conducted as part of a pre feasibility study evaluating the economic viability of the sulphide mineralization 
the study is expected to be completed in the analysis of the current drill results and historical geological information suggests that gold and silver mineralization is hosted along north south trending zones of approximately  feet in length 
these zones are partially defined laterally by post mineral faults 
the following individual zones  from west to east  currently recognized are camel  cove  central  boneyard  albert  fire  brimstone  and vortex 
the program is planned to include further exploration of the vortex  albert  cut and bay area zones 
any expansion of the hycroft mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan  will require us to obtain all necessary permits  approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in nevada 

table of contents exploration properties exploration properties are both those properties where we retain a significant controlling interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material and more than earlier stage exploration properties

a gravel road provides immediate access to the property from the ruby valley road 
the property consists of claims with a total area of approximately  acres 
on october   vista completed the acquisition of a interest in the maverick springs gold and silver project from newmont mining corporation newmont and the mountain view gold project described below from newmont s wholly owned subsidiary newmont capital limited newmont capital 
maverick springs is subject to a lease agreement  between newmont and artemis exploration company 
the lease was entered into on october   and the key terms include payment of advance minimum royalties of  on october  this has been paid and advance minimum royalties of  on october  this has been paid   on october  this has been paid and each year thereafter while the agreement is in effect  work commitments of  feet of exploration drilling  on or before october in each of extended by agreement to november   and these commitments have been met  a preliminary economic evaluation to be conducted by october  which was extended to april  this has been completed  and a net smelter returns royalty based on a sliding scale ranging from to  depending on gold and silver prices at the time of production 
on june   vista entered into an agreement granting silver standard resources inc silver standard an option to acquire its interest in the silver mineralized material hosted in the maverick springs project 
allied nevada  as successor to vista  will retain its interest in the gold mineralized material 
the agreement with ssri is subject to the terms of the newmont purchase agreement 
under the agreement  silver standard was to pay million over four years  completing the million obligation in since silver standard has satisfied the million obligation  all costs incurred for maverick springs are now being shared by 
table of contents the two corporations as stated below 
silver standard and vista formed a committee to jointly manage exploration of the maverick springs project 
allied nevada  as successor to vista  has a vote on the committee  and silver standard is the operator and has a vote 
since silver standard has completed its million in payments  future costs will be shared by silver standard and allied nevada on the same ratio as established for operation of the management committee allied nevada silver standard  subject to standard dilution provisions 
prior operators have conducted drilling on the maverick springs project 
in november  vista completed a hole reverse circulation drill program totaling  feet on the maverick springs project 
the program consisted of seven vertical reverse circulation holes  stepped out feet to  feet from previously identified mineralization 
all seven holes encountered flat lying mineralization  predominantly oxidized to depths of up to feet 
the program outlined continuous mineralization in a  foot by  foot area  immediately adjacent to known gold silver mineralization 
with additional in fill drilling  this newly outlined mineralization has the potential to significantly increase the mineralized material 
in october  vista completed a hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet  in october  vista completed a hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet and in august  vista completed a hole reverse circulation drill program totaling approximately  feet 
in the th quarter of  silver standard completed a hole program totaling  feet 
these results indicate the potential for bulk mineable gold silver mineralization 
geology maverick springs can be classified as a carlin type or sediment carbonate hosted disseminated silver gold deposit 
sediment hosted deposits are common within northern nevada  although the systems are usually gold dominated with relatively minor amounts of silver 
silver and gold mineralization at maverick springs has been interpreted as a roughly antiformal or arch shaped zone with an axis that plunges shallowly to the south and seems to flatten to horizontal over the northern half of the deposit 
the limbs of the arch dip shallowly to moderately at o to the east and west 
overall  the mineralized zone is elongated in the north south direction with a length of over  feet  a width of up to  feet  and a thickness of commonly feet 
mineralization consists of micron sized silver and gold with related pyrite  stibnite and arsenic sulphides 
it is usually associated with intense fracturing and brecciation  with or without accompanying whole rock silicification or stockwork quartz 
alteration consists of pervasive decalcification  weak to intense silicification and weak alunitic argillization 
massive jasperoid is common in surface exposures and in drill core 
oxidation has affected all sulphides on surface and is pervasive to a depth of at least feet  intermittent to feet  and generally absent below  feet 
based on a third party technical study performed on behalf of vista  the maverick springs project contains approximately million tonnes of mineralized material with an average grade of grams of gold per tonne and grams of silver per tonne at a silver equivalent cut off grade of grams of silver per tonne 
mountain view the mountain view property is located in northwest nevada near the blackrock desert 
the property is approximately miles northwest of gerlach  nevada in washoe county  it straddles the boundary between the squaw valley and banjo topographic quadrangles 
the property is accessed from gerlach by traveling approximately miles along nevada state highway  a paved road  and then approximately one mile east along an unimproved dirt road 
on the property  drill roads provide good access to most areas 
the property currently consists of claims with a total area of approximately  acres 
vista s acquisition of the mountain view property was completed along with that of the maverick springs property  as described above 
to acquire the interest in the mountain view property  vista paid cash of  and issued  equity units  each unit comprised of one vista share and a two year vista warrant  to newmont capital  and newmont capital retains a nsr 
newmont capital s interest in the mountain view property is subject to an underlying lease and two other royalty arrangements  the principal terms of which are the underlying lease grants a interest to newmont in all claims  with a few exceptions where a interest is granted  and the lessee may purchase the remaining interest in the claims for  at any time 
the lessee is obligated to purchase the remaining for  on achieving commercial production 
also  the lessee shall pay a nsr during production  with advance minimum payments of  per year 
advanced royalties are deductible from the net smelter returns royalty and cease upon purchase of the remaining interest of the underlying lease 
a nsr also applies to certain other claims 
prior operators have conducted drilling on the mountain view property 
vista completed a five hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet in november the results indicate the presence of a new zone of bulk mineralization approximately feet east of the known core of mineralization 
vista completed a five hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet in  and the results indicate potential bulk mineable gold mineralization and the down dip extension of higher grade gold mineralization 
geology the dominant rock types in the area are miocene volcanics and interbedded volcaniclastic sediments 
minor greenschist facies permo triassic strata occur to the northeast and a large body of granodiorite makes up the bulk of the granite range to the east and south 

table of contents the miocene lithologies consist of mafic tuffs  rhyolite tuffs and flows  volcaniclastic sediments and basalts 
these units are separated from the granite range to the east by a range front normal fault that dips steeply to the southwest 
the severance deposit is hosted by a unit known as the severance rhyolite that is sandwiched between the range front fault to the northeast and older tertiary tuffs  flows and volcaniclastic sediments to the southwest 
structure on the property is dominated by northwest and northeast trending faults 
major fault offsets occur along the range front fault system and these are offset by the northeast trending structures 
recent alluvium is offset by the range front faults 
based on a third party technical study performed on behalf of vista  the mountain view project contains approximately million tonnes of gold mineralized material with an average grade of grams of gold per tonne at a cut off grade of grams of gold per tonne 
hasbrouck the hasbrouck property is located in southwestern nevada about miles south southwest of the town of tonopah in esmeralda county  nevada  adjacent to us highway and approximately half way between reno and las vegas 
the hasbrouck property is located about five miles south of tonopah  nevada 
the property is accessed from tonopah by traveling south along state highway  which transects the claim block 
the project is accessed by a gravel road off of us highway that connects to a network of dirt drill roads that traverse hasbrouck mountain 
the property consists of patented lode mining claims and unpatented lode claims that cover an area of approximately  acres 
on may   vista executed a purchase agreement with newmont capital  which includes both the hasbrouck property and the three hills property  which lies approximately miles to the north northwest 
newmont capital  at its option  will retain either a a nsr in each project together with the right to a  cash payment at the start of commercial production at either project and a further  cash payment if  after the start of commercial production  the gold price averages per ounce or more for any three month period  or b the right to acquire of either or both projects 
the latter right would be exercisable only after the later of four years or the time when allied nevada  and historically vista  have incurred aggregate expenditures of million to acquire  explore and hold the projects and would include newmont capital paying to allied nevada cash equaling of the expenditures made by allied nevada  and historically vista  on the related property 
in this event  newmont capital would become operator of a joint venture with allied nevada  and both parties would fund the project through to a production decision 
allied nevada s contribution to the joint venture during this period is capped at million  million of which newmont capital would finance for allied nevada and recover  with interest  exclusively from related project cash flows 
allied nevada would also grant newmont capital a right of first offer with respect to subsequent sale of the projects by allied nevada 
an additional nsr on the hasbrouck property is held by a private party 
geology the property is located on hasbrouck mountain  which is thought to lie along the western edge of a caldera 
the mountain is underlain by gently dipping ash flow  air fall and waterlain tuffs and volcaniclastic sediments of the miocene siebert formation 
several occurrences of chalcedonic sinter deposits occur near the summit of the mountain 
gold and silver mineralization in the hasbrouck deposit appears to have formed relatively close to the paleo surface in an epithermal  hot spring environment 
the mineralization is concentrated in the siebert formation  in units stratigraphically below the chalcedonic sinter deposits that are exposed near the top of hasbrouck mountain 
two zones of mineralization are presently defined 
the main zone includes the bulk of mineralization at hasbrouck  while the small south adit zone lies to feet to the south of the main zone 
a third party technical study was completed for vista in august and was updated in august the hasbrouck study was developed using data from  feet of drilling  principally comprised of reverse circulation holes totaling  feet and rotary drill holes totaling  feet 
the drilling database was compiled from work performed by fmc gold co  cordex syndicate and franco nevada inc between and based on this study  mineralized material above a cut off of grams of gold per tonne is million tonnes with an average grade of grams of gold per tonne and grams of silver per tonne 
three hills three hills is located in southwestern nevada about mile west of the town of tonopah in esmeralda county  nevada  and about miles northwest of the hasbrouck property described above 
access to the site is via county maintained gravel roads from the northwest end of town 
three hills consists of unpatented lode claims totaling approximately acres 
on may   vista executed a purchase agreement with newmont capital  which included both the hasbrouck property and the three hills property 
the terms of this agreement are detailed under the hasbrouck description above 
geology three hills is located in the walker lane structural domain of the basin and range physiographic province 
it is in an area of structural disruption resulting from a series of orogenic events occurring in paleozoic  mesozoic and cenozoic times 
basin and range high angle normal faults control the mineralization at three hills  where they cut the siebert formation 
gold mineralization occurs in a zone of pervasive silicification and in the siebert formation and the upper to feet of the fraction tuff 
the contact between these two units contains consistently higher grades of gold and is more commonly argillized than silicified 

table of contents a third party technical study was completed for vista in august and was updated in august the three hills study included data from  feet of drilling  comprised of reverse circulation holes totaling  feet  air track and rotary holes totaling  feet and diamond drill holes totaling  feet 
the drilling was completed by echo bay mines ltd  eastfield resources  saga exploration and cordex syndicate between and based on this study  gold mineralized material above a cut off of grams of gold per tonne was million tonnes with an average grade of grams of gold per tonne 
wildcat wildcat is located about miles northwest of lovelock and miles south of the hycroft mine in pershing county  nevada 
the property is accessed  from lovelock  by traveling miles along nevada state route  a paved road  and then approximately miles along a well maintained gravel road through sage valley 
the east property boundary is approximately miles west of the road through sage valley  along a gravel road 
four wheel drive roads traverse the property 
the project consists of unpatented claims and patented claims  comprising  acres 
during september and october  vista concluded due diligence reviews and executed formal purchase agreements to acquire the wildcat project and the associated exploration data in three separate transactions 
on september   vista purchased unpatented mining claims from monex exploration 
on commencement of commercial production  allied nevada will make a one time production payment in the amount of  thirteen of the claims are subject to an underlying nsr  and the remaining claims are subject to an underlying nsr 
on october   vista purchased a interest in the vernal unpatented mining claim from david c 
mough and jody ahlquist mough 
on october   vista purchased four patented mining claims and exploration data from sagebrush exploration  inc the four patented claims are subject to an underlying net smelter returns royalty of for gold production between  and  ounces  increasing to on production in excess of  ounces 
geology wildcat lies in the seven troughs range which is underlain by triassic and jurassic sedimentary rocks and has been intruded by cretaceous granodiorite 
volcanic domes and plugs of rhyolite  quartz latite  trachyte  and andesite have been emplaced by tertiary volcanism 
tertiary flows of pyroclastic debris  and vitrophyres of rhyolite  quartz latite  trachyte  and andesite composition blanket much of the area 
the property contains structurally controlled epithermal gold and silver mineralization identified in four areas hero tag  main  northeast and knob the four areas have generally similar geology and mineralization with precious metals mineralization spatially associated with the contact between granodiorite and overlying tuff 
gold mineralization occurs with low temperature silica  chalcedony and pyrite 
the main  northeast  and knob deposits appear to be part of the hero tag deposit  though structurally displaced 
the principal low grade zone that essentially encompassed all the mineralization is tabular and dips gently to the southeast 
there appear to be two main styles of mineralization based on mapping  sampling  and statistics 
there is a broad  low grade zone surrounding higher grade material 
the principal host is the tuff in which the low grade precious metal mineralization is represented by pervasive and intense silicification 
the underlying granodiorite also contains a low grade disseminated style of mineralization with higher grade silicified breccias occurring generally as stockwork within it 
generally  the granodiorite has higher grade and is not silicified 
any silicification is restricted to adjacent veins and veinlets  occasionally being discrete veins as were exploited historically  but also resulting in a large tonnage stockwork 
all of the tuff was altered by epithermal solutions  however  much of the granodiorite is unaltered 
high grade material includes multi episodic chalcedonic silica veins and breccias 
a third party technical study was completed for vista in november and was updated in august using data from one underground channel sample  reverse circulation drill holes and diamond drill holes totaling  feet  gold mineralized material above a cut off grade of grams of gold per tonne was estimated at million tonnes grading grams of gold per tonne and grams of silver per tonne 
pony creek elliot dome property the pony creek elliot dome property is located in the larrabee mining district of elko county  nevada  in the southern half of the carlin trend  miles southeast of the town of carlin and miles south of newmont gold company s rain mine 
the property is accessed by traveling south from carlin along state highway a paved road  and then west on the pony creek road 
the pony creek elliot dome property consists of unpatented lode mining claims approximately  acres 
the property is located across the crest of the southern part of the pinyon range at elevations ranging from  feet to about  feet 
access to the property from the west is by traveling the indian pony road off state highway  or from the east via the red rock ranch road off a junction with state highway the exploration agreement previously in effect with mill city was terminated in allied nevada is in the process of regaining full title to the property 
pursuant to the agreement previously in effect  mill city owned a interest in the property and was to pay an nsr of 
escalating annual property payments would have to be made to allied nevada and mill city had the option 
table of contents to purchase of the nsr for a total of million 
mill city was to pay annual rentals to the blm of per claim on or before september of each year and appropriate county filing fees to the elko county recorder on or before november of each year 
allied nevada  being the holder of a royalty on the claims  held contractual rights that in certain circumstances would require the record owner to transfer ownership of the claims to allied nevada 
prior to commencement of any surface disturbance  permits must be obtained from the blm which permits exploration activities and a reclamation bond must also be posted 
newmont exploration ltd 
newmont exploration conducted regional exploration programs in search of additional gold deposits along the carlin trend 
in a stream sediment sampling program identified anomalous gold and arsenic associated with an altered rhyolite body at what is now the pony creek property 
newmont located claims in to cover the prospect and located more claims in to cover additional ground 
newmont began drilling in and conducted drill programs through newmont conducted additional drilling campaigns in and with limited success 
an option was acquired by westmont mining  inc in  and in april of quest international management services  inc formerly ramrod gold  inc 
acquired westmont 
quest then joint ventured the property with uranerz usa  inc in uranerz drilled a total of holes in before terminating the jv in in quest purchased newmont s remaining interest in the property and signed a jv agreement with barrick 
four holes were drilled by barrick before they terminated the agreement in in  quest international resources was acquired by standard mining co 
and it abandoned the pony creek property 
mr 
pescio acquired pony creek by staking claims in the fall of homestake optioned the property shortly afterward 
a year later  after drilling reverse circulation drill holes  homestake terminated their agreement with mr 
pescio 
nevada contact inc optioned the property from the pescios in and drilled holes before terminating the agreement in early in july  mill city optioned the property from the pescios 
the mill city agreement was terminated in geology most of the property is comprised of dry  sagebrush and grass covered hills with a few juniper and pinyon pines 
the climate is favorable for year round mining and exploration may be done from may through november 
power for a modern mill can be brought in from the vicinity of elko  but ranch power is available only a few miles away 
water is not available on the surface  but was encountered in most of the reverse circulation drill holes 
water may also be present in sufficient quantities in the nearby valleys to the east and west 
the claims carry with them the surface rights for mining 
although the area is hilly  sufficient flat areas are present in the property area for potential processing plant sites  tailings storage areas  waste disposal areas and leach pads 
the pony creek property lies along the axis of a regional mesozoic anticline that parallels the crest of the pinyon range 
the project area is within a zone of convergence of two major structural trends which are the boundaries of a north south series of grabens and half grabens collectively referred to as the pinyon graben 
a series of tertiary felsic intrusives have been emplaced at various points along this structural zone 
the lithologies of the region include the allochthonous  eugeoclinal  siliceous western assemblage  the autochthonous  miogeoclinal  eastern carbonate assemblage and the mixed overlap assemblage 
the late devonian early mississippian roberts mountain thrust and the post pinyon anticline  mesozoic thrust faults have moved the western assemblage and a significant portion of the overlap series over the eastern facies 
other important stratigraphic units of the region are mississippian through pennsylvanian clastics of the overlap assemblage which overlie both autochthonous and allochthonous units of the roberts mountains thrust 
younger late pennsylvanian to early permian clastics disconformably overlie the overlap assemblage 
in the pinyon range  high angle northeast and northwest trending faults and north trending faults  all with oblique displacement  and a younger set of east trending normal faults  are important elements in the structural framework of the region 
a tertiary age wrench faulting event  characterized by strike slip faulting and intrusion of felsic rocks into graben faults  probably contributed to the emplacement of gold deposits into the pinyon graben 
gold mineralization in the bowl area is related to felsite breccias 
the porphyritic phase consists of a series of rocks from feldspar porphyry to quartz porphyry and ranges in color from white to medium gray 
the fragmental unit contains up to of to mm diameter rounded and embayed quartz phenocrysts and feldspar phenocrysts in a white to light gray  fine grained  ash rich  clastic matrix 
the dark colored felsite is very similar to the feldspar porphyry except that the aphanitic felsite is often nearly black 
porphyritic felsite appears to be interbedded with the fragmental felsite in gently dipping tabular masses up to thick 
in the pot holes area a lens of fragmental felsite approximately feet thick intersects the low angle fault that is at the base of the robinson thrust plate 
the felsite breccias of the bowl area may be fault breccia to explosion breccias 
the breccia fragments are of variable lithology  reportedly including sediment fragments 
the matrix  which is generally altered  consists of fragmental felsite and is termed a sandy rhyolite 
the breccias are mineralized in the bowl area and possibly are important hosts in other parts of the property 
alteration within the rhyolite intrusive includes quartz sericite pyrite qsp associated with north and northeast trending shears 
the shear zones are fragmental and brecciated and contain very fine grained quartz  sericite and pyrite goethite  both as disseminations and on fractures 
away from the shear zones the rhyolite gradually becomes fresher  grading outward from relict feldspar ghosts into porphyritic rhyolite 
in the center of the intrusive along the east flank of rhyolite hill  as well as in some other 
table of contents areas  the intrusive has a granular texture and feldspars have been altered  leaving open clay filled vugs 
the sanded rhyolite consists of medium grained rounded clasts of glassy rhyolite breccia occurring near the margins and at the base of the intrusive  and locally as narrow stockwork zones in the intrusive 
the distribution and texture of the sanded rhyolite suggest that the unit formed in vitric chill margins and apparently was partially fluidized by subsequent hydrothermal activity 
sediments along the margins of the intrusive and immediately beneath the rhyolite have been silicified  decalcified and sulfidized and  in and around the mineralized cells  have been extensively oxidized hypogene oxidation 
sediments also occur as xenoliths throughout the rhyolite and can be observed in outcrop and in subsurface 
the margins of the xenoliths are usually partially absorbed and most contacts are gradational 
early stage exploration properties in general  these properties either do not have sufficient work completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material or we do not have a significant controlling interest or joint venture on the property 
certain of these exploration properties have been optioned and leased to other exploration companies in return for production royalties averaging approximately advance minimum royalties and  on some of the properties  work commitments 
for the properties under lease  the lessee is typically responsible for making the land payments including the blm fees and county property tax payments 
blm filing fees and county property tax payments were paid for approximately  unpatented mining claims held by allied nevada 
we will pursue strategic options for the exploration properties that could include joint ventures  royalty agreements  or the sale or release of the mineral property
