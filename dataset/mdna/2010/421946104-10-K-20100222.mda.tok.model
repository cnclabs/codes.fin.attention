trends and matters impacting operating results management monitors factors and trends important to the company and reit industry in order to gauge the potential impact on the operations of the company 
discussed below are some of the factors and trends that management believes may impact future operations of the company 
as of december   approximately of the company s real estate investments consisted of properties leased to unaffiliated lessees pursuant to long term net lease agreements or subject to financial support agreements  approximately were multi tenanted properties with shorter term occupancy leases  and the remaining of investments were related to land held for development  corporate property  mortgage notes receivable and one investment in an unconsolidated joint venture which is invested in real estate properties 
the company s long term net leases and financial support agreements are generally designed to ensure the continuity of revenues and coverage of costs and expenses relating to the properties by the tenants and the sponsoring healthcare operators 
there is no assurance that the company s leases and financial support agreements will be extended past their expiration dates  which could impact the company s operating results as described in more detail below in expiring leases

also  the senior notes due  issued on december   bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and the mortgage debt 
table of contents due  entered into on november   bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the additional interest expense that the company will incur related to the new debt will have a negative impact on its future net income attributable to common stockholders  funds from operations  and cash flows

four of the properties  aggregating approximately million  were acquired by a joint venture in which the company has an controlling interest 
these acquisitions were funded with borrowings on the company s unsecured credit facilities  the assumption of existing mortgage debt  proceeds from real estate dispositions  and proceeds from various capital market financings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these acquisitions

the company expects completion of the core and shell of one project with a budget of approximately million during the second quarter of and expects completion of the core and shell of the second project with a budget of approximately million during the third quarter of the three medical office buildings that commenced operations during are currently in lease up  which generally takes two to three years before reaching stabilization

dispositions during  the company disposed of seven real estate properties for approximately million in net proceeds 
also  one mortgage note receivable totaling approximately million was repaid 
proceeds from these dispositions were used to repay amounts under the unsecured credit facility and to fund additional real estate investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these dispositions 
disposition in january  pursuant to a purchase option with an operator  the company disposed of five properties in virginia 
the company s aggregate net investment in the buildings was approximately million at december  the company received approximately million in net proceeds and million in lease termination fees 
the company expects to recognize a gain on sale of approximately million  including the write off of approximately million of straight line rent receivables 
purchase options as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  certain of the company s leases include purchase option provisions  which if exercised  could require the company to sell a property to a lessee or operator  which could have a negative impact on the company s future results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents expiring leases master leases on seven of the company s properties will expire during the company expects to extend the master lease on one of the properties 
for the remaining six properties  the company expects that it will not renew the master leases but will assume any tenant leases in the buildings and will manage the operations of those buildings 
the company also has leases in its multi tenanted buildings that will expire during  with each of the tenants occupying an average of approximately  square feet 
approximately of these leases  with each tenant occupying on average approximately  square feet  are related to leases located in on campus buildings  which traditionally have a high probability of renewal 
the expirations are widely distributed throughout the portfolio and are not concentrated with one tenant  health system or location 
with the expirations discussed above  the company expects there could be a short term negative impact to its results of operations  but anticipates that over time it will be able to re lease the properties or increase tenant rents to offset any short term decline in revenue 
discontinued operations as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  a company must present the results of operations of real estate assets disposed of or held for sale as discontinued operations 
therefore  the results of operations from such assets are classified as discontinued operations for the current period  and all prior periods presented are restated to conform to the current period presentation 
readers of the company s consolidated financial statements should be aware that each future disposal will result in a change to the presentation of the company s operations in the historical consolidated statements of income as previously filed 
such reclassifications to the consolidated statements of income will have no impact on previously reported net income attributable to common stockholders 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo and ffo per share are operating performance measures adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a reit s operating performance equal to net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
impairment charges may not be added back to net income attributable to common stockholders in calculating ffo  which have the effect of decreasing ffo in the period recorded 
the comparability of ffo for the three years ended december  was affected by the various acquisitions and dispositions of the company s real estate portfolio and the results of operations of the portfolio from period to period  as well as from the commencement of operations of properties that were previously under construction 
the comparability of ffo was also impacted by certain unusual items 
ffo for was favorably impacted by a re measurement gain totaling million  or per diluted common share  recognized in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interests in a joint venture 
ffo for was favorably impacted by the recognition of a net gain from certain repurchases of its senior notes due and its unsecured senior notes due the senior notes due totaling approximately million  or per diluted common share 
ffo for and was reduced by impairment charges recorded totaling million and million  or and  respectively  which reduced ffo for each of those years 
management believes ffo and ffo per share to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of the company s properties without giving effect to certain significant non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization expense 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
however  real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo and ffo per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods 
management uses ffo and ffo per share to compare and evaluate its own operating results from period to period  and to monitor the operating results of the company s peers in the reit industry 
the company reports ffo and ffo per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the reit industry and by industry analysts to evaluate reits and because ffo per share is consistently reported  discussed  and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about reits 
for these reasons  management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss ffo and ffo per share 
however  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common 
table of contents stockholders as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity

construction in progress and other commitments as of december   the company had two medical office buildings under construction with budgets totaling million and estimated completion dates in the second quarter of and the third quarter of at december   the company had million invested in construction in progress  including two parcels of land totaling million in land held for future development  and expects to fund million  million  and million in  and  respectively  on the two projects currently under construction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the company s construction in progress at december  the company also had various remaining first generation tenant improvement obligations budgeted as of december  totaling approximately million related to properties that were developed by the company 
in addition to the projects currently under construction  the company is financing the development of a six facility outpatient campus with a budget totaling approximately million 
the company has funded million towards the construction of four of the buildings 
the company s consolidated joint venture acquired three of the buildings and the fourth building was sold to a third party during these acquisitions are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
construction of the remaining two buildings has not yet begun  but the company expects to fund the remaining million during and the company s consolidated joint venture will have an option to purchase the two remaining buildings at a market price upon completion and full occupancy 
the company intends to fund these commitments with internally generated cash flows  proceeds from the unsecured credit facility  proceeds from the sale of real estate properties  proceeds from repayments of mortgage notes receivable  proceeds from secured debt  capital market financings  or private debt or equity offerings 
operating leases as of december   the company was obligated under operating lease agreements consisting primarily of the company s corporate office lease and ground leases related to real estate investments  excluding leases the company has prepaid 
these operating leases have expiration dates through rental expense relating to the operating leases for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
dividends the company is required to pay dividends to its stockholders at least equal to of its taxable income in order to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust 
common stock cash dividends paid during or related to are shown in the table below quarterly quarter dividend date of declaration date of record date paid payable th quarter february  february  march  st quarter may  may  june  nd quarter august  august  september  rd quarter november  november  december  th quarter february  february  march  the ability of the company to pay dividends is dependent upon its ability to generate funds from operations and cash flows and to make accretive new investments 

table of contents liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company s cash flows are dependent upon rental rates on leases  occupancy levels of the multi tenanted buildings  acquisition and disposition activity during the year  and the level of operating expenses  among other factors 
the company plans to continue to meet its liquidity needs  including funding additional investments in  paying dividends  and funding debt service  with cash flows from operations  borrowings under the unsecured credit facility  proceeds of mortgage notes receivable repayments  proceeds from sales of real estate investments  proceeds from secured debt borrowings  or additional capital market financings 
the company also had unencumbered real estate assets of approximately billion at december   which could serve as collateral for secured mortgage financing 
the company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements 
the company cannot  however  be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the company in sufficient amounts to meet its liquidity needs 
the company has some exposure to variable interest rates and its stock price has been impacted by the volatility in the stock markets 
however  the company s leases  which provide its main source of income and cash flow  are generally fixed in nature  have terms of approximately one to years and have lease rates that generally increase on an annual basis at fixed rates or based on consumer price indices 
impact of inflation inflation has not significantly affected the company s earnings due to the moderate inflation rate in recent years and the fact that most of the company s leases and financial support arrangements require tenants and sponsors to pay all or some portion of the increases in operating expenses  thereby reducing the company s risk to the adverse effects of inflation 
in addition  inflation has the effect of increasing gross revenue the company is to receive under the terms of certain leases and financial support arrangements 
leases and financial support arrangements vary in the remaining terms of obligations  further reducing the company s risk to any adverse effects of inflation 
interest payable under the unsecured credit facility is calculated at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the unsecured credit facility is influenced by changes in short term rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
during periods where interest rate increases outpace inflation  the company s operating results should be negatively impacted 
conversely  when increases in inflation outpace increases in interest rates  the company s operating results should be positively impacted 
new accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements provides a discussion of new accounting standards 
the company does not believe these new standards will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of changing interest rates on its debt and mortgage notes receivable 
management uses regular monitoring of market conditions and analysis techniques to manage this risk 
at december   approximately million  or  of the company s total debt  bore interest at fixed rates 
additionally  million of the company s mortgage notes and other notes receivable bore interest at fixed rates 
the following table provides information regarding the sensitivity of certain of the company s financial instruments  as described above  to market conditions and changes resulting from changes in interest rates 
for purposes of this analysis  sensitivity is demonstrated based on hypothetical changes in the underlying market interest rates

application of critical accounting policies to accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to exercise judgment and make assumptions that impact the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
management routinely evaluates the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
these regular evaluations consider historical experience and other reasonable factors and use the seasoned judgment of management personnel 
management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following paragraphs in this section describe the application of critical accounting policies by management to arrive at the critical accounting estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential for impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  including real estate properties  whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicates that the recorded value might not be fully recoverable 
important factors that could cause management to review for impairment include significant underperformance of an asset relative to historical or expected operating results  significant changes in the company s use of assets or the strategy for its overall business  plans to sell an asset before its depreciable life has ended  or significant negative economic trends or negative industry trends for the company or its operators 
in addition  the company reviews for possible impairment those assets subject to purchase options and those impacted by casualties  such as hurricanes 
if management determines that the carrying value of the company s assets may not be fully recoverable based on the existence of any of the factors above  or others  management would measure and record an impairment charge based on the estimated fair value of the property 
the company recorded impairments of million  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and related to real estate properties and other long lived assets 
the impairment charge in was recorded in connection with the sale of a property in washington 
the impairment charges in included million related to a long lived asset  million related to two properties sold in  and million related to two properties classified as held for sale in  reducing the company s carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values of the properties less costs to sell 
the impairment charges in included million recorded in connection with the sale of a property in texas and million related to six properties classified as held for sale as of december   reducing the company s carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values of the properties less costs to sell 
the company also performs an annual goodwill impairment review 
the company s reviews are performed as of december of each year 
the company s and reviews indicated that no impairment had occurred with the respect to the company s million goodwill asset 
capitalization of costs gaap generally allows for the capitalization of various types of costs 
the rules and regulations on capitalizing costs and the subsequent depreciation or amortization of those costs versus expensing them in the period incurred vary depending on the type of costs and the reason for capitalizing the costs 
direct costs of a development project generally include construction costs  professional services such as architectural and legal costs  travel expenses  land acquisition costs as well as other types of fees and expenses 
these costs are capitalized as part of the basis of an asset to which such costs relate 
indirect costs include capitalized interest and overhead costs 
the company s overhead costs are based on overhead load factors that are charged to a project based on direct time incurred 
the company computes the overhead load factors annually for its acquisition and development departments  which have employees who are involved in the projects 
the overhead load factors are computed to absorb that portion of indirect employee costs payroll and benefits  training  occupancy and similar costs that are attributable to the productive time the employee incurs working directly on projects 
the employees in the company s acquisitions and development departments who work on these projects maintain and report their hours daily  by project 
employee costs that are administrative  such as vacation time  sick time  or general and administrative time  are expensed in the period incurred 
acquisition related costs of an existing building include finder s fees  advisory  legal  accounting  valuation  other professional or consulting fees  and certain general and administrative costs 
these costs are also expensed in the period incurred 
management s judgment is also exercised in determining whether costs that have been previously capitalized to a project should be reserved for or written off if or when the project is abandoned or circumstances otherwise change that would call the project s viability into question 
the company follows a standard and consistently applied policy of classifying pursuit activity as well as reserving for these types of costs based on their classification 
the company classifies its pursuit projects into four categories  of which three relate to development and one relates to acquisitions 
the first category includes pursuits of developments that have a remote chance of producing new business 
costs for these projects are expensed in the period incurred 
the second category includes pursuits of developments that might reasonably be expected to produce new business opportunities although there can be no assurance that they will result in a new project or contract 
costs for these projects are capitalized but  due to the uncertainty of projects in this category  these costs are reserved at  which means that of the costs are expensed in the period incurred 
the third category includes those pursuits of developments that are either highly probable to result in a project or contract or already have resulted in a project or contract in which the contract requires the operator to reimburse the company s costs 
many times  these are pursuits involving operators with which the company is already doing business 
since the company believes it is probable that these pursuits will result in a project or contract  it capitalizes these costs in full and records no reserve 
the fourth category includes pursuits that involve the acquisition of existing buildings 
as discussed above  costs related to acquisitions of existing buildings are expensed in the period incurred 

table of contents each quarter  all capitalized pursuit costs are again reviewed carefully for viability or a change in classification  and a management decision is made as to whether any additional reserve is deemed necessary 
if necessary and considered appropriate  management would record an additional reserve at that time 
capitalized pursuit costs  net of the reserve  are carried in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and any reserve recorded is charged to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
all pursuit costs will ultimately be written off to expense or capitalized as part of the constructed real estate asset 
as of december  and  the company had capitalized pursuit costs totaling million and million  respectively  and had provided reserves against its capitalized pursuit costs of million and million  respectively 
depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of related intangible assets as of december   the company had investments of approximately billion in depreciable real estate assets and related intangible assets 
when real estate assets and related intangible assets are acquired or placed in service  they must be depreciated or amortized 
management s judgment involves determining which depreciation method to use  estimating the economic life of the building and improvement components of real estate assets  and estimating the value of intangible assets acquired when real estate assets are purchased that have in place leases 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  when the company acquires real estate properties with in place leases  the cost of the acquisition must be allocated between the acquired tangible real estate assets as if vacant and any acquired intangible assets 
such intangible assets could include above or below market in place leases and at market in place leases  which could include the opportunity costs associated with absorption period rentals  direct costs associated with obtaining new leases such as tenant improvements  and customer relationship assets 
any remaining excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill 
the identifiable tangible and intangible assets are then subject to depreciation and amortization 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis unless circumstances suggest that a more frequent evaluation is warranted 
if assumptions used to estimate the as if vacant value of the building or the intangible asset values prove to be inaccurate  the pro ration of the purchase price between building and intangibles and resulting depreciation and amortization could be incorrect 
the amortization period for the intangible assets is the average remaining term of the actual in place leases as of the acquisition date 
to help prevent errors in its estimates from occurring  management applies consistent assumptions with regard to the elements of estimating the as if vacant values of the building and the intangible assets  including the absorption period  occupancy increases during the absorption period  and tenant improvement amounts 
the company uses the same absorption period and occupancy assumptions for similar building types  adding the future cash flows expected to occur over the next years as a fully occupied building 
the net present value of these future cash flows  discounted using a market rate of return  becomes the estimated as if vacant value of the building 
with respect to the building components  there are several depreciation methods available under gaap 
some methods record relatively more depreciation expense on an asset in the early years of the asset s economic life  and relatively less depreciation expense on the asset in the later years of its economic life 
the straight line method of depreciating real estate assets is the method the company follows because  in the opinion of management  it is the method that most accurately and consistently allocates the cost of the asset over its estimated life 
the company assigns a useful life to its owned buildings based on many factors  including the age of the property when acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses many of the company s investments are subject to long term leases or other financial support arrangements with hospital systems and healthcare providers affiliated with the properties 
due to the nature of the company s agreements  the company s accounts receivable  notes receivable and interest receivables result mainly from monthly billings of contractual tenant rents  lease guaranty amounts  principal and interest payments due on notes and mortgage notes receivable  late fees and additional rent 
accounts receivable payments on the company s accounts receivable are normally collected within days of billing 
when receivables remain uncollected  management must decide whether it believes the receivable is collectible and whether to provide an allowance for all or a portion of these receivables 
unlike a financial institution with a large volume of homogeneous retail receivables such as credit card loans or automobile loans that have a predictable loss pattern over time  the company s receivable losses have historically been infrequent and are tied to a unique or specific event 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on specific identification and is recorded for a specific receivable amount once determined that such an allowance is needed 

table of contents management monitors the age and collectibility of receivables on an ongoing basis 
at least monthly  a report is produced whereby all receivables are aged or placed into groups based on the number of days that have elapsed since the receivable was billed 
management reviews the aging report for evidence of deterioration in the timeliness of payments from tenants  sponsors or borrowers 
whenever deterioration is noted  management investigates and determines the reason s for the delay  which may include discussions with the delinquent tenant  sponsor or borrower 
considering all information gathered  management s judgment must be exercised in determining whether a receivable is potentially uncollectible and  if so  how much or what percentage may be uncollectible 
among the factors management considers in determining uncollectibility are the following type of contractual arrangement under which the receivable was recorded  eg  a mortgage note  a triple net lease  a gross lease  a sponsor guaranty agreement or some other type of agreement  tenant s or debtor s reason for slow payment  industry influences and healthcare segment under which the tenant or debtor operates  evidence of willingness and ability of the tenant or debtor to pay the receivable  credit worthiness of the tenant or debtor  collateral  security deposit  letters of credit or other monies held as security  tenant s or debtor s historical payment pattern  other contractual agreements between the tenant or debtor and the company  relationship between the tenant or debtor and the company  state in which the tenant or debtor operates  and existence of a guarantor and the willingness and ability of the guarantor to pay the receivable 
considering these factors and others  management must conclude whether all or some of the aged receivable balance is likely uncollectible 
if management determines that some portion of a receivable is likely uncollectible  the company records a provision for bad debt expense for the amount expected to be uncollectible 
there is a risk that management s estimate is over or under stated  however  management believes that this risk is mitigated by the fact that it re evaluates the allowance at least once each quarter and bases its estimates on the most current information available 
as such  any over or under stated estimates in the allowance should be adjusted for as soon as new and better information becomes available 
mortgage notes and notes receivable the company also evaluates collectibility of its mortgage notes and notes receivable 
a loan is impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan as scheduled  including both contractual interest and principal payments 
the company did not record any provisions for doubtful accounts on its mortgage notes or notes receivable during or however  in connection with the sale of the senior living assets in  the company forgave approximately million in notes receivable which was reflected in the gain on sale in item a
