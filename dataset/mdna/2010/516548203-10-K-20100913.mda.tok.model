fiscal year financial highlights and other information a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fiscal year ended june  are as follows net revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the overall decrease in net revenues was a direct result of the economic downturn 
the decrease was primarily the result of a million  or  decrease in our device enablement product lines and a  or  decrease in our non core product lines  offset by a  or  increase in our device management product lines 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the fiscal year ended june  operating expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june  included restructuring charges of  net loss was million  or per basic and diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to  or per basic and diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june  net loss for the fiscal year ended june  included a restructurings charge of  cash and cash equivalents were million as of june  as compared to million as of june  net accounts receivable were million as of june  as compared to million as of june  annual days sales outstanding dso in receivables were days for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to days for the fiscal year ended june  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by the timing of shipments within a quarter  our collections performance and the fact that a significant portion of our revenues are recognized on a sell through basis upon shipment from distributor inventories rather than as goods are shipped to distributors 
net inventories were million as of june  as compared to million as of june  annual inventory turns were for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the fiscal year ended june  recent accounting pronouncements in september the fasb reached a consensus on accounting standards update  or asu   revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu and asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu asu modifies the requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
asu eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have either i vsoe or ii third party evidence  or tpe  before an entity can recognize the portion of overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the abse nce of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration has been eliminated 
asu modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
these new updates are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
any impact of these asus w ill be dependent on entering into new multiple element arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to net revenues  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  valuation of deferred income taxes  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  warranty reserves  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasona ble under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we do not recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
therefore  the recognition of net revenues and related cost of revenues from sales to distributors are deferred until the distributor resells the product 
net revenues from certain smaller distributors for which point of sale information is not available  is recognized approximately to days after the shipment date 
this estimate approximates the timing of the sale of the product by the distributor to the end user 
when product revenues are recognized  we establish an estimated allowance for future product returns based on historical returns experience  when price reductions are approved  we establish an estimated liability for price protection payable on inventories owned by product resellers 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  additional reductions to revenues would result 
our products typically carry a one or two year warranty 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs that differ from our estimates 
as a result  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
additionally  we sell extended warranty services  which extend the warranty period for an additional one to three years  depending upon the product 
warranty net revenues are recognized ratably over the warranty service period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported results 
we also maintain a reserve for uncertainties relative to the collection of former officer notes receivable 
factors considered in determining the level of this reserve include the value of the collateral securing the notes  our ability to effectively enforce collection rights and the ability of the former officers and lantronix directors to honor their obligations 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess and obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future sales demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally three to twelve months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
in addition  specific reserves are recorded to cover risks in the area of end of life products  inventory located at our contract manufacturers  deferred inventory in our sales channel and warranty replaceme nt stock 
if our sales forecast is less than the inventory we have on hand at the end of an accounting period  we may be required to take excess and obsolete inventory charges  which will decrease gross margin and net operating results for that period 
valuation of deferred income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero  primarily due to historical net operating losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would be required to reverse the valuation allowance that would be reflected as an income tax benefit at that time 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis  and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of our one reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of the reporting unit s fair value requires significant judgment and is based on management s best estimate  which generally uses valuation techniques based on multiples of revenue for similar companies and the company s market capitalization 
in addition  management may con sider the reporting unit s expected future earnings 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating fair value  we may be exposed to goodwill impairment losses 
as of march   the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be million based upon the company s market capitalization compared to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  of million 
as of june   we have million of goodwill reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate purchased intangible assets when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of these assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital is used to estimate the fair value of the assets 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipate d future net revenues  the remaining estimated economic lives of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of our purchased intangible assets 
in the event they are lower  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain purchased intangible assets could be required 
as of june   we have approximately  of purchased intangible assets reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net revenue by product line the following table presents net revenue by product line years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages device enablement device management device networking non core net revenue the overall decrease in net revenues was a result of the continued economic downturn 
the decrease was primarily the result of a million  or  decrease in our device enablement product lines and a  or  decrease in our non core product lines  offset by a  or  increase in our device management product lines 
the decrease in our device enablement product line was primarily due to a decrease in our external device enablement products  more specifically  our wibox  uds  xpress and mss product families 
to a lesser extent  the decrease in our device enablement product line was impacted by a decrease in our legacy embedded device enablement products  and more specifically  our micro  asic  and wiport product families  offset by an increase in our xport and matchport product famil ies 
the increase in our device management product line was the result of an increase in our slc and sls product families offset by a decrease in our slb and scs product families 
we are no longer investing in the development of our non core product lines and expect net revenue related to these products to continue to decline in the future as we focus our investment on our device networking product lines 
net revenues by geographic region the following table presents net revenues by geographic region years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages americas emea asia pacific net revenue the americas and emea geographic regions primarily contributed to the decrease in net revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in the americas region was primarily due to a decrease in our device enablement product lines  and more specifically  the wibox  mss  uds  micro  eds  and wiport product families offset by an increase in our xport and matchport product families and a decrease in our non core product lines  offset by an increase in our device management product lines  and more specifically  the slc and sls product families offset by a decrease in our slb and scs product families 
the decrease in our emea region was primarily due to a decrease in our device enablement product lines  and more specifically  the eds  uds  xpress  and xport product families and a decrease in our non core product lines  offset by an increase in our device management product lines  and more specifically  the slc and sls product families 
the increase in our asia pacific region was due to an increase in our device enablement product lines  and more specifically  the xport  uds and eds product lines and an increase in our non core product lines  offset by a decrease in our device management product lines  and more specifically  the slc product family

two international customers  transtec ag and barix ag  are related parties due to common ownership by our largest stockholder and lantronix director  bernhard bruscha 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of raw material components  subcontract labor assembly from contract manufacturers  manufacturing overhead  amortization of purchased intangible assets  establishing or relieving inventory reserves for excess and obsolete products or raw materials  warranty costs  royalties and share based compensation 
the following table presents gross profit years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages gross profit selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consisted of personnel related expenses including salaries and commissions  share based compensation  facility expenses  information technology  trade show expenses  advertising and professional legal and accounting fees offset by reimbursement of legal fees from insurance proceeds 
the following table presents selling  general and administrative expenses years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages personnel related expenses professional fees and outside services advertising and marketing facilities share based compensation depreciation other selling  general and administrative in order of significance  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to i a decrease in personnel related expenses and facilities as a result of a reduction in headcount from the prior year  ii a decrease in advertising and marketing expenses as a result of more focused spending and iii a decrease in professional fees and outside services due to cost cutting measures  offset by iv an increase in other as a result of an increase in state franchise tax fees 
research and development research and development expenses consisted of personnel related expenses including share based compensation  as well as expenditures to third party vendors for research and development activities 
the following table presents research and development expenses years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages personnel related expenses facilities professional fees and outside services share based compensation depreciation other research and development the increase in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  was mainly due to an increase in personnel related expenses and facilities related to a larger average headcount compared to other departments during fiscal and an increase in professional fees outside services for engineering projects 
restructuring charges the following table presents restructuring charges years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages restructuring charges during the first fiscal quarter ended september   we implemented a restructuring plan 
as part of the restructuring plan  employees from all ranks and across all functional groups of the company were terminated 
during the second fiscal quarter ended december   we incurred additional restructuring charges related to the termination of a senior level employee and the closure of a sales office in france 
during the third fiscal quarter ended march   we recognized a restructuring recovery of  for unused termination benefits and estimated payroll taxes 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june   we recognized a restructuring charge of  related to the consolidation of our corporate headquarters 
no restructuring charges were recognized during the fiscal year ended june  interest expense  net the following table presents interest expense  net years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages interest expense  net the decrease in interest expense  net  is primarily due to a reduction in the average balance of our term loan as a result of the ongoing monthly principal payments 
other income  net the following table presents other income  net years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages other income expense  net the change in other income expense  net  is primarily due to foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments related to our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar 
provision benefit for income taxes the following table presents the income tax provision benefit years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages provsion benefit for income taxes the following table presents our effective tax rate based upon our income tax provision years ended june  effective tax rate we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
the federal statutory rate was for all periods presented 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effect of our domestic losses recorded without a tax benefit  as well as the effect of foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal statutory rate 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
our practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
the following table summarizes our liability for uncertain tax positions years ended june  in thousands liability for uncertain tax positions accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions total liability as a result of our cumulative losses  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets for the fiscal years ended june  and the following table summarizes our net operating loss nol carryovers june  in thousands federal state our nol carryovers for federal and state income tax purposes begin to expire in fiscal years and  respectively 
at june   our fiscal through fiscal tax years remain open to examination by federal  state  and foreign taxing authorities 
however  we have nols beginning in fiscal which would cause the statute of limitations to remain open for the year in which the nol was incurred 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity since inception through fiscal  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock  a term loan and operating activities 
the following table presents details of our working capital and cash june  increase decrease in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents in order of significance  our working capital as of june  decreased  as compared to june  primarily due to i an increase in accounts payable as a result of the timing of inventory receipts and cash payments to vendors and ii an increase in other current liabilities and a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of an increase in deferred revenue at distributors compared to fiscal year ended june   offset by an increase in cash and an increase in our inventories as a result of an increase in inventory held by our distributors 
our cash balance increased from june  as a result of our cash management activities  which included the timing of cash payments to our vendors and the timing of cash receipts from our customers 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available from our line of credit will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash needs through at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our net revenue  research and development  expenses associated with any strategic partnerships or acquisitions and infrastructure investments  and expenses related to litigation  which could affect our ability to generate additional cash 
if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may need to raise capital by borrowing additional funds through bank loans  selling of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any su ch capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competition or continue to operate our business 
in august  we entered into amendment to line of credit  which provides for a three year million term loan and a two year million revolving credit facility the term loan and revolving credit facility or loan agreement 
the term loan was funded on august  and is payable in equal installments of principal and monthly accrued interest 
there are no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of the fiscal year end 
borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at the greater of or prime rate plus per annum 
if we achieve two consecutive quarters of positive ebitdas as defined in the loan agreement greater than  and only for so long as we maintain ebitdas greater than at the end of each subsequent fiscal quarter  then the borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at the greater of or prime rate plus per annum 
we paid a fully earned  non refundable commitment fee of  and paid an additional  on the first anniversary of the effective date  as defined in the loan agreement 
during august  we amended the loan agreement and extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to october  we are currently negotiating a new loan agreement 
the following table presents the balance outstanding on the term loan  our available borrowing capacity and outstanding letters of credit  which were used to secure equipment leases  deposits for a building lease  and security deposits june  in thousands term loan available borrowing capacity outstanding letters of credit as of june   approximately  of our cash was held in foreign subsidiary bank accounts 
this cash is unrestricted with regard to foreign liquidity needs  however  our ability to utilize a portion of this cash to satisfy liquidity needs outside of such foreign locations may be subject to approval by the foreign location board of directors 
cash flows the following table presents the major components of the consolidated statements of cash flows years ended june  in thousands net cash provided by used in net loss adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities accounts receivable inventories contract manufacturers receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets other assets accounts payable accrued payroll and related expenses warranty reserve restructuring reserve other liabilities cash received related to tenant incentives net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities provided cash during the fiscal year ended june  this was the result of cash provided by operating assets and liabilities and non cash operating expenses offset by a net loss
