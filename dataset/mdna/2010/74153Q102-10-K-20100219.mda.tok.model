item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with financial statement and supplementary data in item of this annual report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements below 
overview we are one of the world s largest offshore drilling contractors 
as of february   we operated a fleet of rigs  consisting of two deepwater drillships  semisubmersible rigs  seven independent leg jackups and two managed deepwater drilling rigs 
we also have four deepwater drillships under construction 
our customers include major integrated oil and natural gas companies  state owned national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas companies 
our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling services to smaller companies focused on more specific geographic or technological areas 
we are continuing to increase our emphasis on deepwater drilling 
although crude oil prices have declined from the record levels reached in mid  we believe the long term prospects for deepwater drilling are positive given that the expected growth in oil consumption from developing nations  limited growth in crude oil supplies and high depletion rates of mature oil fields  together with geologic successes  improving access to promising offshore areas and new  more efficient technologies  will continue to be catalysts for the long term exploration and development of deepwater fields 
since  we have invested or committed to invest over billion in the expansion of our deepwater fleet  including four new ultra deepwater drillships under construction 
three of the drillships have multi year contracts at favorable rates  with two scheduled to work in the strategically important deepwater us gulf of mexico  which  in addition to our operations in brazil and west africa  provides us with exposure to all three of the world s most active deepwater basins 
since  we also have disposed of non core assets  generating billion in proceeds  enabling us to increasingly focus our financial and human capital on deepwater drilling 
in addition  on august   we completed the spin off of seahawk drilling  inc  which holds the assets and liabilities that were associated with our mat supported jackup rig business 
our customers reduced exploration and development spending in  especially in midwater and shallow water drilling programs  due to the economic downturn and decline in crude oil prices 
we anticipate that deepwater activity will outperform other drilling sectors due to the longer nature of deepwater field development  more favorable drilling economics and the tendency for deepwater drilling programs to be more insulated to short term commodity price fluctuations 
an increasing focus on deepwater prospects by national oil companies  whose activities are less sensitive to general economic factors  serve to provide further stability in the deepwater sector 
our contract backlog at december  totals billion and is comprised primarily of contracts for deepwater rigs with large integrated oil and national oil companies possessing long term development plans 
our backlog  together with our existing cash on hand and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility  are expected to provide sufficient financial resources to meet existing obligations through the current economic global uncertainty 
recent developments spin off of mat supported jackup business on august   we completed the spin off of seahawk  which holds the assets and liabilities that were associated with our mat supported jackup rig business 
in the spin off  our stockholders received approximately million shares of the outstanding common stock of seahawk by way of a pro rata stock dividend 
each of our stockholders of record at the close of business on august  received one share of seahawk common stock for every shares of our common stock held by such stockholder and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of seahawk common stock to which such stockholder otherwise would have been entitled 
in connection with the spin off  we made a cash contribution to seahawk of approximately million to achieve a targeted working capital for seahawk as of may  of million 
we and seahawk also agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities that may arise or be incurred in the future attributable to our respective businesses 
issuance of senior notes due on june   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we are using the net proceeds from the offering of million for general corporate purposes  which include payments with respect to our four drillships under construction and other capital expenditures 
contract termination in march  we accelerated a planned inspection on our midwater semisubmersible pride venezuela 
the rig had been working offshore angola 
an inspection of a section of the rig s hull revealed an unacceptable level of corrosion  which required a dry dock facility to conduct the repairs 
the hull repairs  along with other maintenance and repairs to the rig  were expected to require most of the remaining term of the rig s then existing contract  which had been expected to conclude in march consequently  in may we and the customer mutually agreed to the termination of the remaining term of the contract 
the rig was mobilized to a shipyard in dubai for further evaluation and completion of a rig refurbishment project 
the rig refurbishment project was initiated in december and includes significant steel replacement and refurbishment of drilling and other rig equipment 
we expect the project to be completed during the second quarter of investments in deepwater fleet in january  we entered into a five year contract with respect to the deep ocean mendocino  our drillship under construction with a scheduled delivery in the first quarter of the drilling contract is expected to commence in the second quarter of following the completion of shipyard construction  mobilization of the rig to an initial operating location and customer acceptance testing 
the construction agreement with the shipyard provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
including amounts already paid  commissioning and testing  we expect the total project cost to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
through december   we have spent approximately million on this construction project 
in january  we entered into a five year contract for drilling operations in the us gulf of mexico with respect to the deep ocean ascension  our drillship under construction  which we acquired from lexton shipping ltd 
scheduled delivery of this rig is in the first quarter of work on the client s behalf is expected to commence mid following the completion of shipyard construction  mobilization of the rig to the us gulf of mexico and customer acceptance testing 
in connection with the contract  the drillship is being modified from the original design to provide enhanced capabilities designed to allow our clients to conduct subsea construction activities and other simultaneous activities  while drilling or completing the well 
the construction agreement with the shipyard provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
including the above mentioned modifications  amounts already paid  commissioning and testing  we expect the total project cost to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
through december   we have spent approximately million on this construction project 
in april  we entered into a five year contract with respect to the deep ocean clarion  our drillship under construction with a scheduled delivery in the third quarter of the drilling contract is expected to commence in the beginning of the first quarter of following the completion of shipyard construction  mobilization of the rig to an initial operating location and customer acceptance testing 
in connection with the contract  the drillship is being modified from the original design to provide enhanced capabilities designed to allow our clients to conduct subsea construction activities and other simultaneous activities  while drilling or completing the well 
the construction agreement with the shipyard provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
including the above mentioned modifications  amounts already paid  commissioning and testing  we expect the total project cost to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
through december   we have spent approximately million on this construction project 
also  while we have previously purchased a license to equip the rig for dual activity use  the rig will not initially be functional as a dual activity rig  but can be modified to add this functionality in the future 
in august  we entered into an agreement for the construction of a fourth ultra deepwater drillship  named deep ocean molokai to be delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the agreement provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
we have the right to rescind the contract for delays exceeding certain periods and the right to liquidated damages for delays during certain periods 
through december   we have spent approximately million on this construction project 
including commissioning and testing  we expect the total project cost to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
although we currently do not have a drilling contract for this drillship  we expect that the anticipated long term demand for deepwater drilling capacity in established and emerging basins should provide us with a number of opportunities to contract the rig prior to its delivery date 
there are risks of delay inherent in any major shipyard project  including work stoppages  disputes  financial and other difficulties encountered by the shipyard  and adverse weather conditions 
for our ultra deepwater drillships under construction  we have attempted to mitigate risks of delay by selecting the same shipyard for all four construction projects with fixed fee contracts  although some of the other risks are more concentrated 
dispositions in february  we completed the sale of our fleet of three self erecting  tender assist rigs for million in cash 
we operated one of the rigs until mid april  when we transitioned the operations of that rig to the owner 
in may  we sold our entire fleet of platform rigs and related land  buildings and equipment for million in cash 
in connection with the sale  we entered into lease agreements with the buyer to operate two platform rigs until their existing contracts are completed 
in march  the contract for one of these rigs was canceled and the rig was subsequently transitioned to the buyer at the beginning of april a contract extension was granted for the remaining rig  which we continued to operate until the spin off of seahawk in august as this contract was included in seahawk s business 
the leases required us to pay to the buyer all revenues from the operation of the rigs  less operating costs and a small per day management fee  which we retained 
in july  we entered into agreements to sell our eastern hemisphere land rig business  which constituted our only remaining land drilling operations  for million in cash 
the sale of all but one of the rigs closed in the fourth quarter of we leased the remaining rig to the buyer until the sale of that rig closed  which occurred in the second quarter of we have reclassified the historical results of operations of our former latin america land and e p services segments  three tender assist rigs  eastern hemisphere land rig operations and mat supported jackup business to discontinued operations 
unless noted otherwise  the discussion and analysis that follows relates to our continuing operations only 
loss of pride wyoming in september  the pride wyoming  a foot slot type jackup rig owned by seahawk and operating in the us gulf of mexico  was deemed a total loss for insurance purposes after it was severely damaged and sank as a result of hurricane ike 
all proceeds related to the insured value of the rig were received in costs for removal of the wreckage are expected to be covered by our insurance 
under the master separation agreement between us and seahawk  seahawk will be responsible for any removal costs  legal settlements and legal costs associated with the pride wyoming not covered by insurance 
at seahawk s request  we will be required to finance  on a revolving basis  all of the costs for removal of the wreckage and salvage operations until receipt of insurance proceeds 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this arrangement 
fcpa investigation during the course of an internal audit and investigation relating to certain of our latin american operations  our management and internal audit department received allegations of improper payments to foreign government officials 
in february  the audit committee of our board of directors assumed direct responsibility over the investigation and retained independent outside counsel to investigate the allegations  as well as corresponding accounting entries and internal control issues  and to advise the audit committee 
the investigation has found evidence suggesting that payments  which may violate the us foreign corrupt practices act  were made to government officials in venezuela and mexico aggregating less than million 
the evidence to date regarding these payments suggests that payments were made beginning in early through a to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials for the purpose of extending drilling contracts for two jackup rigs and one semisubmersible rig operating offshore venezuela  and b to one or more government officials  or to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials  for the purpose of collecting payment for work completed in connection with offshore drilling contracts in venezuela 
in addition  the evidence suggests that other payments were made beginning in through early a to one or more government officials in mexico in connection with the clearing of a jackup rig and equipment through customs  the movement of personnel through immigration or the acceptance of a jackup rig under a drilling contract  and b with respect to the potentially improper entertainment of government officials in mexico 
the audit committee  through independent outside counsel  has undertaken a review of our compliance with the fcpa in certain of our other international operations 
this review has found evidence suggesting that during the period from through payments were made directly or indirectly to government officials in saudi arabia  kazakhstan  brazil  nigeria  libya  angola and the republic of the congo in connection with clearing rigs or equipment through customs or resolving outstanding issues with customs  immigration  tax  licensing or merchant marine authorities in those countries 
in addition  this review has found evidence suggesting that in payments were made to one or more third parties with the intent that they would be transferred to a government official in india for the purpose of resolving a customs dispute related to the importation of one of our jackup rigs 
the evidence suggests that the aggregate amount of payments referred to in this paragraph is less than million 
in addition  the us department of justice doj has asked us to provide information with respect to a our relationships with a freight and customs agent and b our importation of rigs into nigeria 
the investigation of the matters described above and the audit committee s compliance review are substantially complete 
our management and the audit committee of our board of directors believe it likely that then members of our senior operations management either were aware  or should have been aware  that improper payments to foreign government officials were made or proposed to be made 
our former chief operating officer resigned as chief operating officer effective on may  and has elected to retire from the company  although he will remain an employee  but not an officer  until the completion of the investigation and related matters to assist us with the investigation and to be available for consultation and to answer questions relating to our business 
his retirement benefits will be subject to the determination by our audit committee or our board of directors that it does not have cause as defined in his retirement agreement with us to terminate his employment 
other personnel  including officers  have been terminated or placed on administrative leave or have resigned in connection with the investigation 
we have taken and will continue to take disciplinary actions where appropriate and various other corrective action to reinforce our commitment to conducting our business ethically and legally and to instill in our employees our expectation that they uphold the highest levels of honesty  integrity  ethical standards and compliance with the law 
we voluntarily disclosed information relating to the initial allegations and other information found in the investigation and compliance review to the doj and the sec  and we have cooperated and continue to cooperate with these authorities 
for any violations of the fcpa  we may be subject to fines  civil and criminal penalties  equitable remedies  including profit disgorgement  and injunctive relief 
civil penalties under the antibribery provisions of the fcpa could range up to  per violation  with a criminal fine up to the greater of million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others  if larger 
civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the fcpa can range up to  per violation and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to million per violation 
in addition  both the sec and the doj could assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts 
often  dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly a monitor being appointed to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the fcpa 
we are engaged in discussions with the doj and the sec regarding a potential negotiated resolution of these matters  which could be settled during and which  as described above  could involve a significant payment by us 
we believe that it is likely that any settlement will include both criminal and civil sanctions 
we have accrued million in anticipation of a possible resolution with the doj and the sec of potential liabilities under the fcpa 
this accrual represents our best estimate of potential fines  penalties and disgorgement related to such resolution 
for tax purposes  fines and penalties are not deductible 
the monetary sanctions ultimately paid by us to resolve these issues  whether imposed on us or agreed to by settlement  may exceed the amount of the accrual 
there can be no assurance that our discussions with the doj and sec will result in a final settlement of any or all of these issues or  if a settlement is reached  the timing of any such settlement or that the terms of any such settlement would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we could also face fines  sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions  including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets 
our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests 
we could also face other third party claims by directors  officers  employees  affiliates  advisors  attorneys  agents  stockholders  debt holders  or other interest holders or constituents of our company 
for additional information regarding a stockholder demand letter with respect to these matters  please see the discussion under demand letter in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
in addition  disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients  to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets 
while we have made an accrual in anticipation of a possible resolution with the doj and sec as discussed above  no amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines  sanctions  claims or other penalties referenced in this paragraph  which could be material individually or in the aggregate 
although  as discussed above  we are currently in discussions with the doj and the sec regarding a possible resolution of potential liability under the fcpa  we cannot currently predict what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj  the sec  any other applicable government or other authorities or our customers or other third parties or the effect the actions may have on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  on our consolidated financial statements or on our business in the countries at issue and other jurisdictions 
our business we provide contract drilling services to major integrated  government owned and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world 
our drilling fleet competes on a global basis  as offshore rigs generally are highly mobile and may be moved from one region to another in response to demand 
while the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary somewhat between regions  significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility 
key factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a contract include pricing  safety performance and operations competency 
rig availability  location and technical ability can also be key factors in the determination 
currently  all of our drilling contracts with our customers are on a dayrate basis  where we charge the customer a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well 
we provide the rigs and drilling crews and are responsible for the payment of rig operating and maintenance expenses 
our customer bears the economic risk and benefit relative to the geologic success of the wells to be drilled 
the markets for our drilling services have historically been highly cyclical 
our operating results are significantly affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas companies exploration and development drilling programs drive the demand for drilling services 
these drilling programs are affected by a number of factors  including oil and natural gas companies expectations regarding crude oil and natural gas prices 
some drilling programs are influenced by short term expectations  such as shallow water drilling programs in the us gulf of mexico and the middle east  while others  especially deepwater drilling programs  are typically subject to a longer term view of crude oil prices 
other drivers include anticipated production levels  worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas products and many other factors 
access to quality drilling prospects  exploration success  availability of qualified rigs and operating personnel  relative production costs  availability and lead time requirements for drilling and production equipment  the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect our customers drilling programs 
crude oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile  which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by our customers for oil and natural gas drilling services 
variations in market conditions during the cycle impact us in different ways depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different regions 
for example  contracts for jackup rigs in certain shallow water markets are shorter term  so a deterioration or improvement in market conditions tends to quickly impact revenues and cash flows from those operations 
contracts in deepwater and other international offshore markets tend to be longer term  so a change in market conditions tends to have a delayed impact 
accordingly  short term changes in market conditions may have minimal impact on revenues and cash flows from those operations unless the timing of contract renewals takes place during the short term changes in the market 
our revenues depend principally upon the number of our available rigs  the number of days these rigs are utilized and the contract dayrates received 
the number of days our rigs are utilized and the contract dayrates received are largely dependent upon the balance of supply of drilling rigs and demand for drilling services for the different rig classes we operate  as well as our rigs operational performance  including mechanical efficiency 
the number of rigs we have available may increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  the construction of new rigs  the number of rigs being upgraded or repaired or undergoing standard periodic surveys or routine maintenance at any time and the number of rigs idled during periods of oversupply in the market or when we are unable to contract our rigs at economical rates 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher contract dayrates  we may mobilize our rigs from one geographic region to another for which we may receive a mobilization fee from the client 
the mobilization fee is intended to cover the cost of moving the rig and  during periods when rigs are in short supply  may provide revenues in excess of the cost to mobilize the unit 
mobilization fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the drilling contract 
we organize our reportable segments based on the water depth operating capabilities of our drilling rigs 
our reportable segments include deepwater  which consists of our rigs capable of drilling in water depths of  feet and greater  midwater  which consists of our semisubmersible rigs capable of drilling in water depths of  feet or less  and independent leg jackups  which consists of our rigs capable of operating in water depths up to feet 
we also manage the drilling operations for deepwater rigs  which are included in a non reported operating segment along with corporate costs and other operations 
our earnings from operations are primarily affected by revenues  utilization of our fleet and the cost of labor  repairs  insurance and maintenance 
many of our drilling contracts covering multiple years allow us to adjust the dayrates charged to our customer based on changes in operating costs  such as increases in labor costs  maintenance and repair costs and insurance costs 
some of our costs are fixed in nature or do not vary at the same time or to the same degree as changes in revenue 
for instance  if a rig is expected to be idle between contracts and earn no revenue  we may maintain our rig crew  which reduces our earnings as we cannot fully offset the impact of the lost revenues with reductions in operating costs 
in addition  some drilling contracts provide for the payment of bonus revenues  representing a percentage of the rig s contract dayrate and based on the rig meeting defined operations performance during a period 
our industry has traditionally been affected by shortages of  and competition for  skilled rig crew personnel during periods of high levels of activity 
even as overall industry activity declines  we expect these personnel shortages to continue  especially in the deepwater segment  due to the number of newbuild deepwater rigs expected to be delivered through and the need for highly skilled personnel to operate these rigs 
to better retain and attract skilled rig personnel  we offer competitive compensation programs and have increased our focus on training and management development programs 
labor costs continued to increase in  especially for skilled personnel in certain geographic locations  although the more challenging business environment characterized by reduced offshore activity slowed the rate of increase of such costs during the year 
labor costs are expected to increase further in  most notably in the deepwater segment 
beginning in  demand for contract drilling services experienced a significant increase  resulting in increased demand for oilfield equipment and spare parts 
this increased demand  when coupled with the consolidation of equipment suppliers  resulted in longer order lead times to obtain critical spares and other critical equipment components essential to our business  along with higher repair and maintenance costs and longer out of service time for major repair and upgrade projects 
we maintain higher levels of critical spares in an effort to minimize unplanned downtime 
with the decline in prices during for steel and other key inputs and the decline in the level of business activity  we believe that some softening of lead times and pricing for spare parts and equipment is possible for the foreseeable future 
the amount and timing of such softening will be affected by our suppliers level of backlog and the number of remaining newbuilds  which are expected to increase in due especially to expanding deepwater rig needs in brazil 
the decline in crude oil prices that began in late  following the onset of the global financial crisis  deteriorating global economic fundamentals and the resulting decline in crude oil demand in a number of the world s largest oil consuming nations  had a negative impact in on customer demand for offshore rigs 
crude oil prices averaged approximately per barrel during compared to per barrel in the lower price along with the uncertainty of prices in the near term contributed heavily to a significant reduction in planned offshore drilling expenditures by our customers 
worldwide offshore fleet utilization declined to its lowest level since early  to approximately at december  as compared to at december  this decline was more pronounced in exploration activities  which are by their nature shorter term projects 
deepwater drilling activity displayed more resilience during the more challenging business environment in relative to other offshore drilling activities  especially for projects currently in a development phase 
this is due to the long term planning horizon common among our customers when engaged in deepwater development programs 
utilization for the industry s deepwater fleet has historically been less sensitive to the extreme fluctuations as experienced within the shallow water market even during market downturns 
although crude oil prices during early have at times closed above per barrel  representing a better than improvement since declining to a low of per barrel in february  many clients remain cautious in early regarding offshore spending and are postponing some drilling programs to later years while others continue to engage in subletting of rigs in an effort to reduce their capital commitments during a period of price uncertainty 
historically  greater confidence by our customers in a sustainable range for crude oil prices has led to increased exploration and production spending  creating a stronger environment for offshore drilling services 
crude oil prices have remained above per barrel since august and have averaged per barrel from may through january we believe a business environment characterized by increased price sustainability above per barrel should lead to increased client exploration and production spending in relative to spending levels in however  the timing of the increased spending may not be evident until improvement in oil market fundamentals are present  including stronger evidence of global economic expansion and reviving crude oil demand 
we believe that long term market conditions for offshore drilling services are supported by sound fundamental factors and that demand should produce attractive opportunities for our deepwater rigs  including those units under construction 
we expect the long term global demand for deepwater contract drilling services to be driven by the return of expanding worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas as global economic growth returns  an increased focus by oil and natural gas companies on deepwater offshore prospects  and increased global participation by national oil companies 
customer requirements for deepwater drilling capacity have grown since  as the successful results in exploration drilling conducted over the past several years have led to numerous prolonged field development programs around the world  placing deepwater assets in limited supply through we believe that positive long term economic trends and increased demand for crude oil will lead to a sustainable trading range for crude oil prices in the future and increased exploration and production spending 
should recent global economic trends continue to strengthen  providing support for improving crude oil price fundamentals  we believe spending by our clients will increase in relative to spending levels 
a recent survey of global integrated  independent and national oil companies conducted by barclays capital concluded that total exploration and production spending in could increase by compared to an estimated decline during in addition  the survey estimates that of respondents expect to increase the share of total offshore spending dedicated to deepwater drilling in geological successes in exploratory markets  such as the numerous discoveries to date in the pre salt formation offshore brazil  the lower tertiary trend in the us gulf of mexico and deeper waters offshore angola  along with the continued development of a number of deepwater projects in each of these regions  are expected to produce growing demand from clients for deepwater rigs 
during  clients announced a record deepwater discoveries covering an expanding number of offshore basins  such as ghana and sierra leone  further supporting the long term sustainability of deepwater drilling demand 
in addition  international oil companies are experiencing greater access to other promising areas offshore  such as india  malaysia  australia  mexico and the black sea 
the combination of drilling successes  greater access to offshore basins and continued advances in offshore technology which support increased efficiency in field development efforts  including parallel drilling activities  are expected to further support the improving long term outlook for deepwater rig demand 
our deepwater fleet currently operates in brazil  west africa and the mediterranean sea  and we expect to increase the breadth of our operations in the strategically important us gulf of mexico region in with the delivery of the deep ocean ascension and deep ocean clarion  two of our four deepwater drillships currently under construction 
including rig days for our drillships under construction  based upon their scheduled delivery dates  we have of our available rig days for our deepwater fleet contracted in  in  in and in since a steady increase in customer demand for deepwater drilling rigs began in  substantially all of the industry s fleet of units capable of operating in water depths of  feet and greater remained under contract through  the beneficiaries of large contract backlogs 
the high customer demand led to a steep rise in deepwater rig dayrates  which peaked above  per day for some multi year contracts awarded in although declines in dayrates have occurred from peak levels  dayrates for deepwater rigs capable of drilling in greater than  feet of water and available in have remained above  per day 
these dayrates have been supported by strong geologic success  especially in brazil  west africa  the us gulf of mexico  and in some of the new and emerging deepwater regions  which has led to a growing number of commercial discoveries 
the drilling success has been most notable offshore brazil  where exploration drilling in the country s prolific subsalt formation has found numerous crude oil deposits of significant size residing in up to  feet of water in the santos basin 
the successful drilling results and aggressive exploration calendar have resulted in an announced billion increase in planned exploration and production expenditures by petrobras  the national oil company of brazil  to an estimated billion between through to support development of the subsalt formation and other global interests 
the expansion includes the need for up to incremental deepwater rigs to be deployed in the numerous subsalt fields discovered to date  with of the incremental rig needs offered to international contract drillers 
we are currently evaluating the opportunity to participate in the deepwater expansion offshore brazil  but have not currently reached a conclusion regarding the balance between appropriate return criteria and numerous risk factors associated with the expansion program  including a requirement that all of the deepwater assets be constructed by shipyards in brazil 
a similar subsalt geologic trend has been identified offshore west africa  which could lead to increased deepwater drilling in the future 
in addition  deepwater drilling economics have been aided in recent years by an expectation of higher average crude oil prices  supported by global economic expansion and an increased number of deepwater discoveries containing large volumes of hydrocarbons 
these improving factors associated with deepwater activity have produced a growing base of development programs requiring multiple years to complete and resulting in long term contract awards by our customers  especially for projects in the three traditional deepwater basins  and represents a significant portion of our revenue backlog that currently extends into although we believe the deepwater segment has experienced a period of long term global expansion that could continue for several years  the onset of the global financial crisis in has caused some of our clients to postpone deepwater exploration and development plans  reducing the urgency to contract deepwater rigs in the near term 
many customers are reassessing offshore exploration plans and re evaluating a number of planned deepwater development projects in reaction to a period of increased global economic uncertainty 
certain customers have excess rig capacity and are attempting to sublease this capacity to other customers 
some deepwater capacity became available during the second half of as a result of operators reluctance to contract rigs in the near term and an increased sensitivity to the cost of rig services in an uncertain oil price environment  leading to a decline in dayrates 
the lower utilization and dayrate decline is most pronounced among the conventionally moored deepwater semisubmersibles  which generally have the ability to operate in water depths of  to  feet and employ less sophisticated features 
dayrates for rigs of this technical specification have weakened and are expected to experience further weakness during as a growing number of rigs complete contracts ahead of an expected acceleration in customer spending 
although clients have shown a preference toward rigs with advanced capabilities  including dynamic positioning and parallel well construction and field development features  dayrates for these advanced deepwater rigs could experience declines from levels seen in should clients continue to delay the commencement of large development programs to later years at a time when deepwater capacity is increasing  particularly in and when as many as uncommitted deepwater rigs are expected to complete construction programs and enter the active fleet 
also  customers could engage in further subleasing activity  which would intensify the level of competition for deepwater drilling opportunities  leading to further pricing pressure 
a strengthening dayrate environment for advanced deepwater rigs is expected to emerge beyond or  supported by improving global economic activity which should lead to sound crude oil fundamentals  the commencement of new multi year field development programs  continued successful exploration results and the global expansion of deepwater drilling programs 
our midwater fleet currently operates offshore africa and brazil  and we expect this geographic presence to remain unchanged through we currently have of our available rig days for our midwater fleet contracted in  in  in and in customer needs for midwater rigs declined in  resulting in periods of inactivity for some rigs 
subleasing of rigs by clients increased due to the uncertain economic climate  increased difficulty with accessing capital resources and a desire by many clients to reduce capital expenditures to a level which approximated projected cash flows in the year 
midwater rig availability steadily increased in  with rigs idle worldwide at december   including our semisubmersible pride south seas  compared to nine rigs at december   leading to a more challenging dayrate environment 
the deteriorating midwater segment fundamentals are due in part to the developing weakness in the deepwater rig segment for conventionally moored deepwater rigs  in which these more capable rigs are forced to bid reduced dayrates on work programs in shallower water depths in an attempt to remain active  thereby eliminating a contract opportunity that may have otherwise been available to a midwater unit 
also  many of the industry s midwater rigs are utilized in mature offshore regions that are sensitive to crude oil price volatility  such as the uk north sea 
although four rigs are currently idle in the uk north sea  these units are not expected to migrate to other regions to secure work due to the high cost of returning to the north sea at some future point 
finally  the number of midwater rigs located in the us gulf of mexico has declined significantly from rigs in to three rigs at december   due primarily to the risk of mooring system failures during hurricane season  marginal geologic prospects and more attractive opportunities in other regions  such as brazil 
contract opportunities for midwater rigs with availability over the next months currently remain limited  with most contract opportunities characterized by short durations of six months or less 
this more challenging environment is expected to lead to an increasing risk of additional idle capacity  as contracts are expected to conclude on approximately of the industry s midwater rigs  leading to further deterioration in utilization and dayrates 
we expect this outlook to persist until our customers gain further confidence in improving near term global crude oil fundamentals  resulting in increased predictability regarding crude oil prices 
our independent leg jackup rig fleet currently operates in the middle east  asia pacific and west africa 
we currently have of our available rig days for our independent leg jackup fleet contracted in  in  and no available rig days contracted beyond the addition of new jackup rig capacity in the industry represents a long term threat to the segment 
since  jackup rigs have been added to the global fleet  with another expected to be added by the end of at present  of the expected new build jackups deliveries have failed to obtain an initial contract award following the completion of construction and are idle in various shipyards in the far east 
the majority of rigs being delivered in and beyond are without contracts 
customer demand for jackup rigs declined steadily in while contract backlogs fell throughout the industry s existing fleet of rigs and incremental capacity surged 
as of december   rigs were idle in the worldwide fleet  representing segment utilization of  compared to rigs idle at december  dayrates for standard international class jackup rigs peaked during and fell throughout and as the utilization rate declined to current levels 
although client inquiries and tenders have improved somewhat during late and into  we expect jackup utilization and dayrates to trend lower in the near to intermediate term as existing jackup rigs complete contracts and new capacity is added to the global supply at a time when customers in the middle east  west africa and asia continue to reassess offshore drilling programs 
aggregate jackup rig needs in mexico were expected to increase during as petroleos mexicanos pemex launched new offshore drilling programs  but these potential needs have been postponed indefinitely  resulting in a number of rigs going idle in the region 
we experienced approximately out of service days for shipyard maintenance and upgrade projects for the year ended december   for our existing fleet as compared to approximately days for the year ended december  backlog our backlog at december   totaled approximately billion for our executed contracts  with billion attributable to our deepwater drillships under construction 
we expect approximately billion of our total backlog to be realized in our backlog at december  was approximately billion 
we calculate our backlog  or future contracted revenue for our offshore fleet  as the contract dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining on the contract  assuming full utilization 
backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation  customer reimbursables and performance bonuses 
the amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amount disclosed or expected due to various factors 
downtime due to various operating factors  including unscheduled repairs  maintenance  weather and other factors  may result in lower applicable dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate  as well as the ability of our customers to terminate contracts under certain circumstances 
the following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of december  the percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under firm contracts  as well as scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days  to total available days in the period 
total available days have been calculated based on the expected delivery dates for our four deepwater rigs under construction 
for the years ending december  rig days committed deepwater midwater independent leg jackups critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and  accordingly  these estimates may change as additional information is obtained  as more experience is acquired  as our operating environment changes and as new events occur 
our critical accounting estimates are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult  subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements  which could be material  if we used different assumptions or estimates 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for property and equipment  income taxes and contingent liabilities 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation 
property and equipment property and equipment comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we determine the carrying value of these assets based on property and equipment policies that incorporate our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to the carrying value  remaining useful lives and salvage value of our rigs 
we depreciate our property and equipment over the estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives of our rigs reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of estimated useful lives  especially those involving our rigs  would likely result in materially different net book values of our property and equipment and results of operations 
useful lives of rigs and related equipment are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and natural gas exploration and development  changes in market or economic conditions and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the rig and include changes in operating condition  functional capability and market and economic factors 
we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long term impact of those upgrades on the future marketability when assessing the useful lives of individual rigs 
during we had no adjustments to the useful lives of the rigs 
during  we reviewed the useful lives of certain rigs upon completion of shipyard projects  which resulted in extending the useful lives of the rigs  and as a result reduced depreciation expense by million and million for continuing and discontinued operations  respectively  and increased after tax diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 
during  we completed a technical evaluation of our offshore fleet 
as a result of our evaluation  we increased our estimates of the remaining lives of certain semisubmersible and jackup rigs in our fleet between four and eight years  increased the expected useful lives of our drillships from years to years and our semisubmersibles from years to years  and updated our estimated salvage value for all of our offshore drilling rig fleet to of the historical cost of the rigs 
the effect for of these changes in estimates was a reduction to depreciation expense of approximately million and million for continuing and discontinued operations  respectively  and an after tax increase to diluted earnings per share of and for continuing and discontinued operations  respectively 
we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include i extended periods of idle time and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets  ii a significant adverse change in business climate  such as a decline in our market value or fleet utilization  or iii an adverse change in the manner or physical condition of a group of assets or a specific asset 
however  the drilling industry is highly cyclical and it is not unusual to find that assets that were idle  under utilized or contracted at sub economic rates for significant periods of time resume activity at economic rates when market conditions improve 
additionally  our rigs are mobile  and we may mobilize rigs from one market to another to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates 
we monitor our recorded asset values every quarter to determine if there has been a triggering event that may result in impairment to any of our assets 
as of december   we determined that we had no triggering event and no impairment to any of our rigs 
we use estimated future undiscounted cash flow analyses to determine whether the carrying values of our assets are recoverable 
in general  the analyses are based on expected costs  utilization and dayrates for the estimated remaining useful lives of the asset or group of assets being assessed 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of the assessed asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets and could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates and methods of computing taxable income vary substantially in each jurisdiction 
our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates 
the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our levels of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year 
while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined 
current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year  withholding taxes  changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed  or from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reflected on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are determined to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to determine the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as of the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and certain assumptions regarding future taxable income  including where the rigs are expected to be deployed  as well as other assumptions related to our future tax position 
a change in such estimates and assumptions  along with any changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets  liabilities  or valuation allowances as discussed below 
as of december   we have foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards  with respect to all of which we have recognized a valuation allowance 
certain foreign nol carryforwards do not expire while others could expire starting in through we have not provided for us deferred taxes and related foreign dividend withholding taxes on approximately  million of unremitted earnings of our foreign controlled subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
if a distribution is made to us from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of additional taxes that may be assessed upon distribution of unremitted earnings 
as required by law  we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various tax authorities within the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are currently contesting several tax assessments and may contest future assessments where we believe the assessments are in error 
we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of existing or future tax assessments  however  we believe the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax assessments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe that it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous underlying factors that cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among other things  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have been appropriate  however  past experience is only a guide and the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to litigation  personal injury claims  indemnities and potential income and other tax assessments see also income taxes above 
revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter and include our costs to defend 
in situations where we expect insurance proceeds to offset contingent liabilities  we record a receivable for all probable recoveries up until the net loss is zero 
we recognize contingent gains when the contingency is resolved and the gain has been realized 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated contingencies  revisions to the estimated contingency amounts would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known

utilization is calculated as the total days worked divided by the total days in the period 
deepwater compared with revenues for our deepwater segment decreased million  or  for over the decrease in revenues is primarily due to decreased utilization of the pride north america  which experienced approximately out of service days as a result of a scheduled five year regulatory inspection and client requested upgrades in also  the pride south pacific  which was mobilized to cape town for a regulatory inspection  experienced out of service days during in addition  the pride rio de janeiro worked at a higher dayrate in than in this decrease in revenues was partially offset by increased dayrates for the pride angola  pride brazil and pride carlos walter  which collectively contributed approximately million in incremental revenues in than in as a result of the higher dayrates described above  average daily revenues increased for over earnings from operations for the segment decreased million  or  for over primarily due to the decline in revenues and an increase in repair and maintenance costs  primarily for the pride north america  pride africa and pride portland 
the decrease was also due to an increase in total labor costs for offshore rig crews  primarily for the pride angola and pride africa 
utilization decreased to for as compared to for due to higher out of service time related to shipyard projects during compared with revenues for our deepwater segment increased million  or  for over as our deepwater units earned higher dayrates  reflecting the strong worldwide demand for deepwater rigs 
the increase in revenues is primarily due to four of our rigs commencing new contracts at higher dayrates  which contributed approximately million of incremental revenues in over the strong performance was also due to the increased utilization of the pride rio de janeiro  which had a increase in days worked in over average daily revenues increased for over primarily due to higher dayrates 
earnings from operations increased million  or  for over due to the increase in revenues and a decrease in depreciation expense from the change in estimate of useful lives effective july the increase in earnings from operations was partially offset by a increase in overall labor costs for our rig crews  and an increase in repair and maintenance costs 
utilization increased to for as compared to for midwater compared with revenues for our midwater segment decreased million  or  for over the decrease in revenues is primarily due to lower utilization of the pride venezuela  which experienced approximately out of service days in following the agreement with the customer to terminate its current contract and the subsequent mobilization of the rig to the shipyard for repairs 
this decrease is also due to the pride south seas  which completed its contract in august and was idle the remainder of the year 
this decrease in revenues was largely offset by higher utilization in of the pride mexico  which started operations in july after the completion of its shipyard project 
in addition  there was lower mechanical downtime on the pride south atlantic and higher revenues for the sea explorer  which commenced a new contract in november at a substantially higher dayrate 
earnings from operations decreased million  or  for over due to increased costs related to higher activity for the pride mexico  higher rental and transportation costs on the pride venezuela  higher depreciation expense from the pride mexico and pride south seas as a result of their shipyard projects  and a decline in revenues

earnings from operations increased million  or  for over due to increased revenues offset partially by lost revenue days from planned shipyard projects coupled with repair and maintenance expenses for the pride venezuela and unscheduled maintenance for the pride south atlantic in utilization decreased to for from for the decline in utilization is primarily attributable to unscheduled maintenance and downtime in independent leg jackups compared with revenues for our independent leg jackup segment decreased million  or  for over the decrease in revenues is primarily due to the decreased dayrate and lower utilization of the pride tennessee  which was stacked in the third quarter of  and lower utilization for the pride wisconsin  which was stacked in september in addition  the pride pennsylvania was stacked in the fourth quarter of the decrease in revenues was partially offset by a full quarter of higher dayrate on the pride montana and higher utilization of the pride cabinda following completion of a day shipyard project in together  these five rigs contributed to a reduction of million in revenue for over average daily revenues increased for over due to higher utilization and dayrates for the pride cabinda and the pride montana 
earnings from operations decreased million  or  for over due to increased costs for our rig crews offset partially by increased revenues 
utilization decreased to for from for  primarily due to decreased utilization of the pride tennessee and the pride wisconsin  which was cold stacked during the third quarter of  partially offset by reduced shipyard time for the pride cabinda and pride north dakota 
compared with revenues for our independent leg jackup segment increased million  or  for over primarily due to the increased utilization for the pride hawaii  pride tennessee and pride wisconsin coupled with the incremental revenue from the pride montana  which commenced a new contract in june at a dayrate that was substantially higher than its previously contracted rate 
average daily revenues increased for over primarily due to higher dayrates for the pride cabinda and the pride montana 
earnings from operations in increased million  or  over as a result of increased revenues  partially offset by the loss of revenues from higher downtime for the pride pennsylvania and the pride north dakota

management contracts in include one management contract that ended in the third quarter of and two contracts that expire in and with early termination permitted in certain cases 
management contracts in included two contracts that ended in the third and fourth quarters of revenues from our other operations decreased million  or  for over primarily due to the termination of two management contracts in the second half of and a reduction in reimbursable revenue period over period in connection with a labor contract 
earnings from operations decreased million  or  for over primarily due to the decrease in reimbursable revenues

income taxes 
our consolidated effective income tax rate for continuing operations for was compared with for the lower tax rate for was principally the result of increased income in lower taxed jurisdictions partially offset by the recognition of benefits derived from previously unrecognized tax credits in liquidity and capital resources our objective in financing our business is to maintain both adequate financial resources and access to additional liquidity 
our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides back up liquidity to meet our on going working capital needs 
at december   we had million of availability under this facility 
during  we used cash on hand and cash flows generated from operations as our primary source of liquidity for funding our working capital needs  debt repayment and capital expenditures 
in addition  on june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we are using the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes 
we believe that our cash on hand  including the net proceeds from the notes offering  cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity through to fund our working capital needs  scheduled debt repayments and anticipated capital expenditures  including progress payments for our four drillship construction projects 
in addition  we will continue to pursue opportunities to expand or upgrade our fleet  which could result in additional capital investment 
we may also in the future elect to return capital to our stockholders by share repurchases or the payment of dividends 
we may review from time to time possible expansion and acquisition opportunities relating to our business  which may include the construction or acquisition of rigs or acquisitions of other businesses in addition to those described in this annual report 
any determination to construct or acquire additional rigs for our fleet will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time  including the availability of long term contracts with attractive dayrates and the relative costs of building or acquiring new rigs with advanced capabilities compared with the costs of retrofitting or converting existing rigs to provide similar capabilities 
the timing  size or success of any additional acquisition or construction effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances 
debt or equity financing may not  however  be available to us at that time due to a variety of events  including  among others  credit rating agency downgrades of our debt  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry 
in addition  we also review from time to time the possible disposition of assets that we do not consider core to our strategic long term business plan 
on august  we completed the spin off of seahawk to our stockholders through a pro rata stock distribution 
in connection with the spin off  we made a cash contribution to seahawk of approximately million to achieve a targeted working capital for seahawk as of may  of million 
we and seahawk also agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities that may arise or be incurred in the future attributable to our respective businesses 
in addition  pursuant to a tax support agreement between us and seahawk  we have agreed to guarantee or indemnify the issuer of any surety bonds or other collateral issued for seahawk s account in respect of certain mexican tax assessments made prior to the spin off date 
for additional information about the spin off  please read recent developments spin off of mat supported jackup business and loss of pride wyoming above and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
we anticipate making cash payments in of approximately million in connection with a possible resolution with the doj and the sec of potential liability under the fcpa 
there can be no assurance that our discussions with the doj and sec will result in a final settlement of any or all of these issues or  if a settlement is reached  the timing of any such settlement or that the terms of any such settlement would not have a material adverse effect on us 
for additional information regarding the related accrual in and our fcpa investigation  please read fcpa investigation 
sources and uses of cash compared with cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows from operations were million for compared with million for the decrease of million in cash flows from operations was primarily due to the reduction in cash flow from our discontinued operations 
the decline was also due to decreased income from continuing operations  which was primarily the result of lower fleet utilization and higher operating costs  offset partially by a decrease in our trade receivables 
cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were  million for compared with million for  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to cash proceeds of million received on the sale of assets in compared with million in  and a reduction in cash of million resulting from the spin off of seahawk in purchases of property and equipment totaled million and million for and  respectively 
we spent approximately million and million in and  respectively  on progress payments  equipment purchases and other capitalized costs in connection with our four deepwater drillship construction projects 
proceeds from dispositions of property and equipment were million for compared with million for included in the proceeds for was million related to the sale of our platform rig fleet 
cash flows provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were million for compared with cash flows used in financing activities of million for the comparable period in  an increase of million 
the period included net proceeds of million from the june notes offering  offset partially by million of scheduled debt repayments 
in  our net cash used for debt repayments included million to retire all of the outstanding convertible senior notes due  million to repay in full the outstanding amounts under our drillship loan facility and million in scheduled debt repayments 
we also received proceeds of million and of million from employee stock transactions for and  respectively 
sources and uses of cash compared with cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows from operations were million for compared with million for the increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to the increase in our income from continuing operations in due primarily to higher dayrates across the fleet and increased cash flow from our operating accounts 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in income from discontinued operations 
cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million for compared with cash flows received from investing activities of million for the decrease in cash flows received from investing activities relates primarily to net decrease in cash provided by asset sales in as compared to in  we received million in connection with the sale of our three tender assist rigs and our remaining eastern hemisphere land rigs 
in  we received cash proceeds of million from the sale of our latin america land and e p services segments  net of cash disposed of and cash selling costs 
the final net proceeds will differ as a result of settlement of the final working capital adjustment  post closing indemnities  and payment of transaction costs 
in addition  we used approximately million more cash than for capital spending in connection with our four drillships currently under construction 
purchases of property and equipment totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to progress payments  equipment purchases and other capitalized costs aggregating million in connection with the construction of our four deepwater drillship construction projects and the upgrade project for the pride mexico

we also received net proceeds of million and million from employee stock transactions in and  respectively 
working capital as of december   we had working capital of million compared with million as of december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to expenditures incurred towards the construction of our four ultra deepwater drillships and a reduction in cash due to the spin off of seahawk  offset partially by cash received from the june notes offering and various asset sales in credit ratings our senior notes due and our senior notes due are rated bbb by standard poor s rating services with a stable outlook  ba by moody s investor service  inc with a positive outlook and bb by fitch ratings with a stable outlook

in connection with the closing under our new credit facility  we terminated our then existing million senior secured credit facility 
we incurred no termination penalties and recognized a charge of million in related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the termination 
other outstanding debt as of december   in addition to our credit facility  we had the following long term debt  including current maturities  outstanding million principal amount of senior notes due  million principal amount of senior notes due  and million principal amount of notes guaranteed by the united states maritime administration 
our senior notes and our senior notes contain provisions that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries  with certain exceptions  to engage in sale and leaseback transactions  create liens and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
we are required to offer to repurchase the senior notes in connection with specified change in control events that result in a ratings decline 
if we are required to make such an offer to repurchase our senior notes  we will be required to make a concurrent offer to purchase the senior notes 
our notes guaranteed by the united states maritime administration were used to finance a portion of the cost of construction of the pride portland and pride rio de janeiro 
the notes bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of with semi annual principal payments until maturity in and are prepayable  in whole or in part  at any time  subject to a make whole premium 
the notes are collateralized by the two rigs and the net proceeds received by subsidiary project companies chartering the rigs 
in april  we called for redemption all of the outstanding convertible senior notes due in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes 
the redemption price was of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest to the redemption date 
holders of the notes could elect to convert the notes into our common stock at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  at any time prior to the redemption date 
holders of the notes elected to convert a total of million aggregate principal amount of the notes  and the remaining  aggregate principal amount was redeemed by us on the redemption date 
we delivered an aggregate of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of common stock in connection with the retirement of the notes 
although we do not expect that our level of total indebtedness will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity in future periods  it may limit our flexibility in certain areas 
please read risk factors our significant debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities in item a of this annual report 
other sources and uses of cash we expect our purchases of property and equipment for  excluding our new drillship commitments  to be approximately million for refurbishment and upgrade of our rigs and million for critical spares and other ancillary projects 
these purchases are expected to be used primarily for various rig upgrades in connection with new contracts as contracts expire during the year along with other sustaining capital projects 
with respect to our four deepwater drillships currently under construction  the total remaining costs are estimated to be approximately billion  of which approximately billion is committed at december  we anticipate making additional payments for the construction of these drillships of approximately million in and approximately million in we expect to fund construction of these rigs through available cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate making income tax payments of approximately million to million in mobilization fees received from customers and the costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one geographic area to another  as well as up front fees to modify a rig to meet a customer s specifications  are deferred and amortized over the term of the related drilling contracts 
these up front fees and costs impact liquidity in the period in which the fees are received or the costs incurred  whereas they will impact our statement of operations in the periods during which the deferred revenues and costs are amortized 
the amount of up front fees received and the related costs vary from period to period depending upon the nature of new contracts entered into and market conditions then prevailing 
generally  contracts for drilling services in remote locations or contracts that require specialized equipment will provide for higher up front fees than contracts for readily available equipment in major markets 
we may redeploy additional assets to more active regions if we have the opportunity to do so on attractive terms 
we frequently bid for or negotiate with customers regarding multi year contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
we expect to fund project opportunities primarily through a combination of working capital  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition to the matters described in this liquidity and capital resources section  please read our business and segment review for additional matters that may have a material impact on our liquidity 
letters of credit we are contingently liable as of december  in the aggregate amount of million under certain performance  bid and custom bonds and letters of credit 
as of december   we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our contractual obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration and other factors 
the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective 
less than after total year years years years in millions recorded contractual obligations principal payments on long term debt trade payables other long term liabilities unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations drillship construction agreements total amounts represent the expected cash payments for our total long term debt and do not reflect any unamortized discount 
amounts represent other liabilities related to severance and termination benefits 
amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long term debt based on the interest rates in place and amounts outstanding at december  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases 
our future operating lease payments would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
includes approximately million in purchase obligations related to drillship construction projects 
includes shipyard payments under drillship construction agreements for our four drillship construction projects 
as of december   we have approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including penalties and interest 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities

guidance issued by the fasb in and provides that all business combinations are required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but changes the method of applying the acquisition method from previous principles in a number of ways 
acquisition costs are no longer considered part of the fair value of an acquisition and will generally be expensed as incurred  non controlling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development is recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
contingent assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period

in april  the fasb provided additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
this additional guidance re emphasizes that regardless of market conditions the fair value measurement is an exit price concept as defined in asc topic and clarifies and includes additional factors to consider in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset or liability 
this guidance also provides additional clarification on estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset or liability has declined significantly 
the scope of this guidance does not include assets and liabilities measured under quoted prices in active markets 
this guidance is applied prospectively to all fair value measurements where appropriate and will be effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  we adopted the provisions of this guidance effective april   with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk  but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt as of december  and was  million and million  respectively  which was more than its carrying value of  million as of december  and less than its carrying value of million as of december  a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would increase the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we utilize the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we also utilize derivative instruments to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
at december  and  we had contracts outstanding to exchange an aggregate million and million  respectively  us dollars to hedge against the change in value of forecasted payroll transactions and related costs denominated in euros 
if we were to incur a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the net unrealized loss associated with our foreign currency denominated exchange contracts as of december  would be approximately million 
we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
