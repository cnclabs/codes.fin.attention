item business overview included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents our strategy our goal is to advance our position as a leading helicopter services provider to the offshore energy industry 
we intend to employ the following strategies to achieve this goal grow our business 
we plan to continue to grow our business globally and increase our revenue and profitability  subject to managing through cyclical downturns in the energy industry 
we have a footprint in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world  and we expect to have the opportunity to expand and deepen our presence in many of these markets 
we anticipate this growth will result primarily from the deployment of new aircraft into markets where we expect they will be most profitably employed  as well as by executing opportunistic acquisitions and investments 
through our relationships with our existing customers  we are aware of future business opportunities in the markets we currently serve that would allow us to grow through fleet addit ions 
our acquisition related growth may include increasing our role and participation with existing unconsolidated affiliates or investing in new companies  and may include increasing our position in existing markets or expanding into new markets 
be the preferred provider of helicopter services 
we position our business as the preferred provider of helicopter services by maintaining strong relationships with our customers and providing safe and high quality service 
we focus on maintaining relationships with our customers field operations and corporate management 
we believe that this focus helps us better anticipate customer needs and provide our customers with the right aircraft in the right place at the right time  which in turn allows us to better manage our existing fleet and capital investment program 
we also leverage our close relationships with our customers to establish mutually beneficial operating practices and safety standards worldwide 
by applying standard opera ting and safety practices across our global operations  we seek to provide our customers with consistent  high quality service in each of their areas of operation 
by better understanding our customers needs and by virtue of our global operations and safety standards  we have effectively competed against other helicopter service providers based on aircraft availability  customer service  safety and reliability  and not just price 
integrate our global operations 
we are an integrated global operator  and we intend to continue to identify and implement further opportunities to integrate our global organization 
we have integrated our operations among previously independently managed businesses  created a global flight and maintenance standards group  improved our global asset allocation and made other changes in our corporate and field operations 
market outlook our core business is providing helicopter services to the worldwide oil and gas industry 
our customers operating expenditures in the production sector are the principal source of our revenue  while their exploration and development capital expenditures provide a lesser portion of our revenue 
our customers typically base their capital expenditure budgets on their long term commodity price expectations and not exclusively on the current spot price 
in  the credit  equity and commodity markets were volatile causing many of our oil and gas company customers to reduce capital spending plans and defer projects 
thus far in  oil prices have stabilized around per barrel 
we believe that the continued stability of oil prices may lead to confidence among our customers and increased capital expenditure budgets  and we are already seeing some larger projects moving ahead that were previously on hold 
while we are cautiously optimistic that the economic conditions will continue to recover  we continue to seek ways to reduce costs and work with our customers to improve the efficiency of their operations 
our global operations and critical mass of helicopters provide us with diversity of geographic and customer focus to help mitigate risks associated with a single market or customer and allows us to respond to increased demand in certain markets through redeployment of assets 
although some of the global demand for our services has softened  the fundamental long term challenge for our industry is the limited availability of new aircraft and the need throughout the industry to retire many of the older aircraft in the worldwide fleet 
currently manufacturers have some available aircraft  however  there are some constraints on supply of new large aircraft 
the aftermarket for sales of our older aircraft has also softened and sale prices have declined  reflecting fewer buyers with available capital 
we continue to expect to grow our business through the delivery of aircraft on order and potentially through acquisitions and investments  subject to managing through cyclical downturns in the energy industry 
additionally  during fiscal year  we invested in brazil  an emerging market and potential growth area  through our acquisition of a interest in l der

table of contents on thursday  april   a deepwater us gulf of mexico drilling rig  deepwater horizon  that was engaged in drilling operations  sank after an apparent blowout and fire 
although attempts are being made to seal the well  hydrocarbons have been leaking and the spill area continues to grow 
if conditions continue to deteriorate  the oil and gas companies we serve in the u 
s 
gulf of mexico may be forced to suspend operations  and our customers may elect to reduce the number of aircraft on contract 
at this time  we cannot predict the full impact of the incident and resulting spill on oil and gas exploration or production operations in the us gulf of mexico 
in addition  we cannot predict how government agencies will respond to the incident or wh ether changes in laws and regulations concerning operations in the us gulf of mexico  including the ability to obtain drilling permits  will result in reduced activity in this market 
we expect that our cash on deposit as of march  of million  cash flow from operations and proceeds from aircraft sales  as well as the million borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our capital commitments  including our remaining aircraft purchase commitments of million as of march  we plan to continue to be disciplined in our capital commitment program 
therefore  we do not foresee an immediate need to raise capital through new financings 
however  we are currently experiencing an active bid market for new helicopter contract work for customers and our view on capital needs may change based on the success of bids in the marketplace 
we conduct business in various foreign countries  and as such  our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations and related risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
throughout fiscal year  our primary foreign currency exposure has related to the euro  the british pound sterling and the australian dollar 
the value of each of these currencies has strengthened relative to the us dollar causing an increase in our operating income during the fiscal year for additional details  see item a

operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by gross revenue 

table of contents earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a measure that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies gaap and has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors 
ebitda is therefore considered a non gaap financial measure 
management believes ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because it excludes amounts that management does not consider part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization 
a description of adjustments and a reconciliation to net income from continuing operations  the most comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda is as follows fiscal year ended march  in thousands net income from continuing operations provision for income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda excludes flight hours from bristow academy and unconsolidated affiliates 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in gross revenue is primarily due to our october  acquisition of the interest in bristow norway that we did not previously own and increased rates charged to customers 
the acquisition of bristow norway increased revenue by million from fiscal year to fiscal year these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue in north america resulting from the gom asset sale and lower demand for services in that market  a decrease in fuel costs rebilled to our customers and the unfavorable impact of million from changes in exchange rates  primarily on revenue for our europe business unit 
excluding the impact of the special items listed below  operating income  operating margin and ebitda would have been million  and million  respectively  in fiscal year and million  and million  respectively  in fiscal year  representing an improvement for each of these items 
this improvement was primarily driven by results in west africa and australia and an increase in gain on disposal of other assets of million  partially offset by lower operating results in certain other business units  primarily north america and other international  as well as increased general and administrative expenses 
excluding the impact of the special items listed below  net income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations would have been million and  respectively  for fiscal year and million and  respectively  for fiscal year in addition to the items affecting operating income discussed above  the improvement over fiscal year resulted from a million decrease in our provision for income taxes  partially offset by a million increase in interest expense  net

fiscal year compared to fiscal year set forth below is a discussion of operations of our business units 
our consolidated results are discussed under results of operations above 
north america fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours the decrease in flight hours  gross revenue and operating expense is primarily due to the gom asset sale as well as an overall decline in the demand for aircraft in this market resulting from decreased drilling activity 
the gom asset sale resulted in a decrease in revenue and flight hours of million and  respectively 
additionally  both revenue and operating expense decreased as a result of a decrease in fuel costs  which are generally recovered from our customers  due to a combination of a decrease in fuel price and lower flight hours 
operating margin has deteriorated due to the decline in demand in this market discussed above 
we added four new large s aircraft to the us gulf of mexico market during fiscal year  which will allow us to meet the requirements of offshore customers operating in deeper water 
we have also introduced the aw medium helicopter to our fleet and took delivery of additional medium s c s 
although we expect the us gulf of mexico to be a challenging market in fiscal year  larger equipment that is capable of carrying more passengers longer distances is expected to generate higher revenues and profit margins 
as discussed under executive overview market outlook above  the recent incident where a drilling rig in the us gulf of mexico sank and the resulting oil spill could have an impact on our operations in this market and on the ability of our customers to operate in deep water 
europe fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net operating margin flight hours 
table of contents gross revenue and flight hours for europe increased primarily as a result of a full year of results from bristow norway which we began consolidating effective october   which resulted in an increase of million and  hours  respectively  ad hoc flying in the north sea  and an increase in out of pocket costs rebilled to our customers reimbursable revenue 
the impact of these improvements was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates and a lower level of contractual escalation billings in fiscal year operating expense for europe increased primarily due to the consolidation of bristow norway million 
the increase in operating expense was partially offset by reduced operating expense resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates 
additionally  operating expense decreased in fiscal year as a result of correcting prior period errors million relating to depreciation expense 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates includes earnings from our equity investment in fbs limited  fb heliservices limited and fb leasing limited  which did not change significantly from fiscal year to fiscal year operating margin decreased due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates as well as the inclusion of bristow norway for a full year as bristow norway has a lower opera ting margin than the rest of the europe business unit 
west africa fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours flight hours for west africa decreased as a result of a decrease in demand for aircraft in this market by certain existing customers  partially offset by the addition of new contracts and ad hoc work 
despite the decrease in flight hours  gross revenue increased due to rate escalations under existing contracts and higher rates earned on new contracts and on ad hoc flying 
the increase in operating expense was primarily a result of increases in salaries and benefits  maintenance and insurance expense 
also  during fiscal year we recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of obsolete inventory 
the increase in operating expense was partially offset by a favorable impact from changes in exchange rates 
excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates  the operating margin for west africa was in fiscal year  which was slightly improved over fiscal year due to rate escalations under existing contracts and higher rates earned on new contracts and ad hoc work 
we experience periodic disruption to our operations in nigeria related to civil unrest and violence 
during august  the unions representing our national staff in nigeria were on strike  but have since returned to work while discussions are ongoing 
these factors have made and are expected to continue to make our operating results from nigeria unpredictable 
australia fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours flight hours for australia decreased due to a decrease in activity in this market since fiscal year despite the decrease in flight hours  gross revenue increased due to a shift to larger aircraft on contract  some of which are new aircraft earning higher rates  a favorable impact from changes in exchange rates and an increase in reimbursable revenue 

table of contents operating expense decreased primarily due to decreased activity and cost reduction initiatives including decreases in maintenance  fuel and travel expenses 
operating expense was also decreased as a result of the reversal of costs previously accrued in fiscal year for tax items as favorable rulings were obtained from the tax authorities on these matters during fiscal year during fiscal year  we incurred salary  maintenance and other costs on aircraft that were not fully operational as a result of delays in planned contracts  unscheduled maintenance and re positioning of aircraft 
operating margin improved due to both an increase in aircraft on contract  some of which are new aircraft earning higher rates  and the decrease in costs discussed above 
other international fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net operating margin flight hours flight hours and gross revenue decreased primarily due to our exit from mauritania  kazakhstan  peru and colombia and decreased activity in trinidad  partially offset by an increase in activity in libya due to a new contract  mexico due to an increase in rates and activity and brazil due to aircraft maintenance support provided on aircraft in brazil 
operating expense increased due an increase to the bad debt allowance of million in mexico and the inclusion in fiscal year of million in escalation charges to a customer in russia  partially offset by increases in brazil due to million of earnings generated from our investment in l der in fiscal year  kazakhstan due to a reversal of million of bad debt expense and libya due to a new contract 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses  decreased as fiscal year included earnings of million from our investment in l der on may  while fiscal year included million in equity earnings due to collection of past due receivables by rlr see discussion in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in th is annual report 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in mexico and egypt were not substantially changed from fiscal year to fiscal year equity in earnings from our investment in l der included million attributable to foreign currency transaction gains 
in january  we acquired an additional interest in rotorwing leasing resources  llc rlr for million and as a result own of rlr 
we have the option to purchase the remaining of rlr on january   or earlier if the current interest holder ceases to be a guarantor of of rlr s outstanding debt to a lender 
additionally  in january and february  we and our partner contributed million and million  respectively  to heliservicio  in which we have a equity method investment 
this recent contribution did not change our ownership percentage in heliservicio 
rlr has leased all of its aircraft to heliservicio 
as of march   heliservicio owed rlr and other of our subsidiaries million  we have provided an allowance for doubtfu l accounts of million 
as a result of the expiration of our partner s aircraft operating certificate in kazakhstan in mid october  we have removed our two aircraft from this market 
neither we nor our partner in kazakhstan are operating in this market  which resulted in a reduction in revenue 
during fiscal year  we had revenue from our operations in kazakhstan totaling million and operating income totaling million including million of reversal of bad debt allowance versus million of revenue and million of operating income in fiscal year 
table of contents corporate and other fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages gross revenue operating expense losses from unconsolidated affiliates operating loss corporate and other includes our bristow academy business unit  technical services business and corporate costs that have not been allocated out to other business units 
gross revenue increased due to increased revenue at bristow academy as a result of increased military training and the acquisition of additional training aircraft  partially offset by a decrease in technical services revenue due to timing of part sales 
operating expense increased due to increases in corporate and bristow academy 
corporate operating expense primarily represents costs of our corporate office and other general and administrative costs not allocated to our business units 
corporate operating expense increased from fiscal year due to million of compensation costs from the departure of three officers during fiscal year and higher expense recorded for incentive compensation during fiscal year operating expense increased at bristow academy primarily due to increased business volume as well as costs of operating additional aircraft 
the operating margin improved for bristow academy from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due to the fact that the military training contracts yield a higher margin of return

proposals have recently been put forth in the us which  if enacted into law  would significantly change the us taxation of us based multinational businesses such as ours 
these proposals include  but are not limited to  amending the foreign tax credit rules which would have the likely effect of reducing the foreign tax credit available to offset us income tax and increase the double taxation of our us earnings and deferring the deductibility of expenses to the extent the deductions are deemed related to the production of certain non us income 
additionally  a number of tax provisions have expired for our fiscal years ending after march  while there are several legislative proposals to extend multiple expiring provisions  there is no certainty regarding which provisions will be exten ded  the effective date of the extension or the changes that may be made to extension provisions prior to their being enacted into law 
enactment of new provisions or the failure to extend the expired provisions could have a material impact on the amount of our earnings subject to tax in the us as well as the timing for subjecting such earnings to us tax 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further information on the tax treatment of our foreign earnings 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in noncontrolling interest expense is primarily due to decreases in income from rlr of million and our russian subsidiary of million during fiscal year see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year set forth below is a discussion of the results of operations of our business units 
our consolidated results are discussed under executive overview overview of operating results above 
north america fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours gross revenue for north america increased primarily due to an increase in billings to our customers for fuel costs  a favorable shift in the mix of aircraft type utilized towards more medium and large aircraft in fiscal year partially driven by the sale of small aircraft in the gom asset sale on october  as medium and large aircraft earn higher rates than small aircraft and new contract work in alaska 
this increase was partially offset by the negative impact of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico during fiscal year as well as a decrease in flight hours resulting from the sale of the aircraft included in the gom asset sale 
in connection with the gom asset sale  we entered into a transition services agreement tsa with the buyer under which we agreed to operate the aircraft incl uded in the gom asset sale until operational control was transferred to the buyer s faa operating certificate 
we generated million in revenue from the tsa during fiscal year  which also partially offset the loss of revenue from the sale of the aircraft 
operating expense for north america increased due to the fact that some of our bases were damaged by hurricanes in fiscal year and we incurred higher than normal operating costs  such as unreimbursed property expenses and evacuation and redeployment expenses

discontinued operations discontinued operations for fiscal year incurred a million after tax loss compared to a million after tax loss in fiscal year we previously provided production management services  contract personnel and medical support services in the us gulf of mexico to the domestic oil and gas industry under the grasso production management grasso name 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  on november   we sold grasso  and therefore the financial results for our production management services segment are classified as discontinued operations 
the million after tax loss during fiscal year resulted from purchase price adjustments from the sale of grasso 
the lo ss for fiscal year is due to taxes associated with non deductible goodwill of million recorded in the provision for income taxes on discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income  as well as million in transaction expenses partially offset by the million gain on sale and million of pre sale operating income 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash from operations to fund our investing and financing activities 
while our principal source of liquidity for the past three years has been financing cash flows which we have used to fund our fleet investment program and other investments  we have also generated significant operating cash flows 
we maintain a conservative capital structure to provide financial flexibility 
accordingly  since the beginning of fiscal year we have raised billion of capital in a mix of debt and equity with both public and private financings 
during this same period we have spent billion on capital expenditures to grow our business 
in addition  other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditure commitments  pension funding  operating leases  adequacy of available bank lines of credit and ability to attract long term capital at satisfactory terms 
recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on financial market activities including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades and declining valuations 
one of our unconsolidated affiliates has been unable to secure financing and we have seen a decline in the demand for helicopter services  primarily in the exploration and development sector  with more limited declines in the production sector 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and are continuing to closely monitor the impact on our customers and suppliers 
we issued million of convertible senior notes and  shares of common stock in a public offering and private placement in june we expect that our cash on deposit as of march  of million  cash flow from operations and proceeds from aircraft sales  as well as the million borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our remaining aircraft purchase commitments of million as of march  we plan to continue to be disciplined in our capital commitment program 
therefore  we do not foresee an immediate need to raise additional capital through new financings 
however  we are currently experiencing an active bid market for new helicopter contract work for customers  and our view on capital needs may change based on the success of bids in the marketplace 
due to the significant investment in aircraft made in fiscal years  and  net capital expenditures exceeded cash flow from operations  and this could continue in fiscal year in addition to payments for aircraft commitments of million  we expect to invest approximately million in various infrastructure enhancements  including aircraft facilities  training centers and technology in fiscal year see a discussion of our cash flows during fiscal years  and below

pension obligations as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability related to the bristow helicopters group limited a wholly owned subsidiary of bristow aviation  bristow international aviation guernsey limited and bristow norway pension plans 
the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
the minimum funding rules of the uk require us to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as defined by uk legislation within three years and funded within years 
in order to meet our funding requirements  we increased the contributions to the plans to million million per year beginning in f iscal year and continuing in fiscal year we pre funded the fiscal year employer contributions for the uk pension plans in march for million million  and also pre funded the fiscal year employer contributions during march for million million 
nevertheless  regulatory agencies in the uk may require us to further increase the contributions 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  professional advice and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note in t he notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure 
taxes our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws rela ting to the offshore oilfield service industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 

table of contents we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market conditions in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizab le foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation  including reserves for income  value added  sales and payroll taxes 
the expenses reported for these taxes  including our annual tax provision  include the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude that a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly 
during fiscal years and  we had net accruals of reserves for estimated tax exposures of million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  we had net reversals of reserves for estimated income tax exposures of million 
these reversals were made in the periods in which the statute of limitations for the related exposures expired 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate  if recognized 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential effect of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
ho wever  past experience is only a guide and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amounts accrued 
judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carry forwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are estimated to not be realizable 
as of march   our valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  primarily us foreign tax credit carry forwards  was million 
we did not materially increase or decrease the valuation allowance during the fiscal year as it remains at million as of march  if our facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the li kelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance in any given period 
such changes could result in either a decrease or an increase in our provision for income taxes  depending on whether the change in judgment resulted in an increase or a decrease to the valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of march  that are indefinitely reinvested abroad of million 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
at the current time  a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practical 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in such jurisdictions will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents property and equipment our net property and equipment represents percent of our total assets as of march  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
our property and equipment accounting policies are also designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of our assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 
useful lives of aircraft and residual values are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including changes in operating conditions or environment  the introduction of technological advances in aviation equipment  changes in market or economic conditions including changes in demand for certain types of aircraft and changes in laws or regulations affecting the aviation or offshore oil and gas industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipate d performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
supply and demand are the key drivers of aircraft idle time and our ability to contract our aircraft at economical rates 
during periods of oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have aircraft idled for extended periods of time  which could be an indication that an asset group may be impaired 
in most instances our aircraft could be used interchangeably 
in addition  our aircraft are generally equipped to operate throughout the world 
because our aircraft are mobile  we may move aircraft from a weak geographic market to a stronger geographic market if an adequate opportunity arises to do so 
as such  our aircraft are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  our impairment evaluation is made by asset group 
additionally  our mana gement periodically makes strategic decisions related to our fleet that involve the possible removal of all or a substantial portion of specific aircraft types from our fleet  at which time these aircraft are reclassified to held for sale and subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenue and cost related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
pension benefits pension obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates  compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 

table of contents three of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the assumed discount rate and the mortality rate 
we evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plan s portfolios 
we utilize a british pound sterling denominated aa corporate bond index as a basis for determining the discount rate for our uk plans 
we base mortality rates utilized on actuarial research on these rates  which are adjusted to allow for expected mortality within our industry segment 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial c omputations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over the average remaining lifetime of the plan members 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the payment of amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
in establishing these allowances  we consider a number of factors  including our historical experience  changes in our customer s financial position and restrictions placed on the conversion of local currency to us dollars  as well as disputes with customers regarding the application of contract provisions to our services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services to major integrated oil and gas companies and government owned or government controlled oil and gas companies 
our receivables are concentrated in certain oil producing countries 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was restricted  resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory allowance we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine whether the realizable value of this inventory is lower than its book value 
parts related to aircraft types that our management has determined will no longer be included in our fleet or will be substantially reduced in our fleet in future periods are specifically reviewed 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly lower than the book value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to potential tax assessments  litigation  personal injury claims and environmental liabilities 
income for each reporting period includes revisions to contingent liability reserves resulting from different facts or information which becomes known or circumstances which change and affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
such revisions are based on information which becomes known or circumstances that change after the reporting date for the previous period through the reporting date of the current period 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required to be recognized 
goodwill impairment we perform a test for impairment of our goodwill annually as of march and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
because our business is cyclical in nature  goodwill could be significantly impaired depending on when the assessment is performed in the business cycle 
the fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows  publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples 
the assessments are based in part on assumptions regarding the demand for helicopter services  the necessity for training of new pilots bristow academy only and current market values for similar business and involve the use of a discounted cash flow model utilizing estimated future earnings and cash flows and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace  respectively  for companies with operations similar to ours 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 

table of contents stock based compensation we have historically compensated our directors  executives and certain employees by awarding stock based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions  including the risk free interest rate  volatility  dividend yield and the expected term of the options  in order to determine the fair value of the options on the date of grant 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
additionally  the service period over which compensation expense associated with awards of restricted stock units are recorded in our consolidated statements of income involve ce rtain assumptions as to the expected vesting of the restricted stock units  which is based on factors relating to the future performance of our stock 
as the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options and the service period for restricted stock units are critical estimates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the option 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of shares of our common stock  which has not been adjusted for any expectation of future volatility given uncertainty related to the future performance of our common stock at this time 
we also use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options within the option pricing model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
foreign currency risk through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expense from our north sea operations are in british pound sterling 
approximately of our gross revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pound sterling into us dollars 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies  such as australian dollars  euros  norwegian kroner  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in certain foreign countries 
except as described below  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our gross revenue 

table of contents throughout fiscal years  and  our primary foreign currency exposure has been to the euro  the british pound sterling  the australian dollar and the nigerian naira 
the value of these currencies has fluctuated relative to the us dollar as indicated in the following table fiscal year ended march  one british pound sterling into us dollars high average low at period end one euro into us dollar high average low at period end one australian dollar into us dollars high average low at period end one nigerian naira into us dollar high average low at period end source bank of england and oanda 
com we estimate that the fluctuation of these currencies versus the prior fiscal year had the following effect on our financial condition and results of operations  net of the effect of the derivative contracts discussed below in thousands fiscal year ended march  revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses non operating expense income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income from continuing operations cumulative translation adjustment total stockholders investment 
table of contents a hypothetical strengthening or weakening in the average us dollar relative to other currencies would have affected our revenue  operating income and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year as follows euro british pound sterling nigerian naira australian dollar revenue operating expenses income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables  including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  all currencies may not uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
in addition  certain of our contractual commitments  including aircraft purchase commitments  are payable in currencies other than the us dollar  which exposes us to cash flow risk during periods when the us dollar weakens against those currencies 
we entered into forward contracts during fiscal years and to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments  which have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
we had no open forward contracts relating to euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments as of march  we had eight open forward contracts as of march   which had rates ranging from us dollars per euro to us dollars per euro 
these contracts had an underlying nomina l value of between  and  for a total of  with the first contract expiring in april and the last in january the hedge expiring in january was settled in november as of march   the fair value of these contracts was a liability of million 
as of march   an unrecognized loss of million  net of tax  on these contracts is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the derivative liability is included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
for fiscal year  we recognized gains of million relating to early settlement of these forward contracts in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other income expense  net 
no gains or losses relating to forward contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal year in the past three fiscal years  our stockholders investment has decreased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
as a result of the changes in exchange rates  we recorded foreign currency losses of million during fiscal year and foreign currency gains of approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal years and  primarily related to the british pound sterling 
see fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net and fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net included elsewhere in this annual report for discussion of transaction gains and losses 
during fiscal year  we entered into participating forward derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our euro denominated third party maintenance contracts 
as of march   the fair value of the three open contracts was a liability of million with strike call prices ranging from british pound sterling per euro to british pound sterling per euro and underlying notional values totaling  expiring in june the related strike put prices and the expiration dates are the same as the calls but have underlying notional values totaling  these contracts were designated as hedges for accounting purposes  and as such  any changes to the fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded in accumulated other c omprehensive loss if the hedge is deemed to be effective 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of the foreign currencies in which our business is denominated relative to the us dollar as of march  would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 

table of contents credit risk the market for our services and products is primarily the offshore oil and gas industry  and our customers consist primarily of major integrated  international and independent oil and gas producers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and have not historically required material collateral 
we maintain allowances for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
cash equivalents  which consist of funds invested in highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of days or less  are held by major banks or investment firms  and we believe that credit risk in these instruments is minimal 
we also manage our credit risk by not entering into complex financial transactions or those with a perceived high level of credit risk 
for more information on the impact of the global recession see executive overview market outlook and liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity included elsewhere in this annual report 
interest rate risk as of march   we have million of debt outstanding  million of which carries a variable rate of interest 
the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third party financial institutions 
the estimated fair value of our total debt as of march  and was million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices for the publicly listed senior notes  senior notes  convertible senior notes and the carrying value for all of our other debt  which approximates fair value 
if prevailing market interest rates had been higher as of march   and all other factors effecting our debt remained the same  the fair value of the senior notes  the senior notes and convertible senior notes would have decreased by million or 
under comparable sensitivity analysis as of march   the fair value of the senior notes  the senior notes and convertible senior notes would have decreased by million or
