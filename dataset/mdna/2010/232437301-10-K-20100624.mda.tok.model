our products are sold in bulk quantities to manufacturers  formulators and distributors in the health foods and nutritional supplements markets and as packaged consumer products to distributors  retailers and direct consumers 
the company manufactures its products in hawaii  but markets them worldwide  generating  and of its revenues outside of the united states for each of the years ended march   and  respectively 
competing in a global marketplace  the company is influenced by the general economic conditions of the countries in which its customers operate  including adherence to its customers local governmental regulations and requirements 
the company currently has no material foreign exchange exposure as all sales are in us currency

working capital increased to 
table of contents  at march  from working capital of  a year ago  primarily due to increased inventory balances and reclassification of  restricted cash from long term to current 
the following table details selected financial data highlighting three key areas year ended march  in thousands net sales spirulina products natural astaxanthin products other products gross profit as a percentage of sales operating expenses as a percentage of sales net sales for fiscal were  or higher than the  reported for the prior fiscal year 
sales increased in both spirulina and astaxanthin lines as production levels remained high and the company focused on human nutrition and expansion of its higher margin consumer products 
the company s emphasis is on growing the market for its high quality health and nutritional product  bioastin and spirulina pacifica  in both bulk form for use worldwide and in consumer packaged goods distributed primarily in the us the company introduced three new vitamin products during based on the nutrition value of spirulina and enhanced with other key ingredients to support the specific health requirements of men  women and seniors 
two new astaxanthin products were introduced promoting the benefits of vegetarian omegas and targeting eye health 
consumer acceptance of these products cannot be predicted 
the company will continue to emphasize the higher nutritional content of its hawaiian spirulina and the benefits of our natural astaxanthin over synthetics however  increased competition may result in the decline of margins in the future 
management cannot predict whether the outcomes of any of its strategies will be successful 
the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for the fiscal year ended march   up from for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal year gross margin increase of was primarily due a reduction of per unit costs as production levels remained high throughout the year 
pricing increases were instituted in fiscal year and remained unchanged in spirulina and astaxanthin production levels remained high for a second straight year resulting in lower per unit costs 
however  because complex biological processes are involved and these processes are influenced by factors beyond the company s control the weather  for example we cannot assure that such production levels will continue 
because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to maintain reasonably strong production volumes in order to support the basic resource levels required to sustain a large scale  open culture  natural agricultural facility 
the company continues to strive to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
results of operations revenues net sales for fiscal totaled  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal and a increase from net sales of  reported in fiscal the following is a discussion of revenues by major product category 

table of contents spirulina the company has been producing spirulina pacifica  a strain of spirulina microalgae  since revenues generated from the company s spirulina products are a significant portion of total revenues  amounting to   and  for the years ended march   and respectively 
spirulina revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the three years ended march   is  and  respectively 
approximately  or of net sales for the year ended march  were to a spirulina marketing and distribution company based in the netherlands 
sales to this customer during fiscal years and amounted to  or of net sales  and  or of net sales 
fiscal spirulina sales increased  or  a result of more units sold and increase in average selling price as compared to in fiscal  sales increased from resulting from more units sold and increase in average selling price 
competition for sales of spirulina remains intense due to the high number of suppliers 
we expect competitive pricing pressure to continue in future periods and will continue to focus on the higher quality of hawaiian spirulina in support of customers who demand higher quality raw materials for their formulations 
natural astaxanthin in fiscal  the company s sales of its natural astaxanthin products were  an increase of from  in fiscal  and an increase of from  in fiscal the increase in natural astaxanthin sales for was the result of a increase in units sold and an increase in average selling price of 
the increase in natural astaxanthin sales for was the result of a increase in units sold 
a single customer accounted for  or of net sales for the year ended march  a single customer accounted for  or of net sales for the year ended march  we believe that sales to these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of total net sales in future periods 
during  the company discontinued production of its animal product  naturose  in order to focus on the human astaxanthin products which are experiencing greater demand and have higher gross margins 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was at  and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
cost of sales includes the cost of nutrients and materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs  depreciation and amortization of production equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements associated with the production of inventory units sold  and other production related period costs 
the cost of sales as a percent of sales decrease of points between and  and points between and  is the result of improved control of customary and complex production variables related to astaxanthin and spirulina production 
customary variables include availability and costs of personnel  raw materials  energy and freight 
these variables fluctuate based on changes in the local  national and world economies 
complex variables include cultivation methods  feeding formulations and harvesting processes  all of which include efforts to anticipate the extent of weather and environmental events and make timely and sufficient adjustments 
although the variability of such costs can not be fully anticipated  the company has focused increased effort in this area in order to produce both spirulina and astaxanthin at levels sufficient to fully absorb production costs into inventory 
because the company s processes are agricultural  it is important to maintain production volumes in order to support the minimal resource levels required to sustain a large scale open culture agricultural facility 
the company had non inventoriable costs in fiscal the company expensed  of non inventoriable costs in fiscal year in fiscal   of non inventoriable costs were deemed to be period costs resulting from an abnormal usage of chemicals  labor and utilities expended to manage the spirulina production problems  re inoculation and subsequent flooding which occurred in december these expenditures combined to significantly increase cost of sales relative to units produced and correspondingly reduced gross profit for the year ended march  on march   the company announced its decision to abandon the animal nutrition market in favor of human products with higher demand and margins 

table of contents fresh water is critical for the company s natural astaxanthin production and  while the company has not experienced any constraint on fresh water availability  future availability could be negatively impacted by significant growth in the local population as well as by throughput constraints on the water delivery infrastructure owned by the county of hawaii 
given the criticality of fresh water to our operations and the community  the company recycles fresh water where possible and has developed additional water recycling systems in its efforts to utilize fresh water efficiently 
both fresh and sea water require electricity for pumping  and electricity  the company s single largest expenditure  depends on the cost of fuel oil which is  in turn  tied to the global price of crude oil 
fuel costs remained at consistent levels throughout fiscal and the company did not incur the extreme highs experienced in fiscal however  continued volatility in fuel cost in the future is likely 
therefore  the company expects that electricity  water and shipping costs could be higher due to the impact of fuel cost increases for fiscal the company utilizes two third party contractors for the process of extraction for its natural astaxanthin product for the human nutrition market  and several third party contractors are utilized for both encapsulation for gelcaps and micro encapsulation for beadlets 
although these services are available from a limited number of sources  management believes the company has the ability to use other parties if any of the current contractors become unavailable 
if pricing for any of these services significantly increases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there have not been any significant changes in the cost of extraction or encapsulation services and none are currently anticipated 
to offset increased production costs  the company seeks ways to increase production efficiencies in volume yield  potency  and quality consistent with the company s commitment to produce high value  high quality products 
however  these efforts cannot be guaranteed to achieve the desired results 
the company recognizes abnormal production costs including fixed cost variances from normal production capacity as an expense in the period incurred 
abnormal amounts of freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage are recognized as current period charges and fixed production overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
these amounts were   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on cost of sales 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  and changes in processing or production methods 
gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased points to for the fiscal year ended march   up from for fiscal the improvement is the result of increased sales volume driven by product availability and quality  price increases instituted throughout and increases in units produced resulting in lower unit costs 
the increase of percentage points in fiscal over was primarily the result of lower period costs resulting from production levels below normal capacity in as previously explained 
management expects the company s fiscal gross profit margin percentage to remain generally consistent with the results reported for fiscal however  as discussed elsewhere in this annual report  management cannot predict future production levels 
producing the highest quality microalgae is a complex biological process which requires the tenuous balancing of numerous factors including microalgal strain variations  temperature  acidity  nutrient and other environmental considerations  some of which are 
table of contents not in the company s control 
as a result  it can be difficult and time consuming to adjust  improve or correct production process when quality levels fall below specifications 
while the company generally possesses scientific knowledge and resources to correct its production processes  there are too many variables involved for the company to make reliable projections concerning such efforts 
however  management constantly strives to anticipate events requiring adjustments to nutrients  processes  customer demands  etc 
and strive to achieve increased production yields and improve quality 
in addition to the items discussed above  there are many factors which could materially diminish gross profit 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal total operating expense increased by  or over levels 
the increase includes an increase in general and administrative expenses of  an increase sales and marketing expense of  an increase in research and development expense of  and an increase in loss on disposal of equipment and leasehold improvements of  the decrease in from as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the increase in net sales 
general and administrative expenses were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased from due to costs associated with separation of the chief executive officer in march and salary and benefits increases 
general and administrative expense in increased over due to increased salaries and benefits from the addition of a new chief executive officer  an accountant to improve internal controls  and salary and benefits increases 
current staffing has returned to the pre workforce reduction levels in order to maintain adequate administration and financial accounting and reporting 
the company is committed to ongoing cost containment aimed at controlling its level of operating expenses  but may increase some discretionary spending in future periods as necessary to maintain product quality and the company s competitive position 
sales and marketing costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  increasing in from fiscal and decreasing in from fiscal the increase in over is due to the company resuming selected advertising and promotional programs in fiscal in order to maintain and expand sales levels 
the decrease in from is due to the cessation of advertising programs and selling promotions eliminated with efforts to control expenses in the latter part of fiscal the company anticipates continuing selected advertising and promotional programs in fiscal in order to maintain and expand sales levels as determined by the needs of the business 
research and development costs increased to  in  up from  in fiscal  and up by from  in fiscal during fiscal year  new clinical trials initiated to expand the application of its products 
in fiscal  resources returned their focus on identifying potential areas to improve cultivation and production processes  therefore r d expense increased from the company benefited from these efforts in fiscal and  and they will continue in the company began to sponsor clinical studies once again in fiscal year  in order to expand the applications of its health products 
no new clinical trials were conducted in and loss on disposal of equipment and leasehold improvements was  in there was no loss on disposal of assets in the company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
this analysis at march  determined that the company s equipment and leasehold improvements are not impaired in cyanotech s consolidated balance sheet at march  the company expects fiscal operating expense spending will remain consistent with or increase from fiscal due to increased personnel costs  inflationary increases of expenses and the resumption of 
table of contents selected marketing and research activities as previously discussed 
the company will continue to leverage customer supported research where and as practicable 
increases in sales and marketing expenses may become necessary as the company seeks new and increased markets and market share 
also  the cost of regulatory compliance including international standards iso  us food and drug manufacturing practice gmp  securities and exchange commission requirements including sarbanes oxley  nasdaq capital market listing requirements and other regulatory compliance areas continue to increase 
the company will be required under sarbanes oxley to have an independent audit of the company s internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal year ending march  this will be an expense not currently incurred by the company 
finally  the company must remain competitive in the labor market  and this may lead to some increases in general and administrative costs 
other expense the following details the amounts included in other expense in thousands interest expense on term loan agreement other interest expense other income expense  net total other expense the total principal balance on the company s term loans was   and  as of march   and  respectively

fiscal also includes state sales tax expense related to prior years 
fiscal also included gains losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions of the company s japan subsidiary which was discontinued in income taxes for fiscal the company recorded income tax expense of  compared with an income tax expense of  for and  for the income tax expense represents primarily alternative minimum taxes due to the utilization of tax loss carry forwards 
at march  the company had federal and hawaii state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating loss benefits have been fully reserved as their utilization is not assured 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition at march   the company s working capital was  an increase of  compared to  at march  cash and cash equivalents at march  totaled  a decrease of  from  at march  the increase in working capital is mainly due to an increase in inventories from the prior year and the reclassification of  restricted cash from long term to current 
good production levels throughout fiscal and have allowed the company to build sufficient inventory to meet the needs of our customers on a timely basis 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is due to cash used in investing in equipment and leasehold improvements and financing activities 

table of contents the company has two term loan agreements term loans with a lender 
these provided up to million in combined credit facilities which are secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
the outstanding combined balance under the term loans as of march  is approximately  the term loans have maturity dates of may  as to  and march  as to  and are payable in equal monthly principal and interest payments of approximately  one term loan with a balance of  was subsequently paid in full on may  the interest rate under the term loans  in absence of a default under the agreement  is the prime rate in effect as of the close of business on the first day of each calendar quarter  plus

the company generated cash from operating activities of  and  fiscal years and respectively  compared to cash used in operations of  in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operations from was primarily due to the fiscal net income of  non cash expenses totaling  and timing differences in current payables  offset by increased inventory and prepaid balances of  the improved cash provided by operations in fiscal year compared to 
table of contents fiscal year is primarily due to the fiscal net income of  non cash expenses totaling  and timing differences in current payables and receivables  offset by increased inventory balances of  depreciation and amortization expense was   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
depreciation expense for was more than as a result of additions to depreciable assets in fiscal it is uncertain whether operating activities will generate cash in future periods due to the volatility of the world economy and its impact on our foreign customers 
net cash of  was used in investing activities during fiscal compared to net cash used in investing activities of  during fiscal net cash used in investing activities in was  investments are primarily plant and equipment purchases aimed toward enhancing or maintaining our ability to respond to market demand 
management expects to continue to invest in equipment upgrades and leasehold improvements tied to market requirements and production efficiency 
investment was also made in phase one of the company s resource management system upgrade 
continued expenditures to expand the system are anticipated for the next fiscal year 
future capital expenditures are expected to remain level or decrease as compared to amounts expended in fiscal during fiscal  cash used in financing activities was  consisting of  cash provided from drawing on the credit line with first hawaiian bank  offset by principal payments on term debt of  during fiscal  cash used in financing activities was  representing principal payments on long term debt 
during fiscal  cash obtained from financing activities amounted to  the proceeds of senior debt 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal was  in principal payments on long term debt and  of closing costs related to the senior debt 
sufficiency of liquidity based upon our current operating plan  analysis of our consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations  we believe that our operating cash flows and existing cash balances will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements  debt service  and planned capital expenditures  for the next months 
with total working capital of million  and a current ratio of to as of march   management expects liquidity in fiscal to be generated primarily from operating cash flows 
currently unanticipated capital expenditures or business expansion could require the company to identify additional debt or equity funding sources 
the company has used estimates of future financial results including projected revenue  expenses  borrowings  and capital expenditures in reaching its conclusions 
such estimates are subject to change based on future results and such change could cause future results to vary significantly from expected results presented in this form k 
the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to fluctuate materially as it has in the past 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes to our largest customers  weather patterns  increased competition  increased materials  nutrient and energy costs  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  governmental regulations and other factors beyond our control 
in addition  the company maintains product liability insurance only in limited amounts for products involving human consumption because broader product liability coverage is cost prohibitive 
a significant portion of the company s expense levels are relatively fixed  so the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on forecasts of future sales 
if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
we may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management regularly re evaluates its judgments and estimates which are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that of its significant accounting policies  policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are inventory valuations  valuation of equipment and leasehold improvements and long lived assets  and income taxes 
the company records inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is defined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location 
cost for inventory purposes may be determined under any one of several assumptions as to the flow of cost factors  such as first in  first out  average cost  and last in  first out 
our inventories are stated using the first in  first out method 
inventory values are subject to many critical estimates  and unforeseen changes in any of the factors surrounding the estimates imbedded in the determination of inventory values and cost of sales could have a material impact on the company s results 
such changes in factors and estimates include but are not limited to production levels and capacity  changes in the prices paid for raw materials  supplies  and labor  changes in yield  potency  and quality of biomass  changes in processing or production methods  and changes in the carrying value of our inventories resulting from the prices our customers are willing to pay for our products 
such estimates are revised on a quarterly based on information available at that time 
management reviews inventory levels  inventory turnover  product age and product marketability quarterly to evaluate recoverability and determine if a reserve for inventory is deemed necessary 
at march  an inventory reserve in the amount of  has been recognized 
an inventory reserve was not deemed necessary in the prior fiscal year 
equipment and leasehold improvements are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
self constructed leasehold improvements include design  construction and supervision costs 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to equipment and leasehold improvements when construction is completed and the facilities are placed in service 
long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
judgment is required in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
should the company generate sustained taxable income in the future  management may conclude that a portion or all of the existing valuation allowance is no longer required 

table of contents due to the company s history of losses  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against net deferred tax assets 
management has assessed the impact of uncertain tax positions to be immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that our exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments is not material 
we have two term loans with interest rates that adjust quarterly based on the prime rate 
as such  we are exposed to the interest rate risk whereby a increase in the prime rate would lead to an increase of approximately  in interest expense for the year ending march  based on march  amounts outstanding
