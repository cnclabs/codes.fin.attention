critical accounting estimates and policies although our financial statements necessarily make use of certain accounting estimates by management  we believe that no matters that are the subject of such estimates are so highly uncertain or susceptible to change as to present a significant risk of a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance  except as discussed in the following paragraphs 
the significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements primarily include management s fair value estimates related to notes receivable from tribal governments  and the related evaluation of the recoverability of our investments in contract rights 
various assumptions  principally affecting the timing and  to a lesser extent  the probability of completing our various projects under development and getting them open for business with successful operations  and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact and project specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and current and expected legal  regulatory and economic conditions 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas  if any  where changes in such estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
where recoverability of these assets or planned investments are contingent upon the successful development and management of a project  we evaluate the likelihood that the project will be completed  the prospective market dynamics and how the proposed facilities should compete in that setting in order to forecast future cash flows necessary to recover the recorded value of the assets or planned investment 
in most cases  we engage independent valuation consultants to assist management in preparing and periodically updating market and or feasibility studies for use in the preparation of forecasted cash flows 
we review our conclusions as warranted by changing conditions 

table of contents long term assets related to indian casino projects we account for the advances made to tribes as in substance structured notes at estimated fair value in accordance with the guidance contained in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  investments debt and equity securities and topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
because our right to recover our advances and development costs with respect to indian gaming projects is limited to  and contingent upon  the future net revenues of the proposed gaming facilities  we evaluate the financial opportunity of each potential service arrangement before entering into an agreement to provide financial support for the development of an indian project 
this process includes determining the financial feasibility of the project assuming the project is built  assessing the likelihood that the project will receive the necessary regulatory approvals and funding for construction and operations to commence  and estimating the expected timing of the various elements of the project including commencement of operations 
when we enter into a service or lending arrangement  management has concluded  based on feasibility analyses and legal reviews  that there is a high probability that the project will be completed and that the probable future economic benefit is sufficient to compensate us for our efforts in relation to the perceived financial risks 
in arriving at our initial conclusion of probability  we consider both positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence ordinarily consists not only of project specific advancement or progress  but the advancement of similar projects in the same and other jurisdictions  while negative evidence ordinarily consists primarily of unexpected  unfavorable legal  regulatory or political developments such as adverse actions by legislators  regulators or courts 
such positive and negative evidence is reconsidered at least quarterly 
no asset  including notes receivable or contract rights  related to an indian casino project is recorded on our books unless it is considered probable that the project will be built and will result in an economic benefit sufficient for us to recover the asset 
in initially determining the financial feasibility of the project  we analyze the proposed facilities and their location in relation to market conditions  including customer demographics and existing and proposed competition for the project 
typically  independent consultants are also hired to prepare market and financial feasibility reports 
these reports are reviewed by management and updated periodically as conditions change 
in assessing the probability of completing the project  we also consider the status of the regulatory approval process including whether the federal bureau of indian affairs  or bia  recognizes the tribe  the tribe has the right to acquire land to be used as a casino site  the department of the interior has put the land into trust as a casino site  the tribe has a gaming compact with the state government  the nigc has approved a proposed management agreement  and other legal or political obstacles exist or are likely to occur 
the development phase of each relationship commences with the signing of the respective agreements and continues until the casino is open for business 
thereafter  the management phase of the relationship  governed by the management contract  typically continues for a period of between five to seven years 
seven years is the maximum allowed under federal law 
we make advances to the tribes  recorded as notes receivable  primarily to fund certain portions of the projects  which bear no interest or below market interest until operations commence 
repayment of the notes receivable and accrued interest is only required if the casino is successfully opened and distributable profits are available from the casino operations 
under the management agreement  we typically earn a management fee calculated as a percentage of the net income of the gaming facility 
in addition  repayment of the loans and our management fees are subordinated to certain other financial obligations of the respective operations 
generally  the order of priority of payments from the casinos cash flows is as follows a certain minimum monthly priority payment to the tribe  repayment of various senior debt associated with construction and equipping of the casino with interest accrued thereon  repayment of various debt with interest accrued thereon due to us  management fee to us  other obligations  and the remaining funds distributed to the tribe 

table of contents notes receivable we account for and present our notes receivable from and management agreements with the tribes as separate assets 
under the contractual terms  the notes do not become due and payable unless and until the projects are completed and operational 
however  if our development activity is terminated prior to completion  we generally would retain the right to collect on our notes receivable in the event a casino project is completed by another developer 
because we ordinarily do not consider the stated rate of interest on the notes receivable to be commensurate with the risk inherent in these projects prior to commencement of operations  the estimated fair value of the notes receivable is generally less than the amount advanced 
at the date of each advance  the difference between the estimated fair value of the note receivable and the actual amount advanced is recorded as either an intangible asset contract rights or if the rights were acquired in a separate  unbundled transaction  expensed as period costs of retaining such rights 
subsequent to its effective initial recording at estimated fair value using level inputs  which are defined in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures topic as unobservable inputs that reflect management s estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  the note receivable portion of the advance is adjusted to its current estimated fair value at each balance sheet date  also using level inputs 
we do not adjust notes receivable to an estimated fair value that exceeds the face value of the note plus accrued interest  if any 
due to the uncertainties surrounding the projects  no interest income is recognized in the consolidated financial statements during the development period  but changes in estimated fair value of the notes receivable are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in our statement of operations 
upon opening of the casino  the difference  if any  between the then recorded estimated fair value of the notes receivable  subject to any appropriate impairment adjustments made pursuant to asc topic  receivables  and the amount contractually due under the notes is amortized into income using the effective interest method over the remaining term of the note 
contract rights contract rights are recognized as intangible assets related to the acquisition of the management agreements and periodically evaluated for impairment based on the estimated cash flows from the management contract on an undiscounted basis and amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of seven years or contractual lives of the agreements  typically beginning upon commencement of casino operations 
in the event the carrying value of the intangible assets were to exceed the undiscounted cash flow  the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets would be charged to operations 
the cash flow estimates for each project were developed based upon published and other information gathered pertaining to the applicable markets 
we have many years of experience in making these estimates and also utilize independent appraisers and feasibility consultants to assist management in developing our estimates 
the cash flow estimates are initially prepared and periodically updated primarily for business planning purposes with the tribes and are secondarily used in connection with our impairment analysis of the carrying value of contract rights  land held for development  and other capitalized costs  if any  associated with our tribal casino projects 
the primary assumptions used in estimating the undiscounted cash flow from the projects include the expected number of class iii gaming devices  table games  and poker tables  and the related estimated win per unit per day wpud 
generally  within reasonably possible operating ranges  our impairment decisions are not particularly sensitive to changes in these assumptions because estimated cash flows greatly exceed the carrying value of the related intangibles and other capitalized costs 
we believe that the primary competitors to our michigan project are the four winds casino in southwestern michigan  five northern indiana riverboats and three downtown detroit casinos 
the detroit casinos published wpud has consistently averaged above the used in our undiscounted cash flow analysis 
in addition  our market analysis assumes the development of another native american casino of approximately equal size by the gun lake tribe approximately hour to the northwest of our facility 
however  the facility currently under development by gun lake is substantially smaller than originally anticipated with only machines 
our michigan project is located approximately miles west of detroit and approximately driving miles northeast of four winds casino  which opened in august near new buffalo  michigan 

table of contents summary of assets related to indian casino projects at december  and  assets associated with tribal casino projects are summarized as follows  with notes receivable presented at their estimated fair value firekeepers notes receivable  tribal governments contract rights  net other projects notes receivable  tribal governments contract rights  net as previously noted  the firekeepers project comprises the majority of long term assets related to indian casino projects 
we have an approved management agreement with the firekeepers development authority  the authority for the development and operation of the firekeepers casino  which provides that we will receive  only from the operations and financing of the project  reimbursement for all advances we have made to the authority and a management fee  after certain distributions to the tribe  equal to of the net revenues of the casino defined effectively as net income prior to management fees for a period of seven years commencing upon opening 
the terms of an amended management agreement were approved by the nigc in april in may  in connection with the project financing  million of the notes receivable was repaid  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the notes receivable of approximately million  which was recorded as an unrealized gain in the first quarter of the remaining million of the note receivable was repaid in february as of december  gem has earned approximately million in management fee income related to august through december firekeepers casino earnings 
we are not obligated to fund the construction phase of our northern cheyenne project in montana 
the recent economic recession and resulting impact on credit availability has significantly decreased the likelihood that financing could be obtained on favorable terms if at all for the montana project in the foreseeable future 
the company intends to continue working with the northern cheyenne nation to pursue the development of a casino near lame deer  montana  however  based on current economic conditions the company has determined that both the timing and feasibility of this project has become more difficult to determine 
as a result  we believe that the project assets are impaired and collectability is doubtful and the notes receivable originally valued at million and contract rights originally valued at million related to the project were written down to zero value as of december   which resulted in an million impairment loss 
on march   we announced that we are no longer pursuing the namb pueblo project 
as of december   we have advanced million for the development of the project  all of which is expected to be reimbursed by the pueblo through revenues from future gaming operations  if developed 
the estimated fair value of the receivable from the pueblo is now based on the assumption that the pueblo will develop a smaller scope project travel center and will repay the advances over a five year period after the project opens with interest at prime plus as per our agreement 
however  the collectability ultimately depends on the successful development and operation of the project  which we have no influence over  and accordingly  we have discounted the payment stream using a discount rate 
accordingly  management believes that the namb pueblo has the intent and will likely have the ability to repay the advances from future cash flows of the project once open 
during february  we were advised that the pueblo had located a willing financial source to fund the gaming development 
funding is expected during the first quarter of with the expected facility opening within seven months of receipt of funding 
there can be no assurance that a facility will open or that we will receive all or part of the reimbursement 

table of contents due to the absence of observable market quotes on our notes receivable from tribal governments  management develops inputs based on the best information available  including internally developed data  such as estimates of future interest rates  discount rates and casino opening dates as discussed below 
the estimated fair value of our notes receivable related to tribal casino projects make up approximately of our total assets  and are the only assets in our financial statements that are reported at estimated fair value 
changes in the estimated fair value of our notes receivable are reported as unrealized gains losses  which affect reported net income  but do not affect cash flows 
the key assumptions and information used to estimate the fair value of the notes receivable for all projects at december  included a total aggregate face amount of the note receivable of million 
the estimated years until opening and discount rates of the firekeepers and montana projects were 
and years and and  respectively 
as of december   the fair value of the million face amount firekeepers notes receivable  plus interest at prime plus  accrued from the opening date of august   was estimated assuming a discount rate and payment date of february also as of december   the fair value of the million face amount montana notes receivable  originally valued at million and estimated assuming an opening date of years and a discount rate  was written down to zero value as we believe that the project assets are impaired and collectability is doubtful 
also as of december   the fair value of the million face amount namb notes receivable was estimated assuming an opening date of 
years and a discount rate 
for the portion of the notes not repaid prior to the commencement of operations  management estimates that the stated interest rates during the loan repayment terms will be commensurate with the inherent risk at that time 
the estimated probability rates have been re evaluated and modified accordingly  based on project specific risks such as delays of regulatory approvals for the projects and review of the financing environment 
the estimated casino opening dates used in the valuations take into account project specific circumstances such as ongoing litigation  the status of required regulatory approvals  construction periods and other factors 
factors that we consider in arriving at a discount rate include discount rates typically used by gaming industry investors and appraisers to value individual casino properties outside of nevada and discount rates produced by the widely accepted capital asset pricing model  or capm  using the following key assumptions s p  and year average benchmark investment returns medium term horizon risk premiums  risk free investment return equal to the trailing year average for day treasury bills  investment beta factor equal to the unlevered five year average for the hotel gaming industry  and project specific adjustments based on typical size premiums for micro cap and low cap companies using and year averages  and the status of outstanding required regulatory approvals and or litigation  if any 
management believes that under the circumstances  essentially three critical dates and events that impact the project specific discount rate adjustment when using capm are the date that management completes its feasibility assessment and decides to invest in the opportunity  the date that construction financing has been obtained after all legal obstacles have been removed  and the date that operations commence 
amortizations of contract rights are on a straight line basis over the contractual lives of the assets 
the contractual lives may include  or not begin until after  a development period and or the term of the subsequent management agreement 
prior to  the company acquired an interest in contract rights  related to three joint venture projects for million  of which million was allocated to the michigan project for control of the development processes 
accordingly  amortization of these rights commenced immediately with revisions to the development amortization period accounted for prospectively as changes in estimates 
effective august   the remaining contract rights have been amortized on a straight line basis over the seven year term of the gem management contract 
the firekeepers casino opened on august   and as a result  the million of contract rights associated with the firekeepers project began being amortized on august  on a straight line basis over the seven year term of the gem management agreement 
due to the financing and development arrangement for the michigan project through gem  a owned joint venture  we believe we were exposed to the majority of risk of economic loss from the joint venture s development activities 
therefore  in accordance with asc topic  consolidation  we consider the joint venture to be a variable interest entity that requires consolidation in our financial statements 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements no recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted are expected to have a material impact on the company s future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations a significant portion of our revenue is generated from our management agreements with the harrington casino in delaware and the firekeepers casino in michigan 
the delaware contract ends in august and the michigan contract ends in august there can be no assurance that either contract will be extended 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues from continuing operations 
for  total operating revenues from continuing operations increased million or  as compared to  primarily due to the million of management fees recognized in  related to the operations of firekeepers casino  which opened in august the increase in operating revenues was offset by a decrease in casino and food and beverage revenues of million or we believe the decline in revenues at stockman s is consistent with and results primarily from the general economic weakness in churchill county  nevada  since our market share of slot win increased from in to in operating costs and expenses from continuing operations 
for  total operating costs and expenses increased million  or as compared to  primarily due to an increase in contract rights amortization of million or related to firekeepers beginning in august  offset by a decrease in stockman s casino and food and beverage expenses of million or due to the decline in sales volume and general cost control efforts 
project development costs 
for  project development costs increased  or  as compared to  primarily due to an increase of million related to new business development  offset by lower project development expenses related to gem of million  or due to the opening of the project  firekeepers casino 
selling  general and administrative expense 
for  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  as compared to mainly due to increased cash incentive compensation expense at the corporate level of million  offset by reduced stock compensation of million 
the increase in cash incentive compensation expense is due to the successful opening of the firekeepers project and subsequent achievement of management fee targets 
operating gains losses 
for  operating gains decreased by million  or 
the decrease is primarily due to the million gem member agreement modification signed in october  in september  payables due from gem to each member were adjusted to reflect a total payable due to ram of million  including million reported as equity  and a total payable due to the company of million  including million reported as equity  resulting in the recognition of a net pre tax gain of million 
the net pre tax gain is distributed gross on the statements of operations for the period ended december   as a million charge characterized as a member agreement modification offset by a million credit attributable to the non controlling interest 
also operating gains decreased due to lower unrealized gain on notes receivables by million  primarily due to a million gain for gem in the prior year related to the repayment of million of the tribal receivable 

table of contents other income expense 
for  other income increased by million  or consisting of an increase of interest and other income of million or  related to the accrued interest on the million receivable from firekeepers 
interest expense decreased million  or due to the reduction in interest expense related to the reduction of outstanding debt on the company s revolving line of credit and the pay off of the promissory note to peters family trust 
income taxes 
for  the effective income tax rate is approximately  compared to for the same period in the decrease in the effective tax rate from is primarily due to equity compensation deductions  along with a reduced proportion of state taxable income when compared to total taxable income 
there is no valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of  as of december  and management believes the deferred tax asset is fully realizable 
non controlling interest 
for  the income attributable to non controlling interest in consolidated joint venture increased by million or 
the increase is attributable to ram s share of the increased net income in gem of million as compared to the gem increased net income was due primarily to the approximately million in management fee income earned  related to the firekeepers casino 
liquidity and capital resources the united states has experienced a widespread and severe recession accompanied by  among other things  weakness in the commercial and investment banking systems resulting in reduced credit and capital financing availability  and highly curtailed gaming and other recreational activities and general discretionary consumer spending  and is also engaged in war  all of which have far reaching effects on economic conditions in the country for an indeterminate period 
the effects and duration of these conditions and related risks and uncertainties on the company s future operations and cash flows  including its access to capital or credit financing  cannot be estimated at this time  but may likely be significant 
harrington raceway and casino  firekeepers casino and stockman s casino are currently our primary sources of recurring income and significant positive cash flow 
our management agreement for the harrington casino in delaware ends in august and our management agreement for the firekeepers casino in michigan end in august there can be no assurance that either agreement will be extended 
under the management agreement for firekeepers casino  certain distributions must be paid from net revenue prior to the payment of the management fee to us 
in addition  although the timing of completion is currently unclear  the gun lake tribe has commenced construction of a casino approximately a one hour drive northwest of firekeepers casino  which  when completed  may affect the revenues of firekeepers casino and ultimately our management fee 
gem began earning management fees from firekeepers casino in the third quarter of  with the first payments made in september 
distributions from the delaware operation are governed by the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement and management reorganization agreement 
the total amount distributed from the delaware operations for the year ended december  and to us was million and million  respectively  which is a increase from prior year 
we expect to continue receiving management fees as currently prescribed under the joint venture agreement  with a minimum guaranteed growth factor over the prior year of in years through august the cash distributions increased in  as compared to the minimum guaranteed growth factor as prescribed under the joint venture agreement  due to the fact that the growth factor represents cash distributed for the year earned and the represents the cash distributed during the year  reflecting timing differences 
on a consolidated basis  for  cash provided by operations increased million over prior year primarily due to the firekeepers management fees 
cash provided by investing activities decreased million from the prior year primarily due to cash proceeds generated from the sale of the holiday inn express in february of million and the repayment of tribal advances related to the firekeepers project of million in may in the prior year period  the primary use of cash for investing activities related to the purchases of contract rights 
cash used in financing activities decreased million primarily due to decreased repayments of long term debt 
as of december   the company had approximately million in cash and availability on its revolving credit facility of million 

table of contents our future cash requirements include selling  general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures primarily at stockman s and debt service 
subject to the economic uncertainties discussed above  we believe that adequate financial resources will be available to execute our current growth plan from a combination of operating cash flows and external debt and equity financing 
however  continued downward pressure on cash flow from operations due to  among other reasons  the adverse effects of the current economic environment and or the lack of available funding sources due to  among other reasons  the recent unprecedented global contraction in available credit increases uncertainty with respect to our development and growth plans 
long term debt includes a reducing revolving loan from nevada state bank 
the maximum committed amount under the revolver was increased from million to million  based upon the amendment to the revolver dated june  and the repayment terms were amended as discussed below 
the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding under the revolver decreased  on july  effective january   based upon the amendment to the revolver  the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding decreases  semiannually on january and july of each year and any outstanding amounts above such reduced maximum must be repaid on each such date 
the reducing revolving loan is payable over years at a variable interest rate based on the five year libor swap rate plus 
this rate  which was per annum as of december  and per annum as of december   adjusts annually based on the funded debt to ebitda ratio of stockman s  with adjustments based on the five year libor swap rate occurring every five years 
with the sale of the holiday inn express in february  the balance on the loan was reduced from million to million  and the company s availability under the facility increased to approximately million 
in addition  periodic payment requirements were reduced on a pro rata basis 
on october   the company paid additional principal of million 
in march   the company made million of voluntary principal payments on its revolving credit line  increasing the availability under the line to million 
the remaining balance of million was paid on november   and the line of credit availability as of december  was million 
the loan agreement with nevada state bank also contains customary financial representations and warranties and requires that stockman s maintain specified financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio  a funded debt to ebitda ratio and a minimum tangible net worth 
in addition  the loan agreement limits the amount of distributions from and capital expenditures by stockman s 
the loan agreement also provides for customary events of default including payment defaults and covenant defaults 
the company is in technical default of a loan covenant that requires stockmans to maintain a minimum tangible net worth based on an annually increasing calculation and has applied for a waiver  which management expects to be approved based on stockman casino s performance  our cash balance and the fact that we have fully repaid the nevada state bank loan 
the technical default does not affect our line of credit availability and we have access to the full credit line amount 
on june  the company paid off the peters family trust promissory note of million plus  in accrued interest with a drawdown of the revolver 
the original amount of the promissory note was million  payable to the seller of stockman s over monthly installments of principal and interest and was secured by a second lien in the real estate of stockman s 
effective july  the second lien in the real estate of stockman s was released 
in  gem acquired all of green acres interests in gem for million 
gem s members equally funded an initial deposit and periodic payments of approximately million 
the repayment was funded with million of proceeds received from a partial payment on the notes receivable related to the firekeepers project  which was tied to the construction financing for the project 
the net realizable value of the michigan receivable has been classified as short term  as the remaining million of notes receivable from the authority was paid from the construction disbursement account on february  additional projects are considered based on their forecasted profitability  development period  regulatory and political environment and the ability to secure the funding necessary to complete the development  among other considerations 
as part of our agreements for tribal developments  we typically fund costs associated with projects which may include legal  civil engineering  environmental  design  training  land acquisition and other related advances while assisting the tribes in securing financing for the construction of the project 
the majority of costs are advanced to the tribes and are reimbursable to us  pursuant to management and development agreements  as part of the financing of the project s development 
while each project is unique  we forecast these costs when determining the feasibility of each opportunity 
such agreements to finance costs associated with the development and furtherance of projects are typical in this industry and have become expected of tribal gaming developers

firekeepers project gem  our firekeepers casino joint venture  has the exclusive right to arrange the financing and provide casino management services to the michigan tribe in exchange for a management fee  after certain other distributions are paid to the tribe  of of net revenues defined effectively as net income before management fees for seven years which commenced upon the opening of the firekeepers casino on august  the terms of our management agreement were approved by the nigc in december and a revised management agreement was approved in april in  gem acquired all of green acres interests in gem for million

the remaining million of notes receivable from the authority plus interest was paid in february in  in exchange for funding a portion of the development costs  ram advanced the company million  which was partially convertible into a capital contribution to the gem joint venture upon federal approval of the land into trust application and federal approval of the management agreement with the authority 
subsequently  ram exercised its conversion option on its million loan to the company 
as a result  million of the loan was converted to a capital contribution to the gem joint venture  and the loan balance of million  plus million of accrued interest on the original loan  became a liability of gem 
at december   gem s total liabilities to ram were approximately million  which bear no interest effective september   and are expected to be fully repaid in the first half of for the twelve month period ending december   the company had loaned million and ram had loaned million to gem to fund current operating expenses and million has been repaid to ram from distributable gem income 
on october   effective september   an agreement was reached between the company and ram gem financial resolution clarifying the treatment of the following items reimbursable amounts funded by the members  due from the michigan tribe before the ram buy in as the prior agreements were silent on reimbursements to members 
non reimbursable amounts funded by the company  related to the michigan tribe  as the prior agreements were unclear if these were reimbursable by gem to the company 
repayments of disproportionate advances by the company as prior agreements were unclear as to what percentages would be used regarding repayment 

table of contents as a result  payables due from gem to each member were adjusted to reflect a total payable due to ram of million  including million reported as equity  and a total payable due to the company of million  including million reported as equity  resulting in the recognition of a net pre tax gain million  which was recorded in september the net pre tax gain is distributed gross on the statements of operations for the period ended september   as a million charge characterized as a member agreement modification offset by a million credit attributable to the non controlling interest 
in addition  the gem members agreed that distributions to the members will be made on a basis to both members until such time ram s member payable has been fully repaid and thereafter to the company and to ram until such time as the remaining payable to the company has been repaid 
thereafter  distributions to members will be made on a basis 
also  no further interest accruals will be made on any member payables 
as a result of the gem member agreement  the company has reclassified the due to joint venture affiliate of million as current portion of long term debt with the balance of the ram payable classified as joint venture equity 
for the twelve month period ending december   million has been repaid to ram from gem s approximately million management fee income

the recent economic recession and resulting impact on credit availability has significantly decreased the likelihood that financing could be obtained on favorable terms if at all for the montana project in the foreseeable future 
the company intends to continue working with the northern cheyenne nation to pursue the development of a casino near lame deer  montana  however  based on current economic conditions the company has determined that both the timing and feasibility of this project have become more difficult to determine 
as a result  we believe that the project assets are impaired and collectability is doubtful and the notes receivable originally valued at million and contract rights originally valued at million related to the project were written down to zero value as of december   which resulted in an million impairment loss 
on march   we announced that we are no longer pursuing the namb pueblo project 
as of december   we have advanced million for the development of the project  all of which is expected to be reimbursed by the pueblo through revenues from future gaming operations  if developed 
the estimated fair value of the receivable from the pueblo is now based on the assumption that the pueblo is in the process of developing a small casino addition to their existing travel center and will likely have the ability to repay the advances from future cash flows of the project  once open  over a five year period with interest at prime plus as per our agreement 
however  the collectability ultimately depends on the successful development and operation of the project  which we have no influence over  and accordingly  we have discounted the payment stream using a discount rate 
accordingly  management believes that the namb pueblo has the intent and will likely have the ability to repay the advances from future cash flows of the project once open 
during february  we were advised that the pueblo had located a willing financial source to fund the gaming development 
funding is expected during the first quarter of with the expected facility opening within seven months of receipt of funding 
there can be no assurance that a facility will open or that we will receive all or part of the reimbursement 

table of contents additional projects are considered based on management s forecasts of their profitability  development period  regulatory and political environment and the ability to secure the funding necessary to complete the development  among other considerations 
as part of our agreements for tribal developments  we typically fund costs associated with projects which may include legal  civil engineering  environmental  design  training  land acquisition and other related advances while assisting the tribes in securing financing for the construction of the project 
the majorities of these costs are advanced to the tribes and are reimbursable to us  pursuant to management and development agreements  as part of the financing of the project s development 
while each project is unique  we forecast these costs when determining the feasibility of each opportunity 
such agreements to finance costs associated with the development and furtherance of projects are typical in this industry and have become expected of tribal gaming developers 
our agreements with the various indian tribes contain limited waivers of sovereign immunity and  in many cases  provide for arbitration to enforce the agreements 
generally  our only recourse for collection of funds under these agreements is from revenues  if any  of prospective casino operations 
at december   the notes receivable from indian tribes have been discounted approximately million below the contractual value of the notes and the related contract rights are valued substantially below the anticipated cash flow from the management fees of the projects 
on may   the authority closed on the sale of million of senior secured notes and a million equipment financing facility to fund the development and construction of the tribe s firekeepers casino in michigan 
on the same date  gem received a payment of approximately million on its notes receivable from the authority and the remaining million was paid february  on may   gem funded million in financing costs on behalf of the authority  as required by the management agreement  which was recorded as additional gaming rights related to the michigan project 
the company and ram each contributed one half of the funds to gem for gem to make this funding 
the firekeepers casino commenced operations on august  the company continues to actively investigate  individually and with partners  new business opportunities 
management believes they will have sufficient cash and financing available to fund acquisitions and development opportunities in the future
