table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption item a 
risk factors 
overview background we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel  small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical need with a specific focus on the us market 
through strategic alliances primarily with japanese pharmaceutical companies  we hold rights to a diversified portfolio of clinical and preclinical product candidates  each of which we believe has a well characterized and differentiated therapeutic profile  attractive commercial potential and patent assets having claims of commercially adequate scope 
we are a development stage company 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
at december   from inception  our accumulated deficit was approximately million  including million of non cash stock based compensation charges related to employee stock based compensation and founders warrants 
we expect to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop certain of our existing product development programs  primarily mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and copd exacerbations  and over the long term if we are successful in expanding our research and development programs and acquiring or in licensing products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
we have acquired licenses to eight compounds for the development of ten product candidates 
our development pipeline consists of eight product development programs which have been in clinical development for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma  ms  bronchial asthma  ic  solid tumor cancers  generalized anxiety disorders insomnia  preterm labor and urinary incontinence  and two product development programs which have been in preclinical development for the treatment of thrombotic disorders 
in addition  we have expanded our development program for mn for the treatment of copd exacerbations 
in december we acquired avigen  a biopharmaceutical company that has focused on identifying and developing differentiated products to treat patients with serious disorders  whose potential product candidate is av  a glial attenuator  for cns disorders  such as neuropathic pain  and opioid withdrawal and methamphetamine addiction 
av and mn are both ibudalist  an orally available  small molecule therapeutic 
with the acquisition of av  we intend to integrate the two ibudalist based product development programs and pursue discussions with potential partners to secure a strategic collaboration to advance clinical development of the combined development programs 
avigen transaction on december   absolute merger  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  merged with and into avigen with avigen continuing as the surviving entity and wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
we refer to this transaction as the merger 
at the effective time of the merger  each share of avigen s common stock and the associated preferred stock purchase right was cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive either cash  convertible notes or a combination of both in an amount equal to the first payment consideration as defined below and the second payment consideration as defined below and one contingent payment right  or cpr  granting the holder thereof the rights as described under the section entitled contingent payment rights below 

table of contents the first payment consideration  which was approximately per share of avigen s common stock  was equal to  divided by  the number of shares of avigen s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger 
the second payment consideration is equal to the amount remaining in the escrow account described below following satisfaction of the demand amount as defined below  as adjusted by the selected amount as defined below 
escrow agreement under the terms of the escrow agreement  or escrow agreement  entered into at the closing of the merger  we and avigen funded  in an escrow account 
after closing  we also deposited into the escrow account certain payments  including certain cash amounts that exceed specified amounts agreed upon by the parties 
we avigen and us identified certain additional liabilities of approximately  prior to closing of the merger 
at the closing of the merger  andrew a 
sauter  avigen s former chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as the stockholder representative appointed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the escrow agreement  authorized the release of  from the escrow agreement in satisfaction of these additional liabilities 
as a result  the second payment consideration is estimated to be no more than approximately million  or per share 
on or prior to june   we will be entitled to submit one demand certificate to claim all or a portion of the funds in the escrow account  or demand amount  with respect to certain additional liabilities  including liabilities in excess of specified amounts agreed upon by the parties 
upon delivery of the demand certificate  amounts in the escrow account that are not being demanded in satisfaction of additional liabilities will be released to avigen s former stockholders on a pro rata basis 
the stockholder representative will be entitled to dispute the demand amount  and provision has been made in the escrow agreement for an independent accounting firm to resolve any unresolved dispute between us and the stockholder representative with respect to the demand amount 
amounts disputed will not be distributed until the dispute is resolved  and the timing of the full distribution of the second payment consideration is therefore subject to delay 
following resolution of the dispute regarding the demand amount  which requires the independent accounting firm to select either the amount demanded by us or the amount of such demand as adjusted by the amounts contested by the stockholder representative as the numerical amount it believes is the accurate amount of additional liabilities  or selected amount  we will receive an amount reflecting any adjustments resulting from the selected amount 
any remaining amounts in the escrow account then will be released to avigen s former stockholders on a pro rata basis 
indenture at the closing of the merger  we and american stock transfer trust company  llc  as trustee  entered into an indenture 
under the terms of a separate trust agreement  or trust agreement  million  which represents the first payment consideration less million paid out to avigen shareholders who elected cash payment and the initial principal amount of the convertible notes  or convertible notes  was deposited with a trust agent for the benefit of the holders and us the amount of such deposit together with interest accrued and capitalized thereon  the property 
provided no event of default has occurred and is continuing  we will be able to direct the investment and reinvestment of the property in certain approved investment options  including certain money market funds 
at the maturity of the convertible notes on june   the month anniversary of the closing of the merger  we will use the property to pay the principal amount of  and accrued interest on  the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are our secured obligations  and the indenture does not limit other indebtedness of ours  secured or unsecured 
the indenture contains limited covenants  including a requirement that we deliver to holders of the convertible notes quarterly statements setting forth the principal amount of the convertible notes at the close of the fiscal quarter as well as information regarding the amount of interest capitalized to such convertible notes during the fiscal quarter 

table of contents holders of the convertible notes may submit conversion notices  which are irrevocable  instructing the trustee to convert such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
following each conversion date  which date generally is the final business day of each calendar month  we will issue the number of whole shares of common stock issuable upon conversion as promptly as practicable and in any event within business days 
any fractional shares after aggregating all convertible notes being converted by a holder on such date will be rounded down and we will deliver cash out of the separate trust for the current market value of the fractional share 
the indenture includes customary anti dilution adjustments and events of default 
contingent payment rights at the closing of the merger  we  avigen and american stock transfer trust company  llc  as rights agent  entered into a contingent payment rights agreement  or cpr agreement 
the cpr agreement sets forth the rights that former avigen stockholders will have with respect to each cpr held after the closing of the merger 
the cpr agreement provides for the payment of the following amounts on a pro rata basis if the first milestone payment under avigen s agreement with genzyme  or the genzyme agreement  is received before august    or such lesser cash amount paid by genzyme  if the first milestone payment has not occurred and the parkinson s product  as defined in the genzyme agreement  is sold or otherwise disposed of by us before august   percent of the net proceeds of such sale or disposition received before august   and if the trust established pursuant to avigen s management transition plan is terminated  the amount remaining in such trust upon termination less any payments required to be made under avigen s management transition plan trust agreement  such amount currently estimated at all payments will be made on a pro rata basis 
in each case  the payments will be net of any related taxes and out of pocket costs  damages  fines  penalties and expenses incurred by us 
the cprs are not transferable  except in limited circumstances 
revenues and cost of revenues we recognized no revenues for each of the years in the three year period ended december  research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of the license fees related to our product candidates  salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  costs associated with non clinical activities  such as regulatory expenses  and pre commercialization manufacturing development activities 
we use external service providers to manufacture our product candidates to be used in clinical trials and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  therefore  these research and development expenses consist substantially of external costs  such as fees paid to consultants  contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and other external service providers  including professional fees and costs associated with legal services  patents and patent applications for our intellectual property 
internal research and development expenses consist of costs of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies  materials  facility costs and depreciation 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 

table of contents the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated for each of our product candidates 
to the extent that costs  including personnel costs  are not tracked to a specific product development program  such costs are included in the unallocated category in thousands product candidate disease indication year ended december  mn acute exacerbations of asthma and copd mn av multiple sclerosis other cns disorders mn bronchial asthma mn interstitial cystitis mn solid tumors mn generalized anxiety disorder insomnia mn preterm labor mn urinary incontinence mn thrombotic disorders mn thrombotic disorders unallocated total research and development as of the end of the second quarter of  we determined to focus our resources on the development of our two prioritized product candidates  mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and mn for the treatment of ms 
however  following completion of the phase ii clinical trial of mn ibudalist for the treatment of ms in the second quarter of and the december acquisition of av ibudalist for the treatment of other cns disorders  we plan to combine the two ibudalist based development programs and pursue discussions with potential partners to secure a strategic collaboration 
as such  we have not undertaken  nor do we plan to undertake  any further significant clinical development of mn av until such time that we secure a strategic collaboration to advance the combined ibudalist based development program 
in addition  as of the third quarter of  we determined to expand the product development program for mn to evaluate mn for the treatment of copd exacerbations 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase with respect to mn in future periods as we continue development and launch clinical trials in support of potential commercialization of this product candidate for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and copd exacerbations and decrease with respect to mn av in future periods as we will limit expenditures on this product candidate to those development activities deemed necessary  if any  to maximize its value for purposes of securing a partner for clinical development 
however  at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical development process and given the early stage of our mn product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in the continued development of such product candidate for potential commercialization 
we intend to limit our expenditures on the remainder of our existing product candidates to only those activities deemed necessary to maintain our license rights or maximize the value of such product candidates  if any  while pursuing a variety of initiatives to monetize such product candidates on appropriate terms 
as a result  we expect that research and development expenses will decrease or otherwise remain low for the remainder of our existing product candidates in future periods 
these eight non prioritized product development programs consist of the following mn for the treatment of bronchial asthma  for which we initiated a phase iii clinical program in the fourth quarter of that we subsequently terminated in the second quarter of and for which we developed prototypes of once per day oral dosing formulations  mn for the treatment of ic  for which we completed a phase ii iii clinical trial in the first quarter of  
table of contents mn for the treatment of solid tumors  for which we completed one phase i clinical trial in the second quarter of and one phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of  mn for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder insomnia  for which we completed a phase ii iii clinical trial for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in the second quarter of and a phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of insomnia in the fourth quarter of  mn for the treatment of preterm labor  for which we completed a phase i clinical trial to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of mn in healthy pregnant women not in labor in the second quarter of mn for the treatment of urinary incontinence  for which we completed a phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of and a phase i food effects study in the first quarter of  mn for the treatment of thrombotic disorders  which remains in preclinical development  and mn for the treatment of thrombotic disorders  which remains in preclinical development 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries  benefits and consulting and professional fees related to our administrative  finance  human resources  business development  legal and information systems support functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include facilities and insurance costs 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on monitoring the status of the specified project  contractual factors such as milestones or retainer fees  services provided and invoices received 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  general and administrative accruals have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if we are required to expand our infrastructure based on the success of our current prioritized product development programs and in raising capital to support those and other development programs or otherwise in connection with increased business development activities related to partnering  out licensing or disposition of our product candidates 
investment securities and ars put our investment securities consist of ars  all of which had aaa ratings at the time of original purchase 
ars are generally long term debt instruments that historically have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  typically seven   or days 
all of our ars principally represent interests in municipal bonds  government guaranteed student loans  insurance notes and portfolios of securities primarily commercial paper 
when our ars were originally purchased  there was an active market for purchasing and selling ars  therefore  we considered these investment securities to be available for sale 
due to continued negative conditions in the global credit markets  our ars have continued to fail at auction with few to no trades in either the primary or the secondary markets 
as such  with the adoption of accounting standards codification  or asc   authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures formerly statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 we determine the fair value of our ars portfolio primarily on level criteria  which results in our reliance on a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions related to interest rates  maturities and liquidity determined by us based on the credit quality of the security  the credit quality of the associated insurer  if applicable  the respective prospectus and the credit market outlook 
given the lack of a primary and secondary market for our ars investment securities  we designated all of our ars investment securities as trading securities at december  as a result  any additional increase or decrease in the fair value of our ars investment securities is recorded as either a gain or an impairment charge  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended 
table of contents december   we recorded a net gain on our investment securities of million to increase the overall carrying value of our investment securities 
we have classified our investment securities covered by the ars rights offer as described below as current assets given that they can be converted into cash within twelve months from december  our remaining investment securities are considered long term assets  as they cannot be readily converted to cash within months from december  in august  ubs  the brokerage firm through which we purchased the majority of our ars  entered into a settlement with the sec  the new york attorney general and other state agencies 
under the settlement  ubs issued to us auction rate security rights  which would allow us to sell to ubs our ars held in accounts with ubs  or the ars rights offer 
pursuant to the ars rights offer  we received the right to sell to ubs the ars held in accounts with ubs at par value at any time during the period beginning june  and ending july   or the ars put 
as part of the settlement  ubs also offered to us a no net cost loan program  or ars loan  whereby we would be able to borrow up to percent of the market value  as determined by ubs at its sole discretion  of our ars that have been pledged as collateral at an interest cost that would not exceed the interest being paid on the underlying ars investments 
under the terms of the ars loan  ubs may demand full or partial payment of the ars loan  at its sole option and without cause  at any time 
if at any time ubs exercises its right to terminate the credit line agreement governing the ars loan  then ubs is required to provide  as soon as reasonably possible  alternative financing on substantially the same terms and conditions as those under the credit line agreement and the agreement will remain in full force and effect until such time as such alternative financing has been established 
in january  we were approved for the ars loan in the amount of million and drew down the entire preapproved amount 
in addition  in february  we borrowed an additional million under the ars loan  bringing the total amount outstanding under the ars loan to million  following ubs decision to increase our availability under the ars loan 
all cash received under the ars loan was invested in money market accounts 
at december   the outstanding balance of the ars loan was million 
although we have the right to sell to ubs the ars subject to the ars put at par beginning june   we determined the fair market value of the ars without consideration of the ars put because they are deemed separate contractual agreements under asc we elected to measure the ars put under the fair value option of asc  authoritative guidance on financial instruments formerly sfas no 
 to mitigate the volatility in reported earnings due to the linkage of certain of our ars and the ars put 
under asc  any subsequent increase or decrease in the fair value of the ars put would be recorded as either a gain or an impairment charge  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the ars put was also determined by a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions being made related to interest rate  maturity and liquidity 
for the year ended december   based on our discounted cash flow valuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million in our consolidated statement of operations due to a decrease in the carrying value of the ars put to million 
the net gain on our investment securities and ars put was million for the year ended december   which we recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
foreign exchange loss to date  we have conducted most of our clinical trials in the united states 
however  the phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of ms was conducted in eastern europe 
when we entered into the euro denominated contract with the cro managing this clinical trial on our behalf  the us dollar to euro conversion rate had remained fairly constant  therefore  we did not enter into a hedging program to mitigate our foreign exchange exposure at such time 
we completed this clinical trial in the second quarter of our foreign exchange loss in is primarily attributable to the decline in the value of the us dollar against the euro on the accrued payable for this foreign currency denominated contract 
at december   the accrued payable had been settled 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to our significant accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting estimates include our recognition of research and development expenses  which impacts operating expenses and accrued liabilities  and stock based compensation  which impacts operating expenses 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to further our research and development activities and include salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials  costs associated with non clinical activities such as toxicology testing  regulatory activities  research related overhead expenses and fees paid to external service providers who conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf 
we use external service providers and vendors to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other products and services related to our product development programs 
research and development expenses also include fees for licensed technology for which technological feasibility has not been established and there are no alternative uses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our amended and restated stock incentive plan 
additionally  we have outstanding stock options that were granted under our general stock incentive plan 
the benefits provided under both of these plans requires stock based compensation for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and employee stock purchase rights  issued to employees to be recognized as a cost in the consolidated financial statements 
the cost of these awards is measured according to the grant date fair value of the stock award and is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock award  the grant date fair value of the award would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
valuation of our stock option grants require us to estimate certain variables  such as estimated volatility and expected life 
if any of our estimations change  such changes could have a significant impact on the stock based compensation amount we recognize 

table of contents stock option compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years 
business combinations our consolidated financial statements include an acquired business operations after the completion of the acquisition 
we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting 
the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses requires  among other things  that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in process research and development ipr d be recorded on the balance sheet 
also  transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note avigen transaction for further information on ipr d and goodwill 
fair value measurements we are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value  either upon initial measurement or for subsequent accounting or reporting 
we use fair value extensively in the initial measurement of net assets acquired in a business combination and when accounting for and reporting on investment securities and certain financial instruments or assets 
we estimate fair value using an exit price approach  which requires  among other things  that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market of market participants  considering the highest and best use of assets and  for liabilities  assuming the risk of non performance will be the same before and after the transfer 
many  but not all  of our financial instruments are carried at fair value 
in addition  as required under accounting rules for business combinations  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from avigen on december  have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
for additional information on the valuation approach to determine fair value  including a description of the inputs used  see long lived assets below and notes to consolidated financial statements note avigen transaction 
also  for information on fair value for our financial instruments  see notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements other than intangibles and goodwill 
long lived assets and impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including property and equipment  and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable and we perform impairment testing for goodwill and ipr d annually 
when it is determined that impairment has occurred  a charge to operations will be recorded 
impairment on property and equipment or other intangible assets  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
impairment on goodwill is assessed on our overall market capitalization  as we operate under one reporting segment 
impairment on ipr d is assessed on a fair value cost approach 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in october  the fasb ratified accounting standards update  or asu   which eliminates the residual method of allocation and the requirement to use the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  companies shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
asu shall be effective in fiscal years 
table of contents beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
companies may elect to adopt this guidance prospectively for all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption  or retrospectively for all periods presented 
we do not believe the adoption of this accounting standard will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued asu no 
 derivatives and hedging topic scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives 
the fasb believes this asu clarifies the type of embedded credit derivative that is exempt from embedded derivative bifurcation requirements 
specifically  only one form of embedded credit derivative qualifies for the exemption one that is related only to the subordination of one financial instrument to another 
as a result  entities that have contracts containing an embedded credit derivative feature in a form other than such subordination may need to separately account for the embedded credit derivative feature 
the amendments in the asu are effective for each reporting entity at the beginning of its first fiscal quarter beginning after june  early adoption is permitted at the beginning of each entity s first fiscal quarter beginning after march  we do not believe the adoption of this accounting standard will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues for the year ended december  or december  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in research and development expenses primarily resulted from the following a decrease of million due to the completion of the two year phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of ms  a decrease of million related primarily to the completion of clinical trials for mn for the treatment of solid tumors and other non prioritized assets  and a decrease of million in research and development personnel costs not tracked to a specific development program  which decrease was offset primarily by a net increase of million related to the conduct of phase ii clinical trials for mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and copd 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily related to expenses in connection with the avigen transaction  including expenses related to legal fees to review and draft the merger agreement and related registration statement  accounting fees related to review of and consent for the related registration statement  the cost of the fairness opinion  and printing and mailing costs related to the special shareholders meeting needed to approve the avigen transaction 

table of contents gain impairment charge on investment securities and ars put for the year ended december   we recorded a net gain of million on our investment securities and ars put  as compared to a net impairment charge of million for the year ended december  the net gain in on our investment securities and ars put is primarily due to a change in assumed maturity in our discounted cash flow valuation analysis 
in we utilized a five year assumed maturity on our ars subject to ubs settlement  as opposed to a seven year assumed maturity in the change in assumed maturity was based on the outlook for the ars market 
foreign exchange loss foreign exchange loss was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  when compared  for the year ended december  the decrease in foreign exchange loss was due to less weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the settlement of the foreign currency denominated contract 
other income  net other income  net consisted of interest income earned on our cash and investment balances and totaled  for the year ended december   a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest earned on most of our cash and investment balances due to lower interest rates as a result of the continued economic downturn 
in addition  during the year ended december    of interest expense was recorded on the ars loan 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues for the year ended december  or december  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses primarily resulted from our business decision to focus on the development of our two prioritized assets  mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and mn for the treatment of ms 
this decrease in research and development expenses primarily resulted from the following a decrease of million related to the termination of a phase iii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of bronchial asthma  a decrease of million related to the completion of the phase ii clinical trial for insomnia and the ceased further clinical development of mn for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder insomnia  and a decrease of million due to the completion of the two year phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of ms  and a decrease of million related primarily to the completion of clinical trials for mn for the treatment of solid tumors  mn for the treatment of preterm labor and mn for the treatment of urinary incontinence  which decrease was offset primarily by a net increase of million related to the conduct of phase ii clinical trials for mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in stock based compensation and a million decrease related to reduced administrative headcount and fees paid to third party consultants 
impairment charge  net on long term investments and ars put for the year ended december   we recorded a million other than temporary write down of the carrying value of our ars based upon a discounted cash flow valuation analysis of our entire ars portfolio conducted on a security by security basis  the outlook of the ars market and our expectation as to when we may be required to liquidate our ars for operating purposes  which was offset by a gain of million recognized on the ars put which is linked to certain of our ars 
foreign exchange loss at december   the conversion rate was approximately us dollars for each euro  which approximated the conversion rate at the time we entered into the contract with the cro managing our phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of ms which was completed in the second quarter of at december   the conversion rate was approximately us dollars for each euro  and we reduced the accrued liability related to this clinical research contract based on reconciliations performed through year end 
this resulted in a million foreign exchange loss related to the revaluation of our euro denominated liability for the year ended december  other income other income primarily consisted of interest income earned on our cash and investment balances and totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in our investment balances and overall lower yields on our investments due to the economic recession 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  investment securities current and an ars put  net of ars loan  as compared to million of cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and a long term asset consisting of the ars put as of december   which decrease of million was primarily a result of our million payment to acquire avigen and our operating loss of million  offset by noncash expenses 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and a long term asset consisting of the ars put as compared to million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale at december   which decrease of million was primarily a result of our operating loss of million 
restricted cash and letter of credit of million would be included in our liquidity analysis and capital resources upon the conversion of the associated convertible notes into our stock 
through march we issued a total of  shares of our stock as a result of notes conversions and  accordingly  a total of approximately million was transferred from restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in operating activities amounted to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the net loss incurred during the year ended december  of million 
in addition  million of cash used in operating activities was directly related to the avigen transaction 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  consisted of the net cash used to 
table of contents acquire avigen  offset by the net maturities sales of investment securities 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the net proceeds received from our ars loan of million 
our future capital uses and requirements will depend on  and could increase significantly as a result of  many forward looking factors  including the following progress of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  including expenses to support the clinical development of mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and milestone payments that may become payable to kissei pharmaceutical based on the progress of such product development program  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements  the scope  prioritization and number of our product development programs  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical and commercial production of our product candidates  the costs of establishing sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization activities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our product candidates  and the extent to which we may in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through strategic collaborations  private or public sales of our securities  debt financings or licensing transactions  involving all or a portion of our product candidates  to the extent we are able to do so 
we cannot be certain that additional sources of capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if sources of capital are not available  we may not be in a position to pursue present or future business opportunities that require financial commitments  and we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or terminate one or more of our product development programs or our commercialization efforts  curtail our efforts to acquire new product candidates or relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates 
sources of liquidity since our inception  our operations have been financed primarily through the private placement of our equity securities and through the public sale of our common stock  net of treasury stock repurchases 
over the three years ended december   we have completed the following sales of equity securities on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and certain other costs associated with the offering 
in january  a founder exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share in a cashless exercise that resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
in september  a founder exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share in a cashless exercise that resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
at december   no underlying shares of common stock remained subject to purchase under the terms of the founders warrants 

table of contents auction rate securities 
at december   our investment securities both current and long term totaled million at par value of ars 
with the continued negative conditions in the global credit markets  these ars have experienced multiple failed auctions  as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result of the failed auctions  these securities are currently not liquid in the primary market 
the majority of our ars are secured by parts of government guaranteed student loans  and all of our ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms generally basis points over the day us treasury bill rate or basis points over libor with interest rates resetting every seven to days 
while it is not our intent to hold our ars until their ultimate stated maturities  these securities are scheduled to mature between and because an active primary market for ars does not exist  we utilized a discounted cash flow valuation model utilizing liquidity discounts ranging from two percent to percent to determine the estimated fair value of our ars investments on a security by security basis 
we also took into consideration the brokerage firm s pricing model  if applicable  the tax status taxable vs 
tax exempt of the security  credit quality of the issuer  assumed maturity primarily five years  insurance wraps and the portfolio composition 
we also made assumptions regarding future cash flows and the likelihood of the ars being redeemed or refinanced 
in we modified the assumed maturity of student loan backed ars to five years from seven years due to the outlook of the credit markets 
with the change is assumed maturity  for the year ended december  we have recognized a net gain of million in our consolidated statement of operations as the investment securities are designated as trading securities 
the carrying value of our investment securities at december  was million and the carrying value of our ars put as described below was million 
ars rights offer  ars put and ars loan 
in august  ubs  the brokerage firm through which we purchased the majority of our ars investments  entered into a settlement with the sec  the new york attorney general and other state agencies 
under the settlement  ubs issued to us the ars rights offer 
pursuant to the ars rights offer  we received the ars put 
as part of the settlement  ubs also offered to us the ars loan  whereby we would be able to borrow up to percent of the market value  as determined by ubs at its sole discretion  of our ars that have been pledged as collateral at an interest cost that would not exceed the interest being paid on the underlying ars investments 
under the ars loan program  ubs may demand full or partial payment of the ars loan  at its sole option and without cause  at any time 
in november  we accepted the ars rights offer 
in january  we were approved for the ars loan in the amount of million and drew down the entire preapproved amount 
in addition  in february  we borrowed an additional million under the ars loan  bringing the total amount outstanding under the ars loan to million  following ubs decision to increase our availability under the ars loan 
all cash received under the ars loan was invested in money market accounts 
we elected to measure the ars put under the fair value option of asc to mitigate the volatility in reported earnings due to the linkage of certain of our ars and the ars put 
the fair value of the ars put was also determined by a discounted cash flow valuation model effectively using a liquidity discount of approximately seven percent and an interest rate of approximately five percent  which took into consideration the brokerage firm s weighted average cost of capital 
based on our discounted cash flow valuation  we recorded a realized loss of million in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of our ars and the ars put are based in part on management s estimates and assumptions 
in the event of actual market exchanges  if any  these assumptions may prove materially different from those assumed in our valuation models and amounts may be materially different than our estimates 
for example  a reduction of the expected term to redemption by two years for our ars portfolio yielded in our models a net increase in valuation of our ars of million and an increase in expected term to redemption by two years for our ars portfolio yielded in our model a decrease in valuation of our ars of million 
other factors that may impact the valuation of our ars and the ars put include changes to the credit quality of the underlying assets  discount rates  counterparty risk and the condition of the overall credit market 

table of contents convertible notes 
upon conversion of the convertible notes at each monthly conversion date  the indenture and trust agreement permit the release of the principal and interest represented by such convertible notes to us 
as no convertible notes were converted into shares of our common stock as of december   no amounts were released to us in following the january and february conversion dates  an aggregate of million was released to us in accordance with the indenture and trust agreement  and any subsequent conversions will enhance our liquidity position 
capital resources we have consumed substantial amounts of capital since our inception 
our current cash and cash equivalent balances are our principal sources of liquidity 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of december  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating requirements through at least december  although we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements through at least december   including all of our planned research and development activities  we anticipate that we may require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations and intended research and development activities 
other significant cash and contractual obligations the following summarizes our scheduled long term contractual obligations that may affect our future liquidity as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license obligations convertible notes due escrow agreement total under the license agreements for our product candidates  we may be required to make future payments based upon the occurrence of certain milestones related to clinical development  regulatory or commercial events 
we will also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products  if any are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities for commercial sale 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot determine when  or if  the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur at present 
these are recorded at fair value which is less than face value due to a lack of marketability discount employed in the binomial option pricing model we used to value these contractual obligations 
we also enter into agreements with third parties to conduct our clinical trials  manufacture our product candidates  perform data collection and analysis and other services in connection with our product development programs 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our product development programs 
therefore  we are unable at this time to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income 
our investment securities are trading securities and consist of ars  which are debt instruments with long term maturities in which the interest rates reset in short intervals through dutch auctions by matching buyers and sellers 
all of our ars had aaa ratings at the time of purchase and principally represent interests in government guaranteed student loans  insurance notes and portfolios of securities primarily commercial paper 
none of the underlying collateral for our ars consisted of subprime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
at december   million of our ars consisted primarily of government guaranteed student loan securities and million of our ars consisted of private placement securities 
the continued negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented most investors  including ourselves  from liquidating certain holdings of ars because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for the securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of the dutch auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to the maximum interest rate applicable to the specific securities being auctioned as per the official statement issued at the initial bond sale 
when auctions for these securities fail  as they did in  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or repurchased  sold through a secondary market or mature 
for the year ended december   we liquidated million of ars  which we reinvested in cash equivalents 
in the fourth quarter of  we received and accepted the ars rights offer from ubs 
pursuant to the ars rights offer  we received the ars put 
in january  we were approved by ubs for the ars loan in the amount of million and drew down the entire preapproved amount 
in addition  in february  we borrowed an additional million under the ars loan  bringing the total amount outstanding under the ars loan to million  following ubs decision to increase our availability under the ars loan 
under the ars loan program  ubs may demand full or partial payment of the ars loan  at its sole option and without cause  at any time 
all cash received under the ubs loan was invested in money market accounts 
at december   our outstanding ars loan balance was million 
because the interest that we pay on the ars loan will not exceed the interest that we receive on the ars pledged as security for the ars loan and which are held in the collateral account  we do not believe that this arrangement subjects us to additional interest rate risk
