we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of our three most recent fiscal years and our financial condition at december  except for historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a one stop provider of time critical and technologically complex printed circuit boards pcbs and backplane assemblies  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we serve high end commercial and aerospace defense markets including the networking communications infrastructure  high end computing  defense  and industrial medical markets which are characterized by high levels of complexity and moderate production volumes 
our customers include both original equipment manufacturers oems  electronic manufacturing services ems providers  and aerospace defense companies 
our time to market and high technology focused manufacturing services enable our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
on november   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a purchase agreement with meadville  an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands  and mtg  a company incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of meadville  pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of its pcb subsidiaries 
the pcb subsidiaries  together with their subsidiaries  engage in the business of manufacturing and distributing printed circuit boards  including circuit design  quick turn around services  and drilling and routing services 
following the closing of the proposed pcb combination  the pcb subsidiaries will become our wholly owned subsidiaries 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed at least two orders in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers and as of december  we had approximately customers 
sales to our largest customers accounted for and of our net sales in and  respectively 
we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
sales attributable to our five largest oem customers accounted for approximately and of our net sales in and  respectively 
the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated 
year ended december  end markets aerospace defense networking communications computing storage peripherals medical industrial instrumentation other total sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
for pcbs we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among 
table of contents our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
quick turn orders decreased from approximately of pcb revenue in to approximately of pcb revenue in due to higher demand for our standard lead time and high technology production services 
we also deliver a large percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be canceled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is canceled once it has entered production 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we record an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products as well as stock based compensation expense 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume  and yield 
we do not participate in any significant long term contracts with suppliers  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff  stock based compensation expense as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense  stock based compensation expense  bad debt expense  and acquisition related expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include asset valuation related to bad debts  inventory obsolescence  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  realizability of deferred income tax assets  and determining self insured reserves  asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
inventories in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
provision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  changes due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
we maintain specific finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements with those customers 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles  and goodwill 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our acquisitions of other businesses 
we have two reporting units  pcb manufacturing and backplane assembly  which are also our operating segments 
during the fourth quarter of each year  we perform our annual impairment assessment of goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows and market approach analyses as considered necessary and considered factors such as a weakening economy  reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with a decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period  as indicators for potential goodwill impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we also assess other long lived assets  specifically definite lived intangibles and property  plant and equipment  for potential impairment given similar impairment indicators 
when indicators of impairment exist related to our long lived tangible assets and definite lived assets  we use an estimate of the undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether the carrying amount of the assets are recoverable 
measurement of the amount of impairment  if any  is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuations techniques  including market and income approaches as considered necessary 

table of contents if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our goodwill and other long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
at december  and  we had net deferred income tax assets of million and million  respectively  and no valuation allowance 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
in addition  we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
self insurance we are self insured for group health insurance and worker s compensation benefits provided to our employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against annual claims at the individual and aggregate level 
the insurance carrier adjudicates and processes employee claims and is paid a fee for these services 
we reimburse our insurance carriers for paid claims subject to variable monthly limitations 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not reported at the end of each reporting period and use our judgment using our historical claim data and information and analysis provided by actuarial and claim advisors  our insurance carriers and brokers on an annual basis to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to an individual insured stop loss coverage that ranges from  to  per individual 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities we establish liabilities for the costs of asset retirement obligations when a legal or contractual obligation exists to dispose of or restore an asset upon its retirement and the timing and cost of such work can be reasonably estimated 
the company capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently is adjusted for accretion expense and changes in the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows 
in addition  we accrue an estimate of the costs of site closure environmental investigations and environmental remediation for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated it is probable that cleanup costs are or will be required and may be reasonably estimated 
in making these estimates  we consider information that is currently available  existing technology  enacted laws and regulations  and our estimates of the timing of the required remedial actions  and we discount these estimates at 
we also are required to estimate the amount of any probable recoveries  including insurance recoveries 
we recorded a net adjustment to our estimate for asset retirement obligations in the amount of million during the year ended december  related to changes in the estimated timing and amount of cash flows to restore our leased hayward and los angeles  california manufacturing facilities to shell condition  the full settlement of obligations related to one of our santa clara  california production facility leases  and the partial settlement of obligations related to our hayward  california facility lease 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship of various items to net sales in our consolidated statement of operations year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of definite lived intangibles restructuring charges impairment of goodwill and long lived assets metal reclamation total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense interest income other  net total other expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss we have two reportable segments pcb manufacturing and backplane assembly 
these reportable segments are managed separately because they distribute and manufacture distinct products with different production processes 
pcb manufacturing fabricates printed circuit boards 
backplane assembly is a contract manufacturing business that specializes in assembling backplanes into sub assemblies and other complete electronic devices 
pcb manufacturing customers are either ems companies or oem companies  while backplane assembly customers are usually oems 
our backplane assembly segment includes our hayward  california and shanghai  china plants and our ireland sales support infrastructure 
our pcb manufacturing segment is comprised of seven domestic pcb fabrication plants  including a facility that provides follow on value added services primarily for one of the pcb manufacturing plants 
the following table compares net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net sales pcb manufacturing backplane assembly total sales inter company sales total net sales 
table of contents net sales net sales decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to reduced demand at most of our production facilities resulting from a downturn in the global economy and due to the shutdown of our redmond  washington production facility at the end of march and our los angeles  california facility at the end of november these manufacturing facilities were closed as part of our strategy to concentrate our production at fewer facilities during a period of industry wide reduced demand 
the million revenue decline in our pcb manufacturing segment reflects the closure of our redmond  washington and los angeles  california facilities  partially offset by increased pricing  and compounded by lower demand  mainly in our pcb manufacturing commercial end markets 
pcb volume declined approximately due to reduced demand while prices rose approximately due to a shift in production mix toward more high technology production 
our quick turn production  which we measure as orders placed and shipped within days  decreased from approximately of pcb sales for the year ended december  to approximately of pcb sales for the year ended december  the increasingly complex nature of our quick turn work requires more time to manufacture  thereby extending some of these orders beyond the day delivery window 
the million decline in revenue from our backplane assembly segment was due to reduced volume at our hayward  california production facility in conjunction with the pending closure announced on september  this manufacturing facility is being closed due to a steady decline in volume over several years 
net sales increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this revenue increase is substantially due to increased demand from aerospace defense customers and higher pricing from the pcb manufacturing segment  while backplane assembly segment sales remained relatively consistent with this revenue increase was achieved in spite of the closure of our dallas  oregon facility in april the dallas  oregon facility contributed approximately million of revenue to the pcb manufacturing segment during excluding revenue derived from our dallas  oregon facility  revenue from the pcb manufacturing segment in improved by million from due to increased net sales at our other pcb manufacturing facilities 
pcb sales volume  measured by panels shipped  decreased approximately for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended prices rose approximately due to a shift in production mix toward more high technology production 
our quick turn production  which we measure as orders placed and shipped within days  decreased from of pcb revenue for the year ended december  to of pcb revenue for the year ended december  cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due primarily to the decline in pcb volume discussed above 
the decrease in cost of goods sold was mostly driven by lower labor  direct material costs and supplies associated with lower production volume 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to reduced absorption of fixed costs on lower volume and inventory write off costs related to the closure of our redmond  washington and los angeles  california facility and the pending closure of our hayward  california facility 
cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold increased mainly due to increased sales but was also impacted by increased labor and overhead costs 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from for the year ended december   primarily due to a shift in production mix toward more high technology production and higher pricing 
gross profit as a result of the foregoing  gross profit decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in 
table of contents our gross margin was due primarily to lower fixed cost absorption and inventory write off costs related to the closure of our redmond  washington  and los angeles  california facilities and the pending closure of our hayward  california facility 
while there continues to be a shift in production mix towards more high technology production and higher pricing in  reduced volume across our remaining manufacturing facilities more than offset the benefit of higher pricing and contributed to a lower gross margin 
gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  with gross margin increasing from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the change in our gross margin for was primarily due to a shift in production mix toward more high technology production and higher pricing 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in selling and marketing expense was primarily a result of lower selling labor and commission expenses due to lower net sales and reduced costs as a result of the closure of our redmond  washington facility 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended was primarily due to increased labor expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were consistent at for the years ended december  and general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expense for the year ended december  primarily relates to million in acquisition transaction costs  partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expenses resulted primarily from higher incentive bonus expense and stock based compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock option awards  partially offset by lower accounting and consulting expenses 
restructuring charges restructuring charges recorded for the year ended december  of million are related to separation and contract termination costs 
the separation costs in the amount of million are associated with the lay off of approximately employees  of which employees are associated with the closure of the redmond  washington and hayward and los angeles  california production facilities  and employees are related to various other us facilities during the contract termination costs of million are related to building operating leases associated with the closure of our los angeles  california manufacturing facility 
additionally  we expect to incur contract termination costs ranging from million to million related to building operating leases associated with the pending closure of our hayward  california manufacturing facility in the first quarter of impairment of goodwill and long lived assets impairment of long lived assets for the year ended december  in the amount of million was related to the closure of the redmond  washington and los angeles  california production facilities  and the pending closure of our hayward  california facility  and consists of machinery and equipment 
additionally  during the year ended december  we reduced the value of the redmond  washington and dallas  oregon 
table of contents buildings  which are classified as assets held for sale  by million to record the estimated fair value less costs to sell given current market conditions 
we do not expect to incur any additional significant impairment charges related to these closures 
for the year ended december  we recorded an impairment of long lived assets  including assets held for sale  of million related to our dallas  oregon  redmond  washington  and hayward  california production facilities 
our dallas  oregon facility  which is held for sale  was reduced to million in consideration of real estate market conditions  which represented its then current estimate of fair value less costs to sell 
additionally  we determined that certain long lived assets  consisting of machinery and equipment were impaired due to slower growth and lower future production expectations for hayward  california and the january  announcement of our plans to close the redmond  washington production facility 
the redmond  washington and los angeles  california production facilities are part of the pcb manufacturing operating segment  while the hayward  california facility is part of the backplane assembly operating segment 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million 
as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing  and giving consideration to factors such as a weakening economy  reduced expectation for future cash flows coupled with the decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period as indicators for potential goodwill impairment  we determined that the carrying value of our pcb manufacturing segment s goodwill exceeded its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
metal reclamation during  we recognized million of income related to a pricing reconciliation of metal reclamation activity attributable to a single vendor 
as a result of the pricing reconciliation  we discovered that the vendor had inaccurately compensated us for gold reclamations over the last several years 
while pricing reconciliations of this nature occur periodically  we do not expect to recognize a similar amount in future periods 
other income expense other expense  net decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the overall net decrease consists of a million increase in interest expense  and a million decrease in interest income  offset by a million decrease in other  net 
interest income declined due to lower interest rates  partially offset by higher cash balances 
in connection with the full repayment of our credit facility in  we realized a loss on the settlement of a derivative of million  which was recognized as other  net 
during the years ended december  and  we also recognized as other  net a million unrealized gain and a million unrealized loss  respectively  on a money market fund that suspended redemption and is being liquidated 
other expense decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the net decrease consists of a million decrease in interest expense  offset by a million increase in other  net 
interest expense of million for includes interest costs and the amortization of related debt issuance costs and was accounted for under the new authoritative guidance for convertible debt instruments included in asc subtopic  debt with conversion and other options 
interest costs and amortization of debt issuance costs decreased by million and million  respectively  as compared to  resulting from a combination of overall lower outstanding debt balances under our credit agreement with ubs securities in and a higher level of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs in as a result of high levels of debt repayment during that period 
this decrease was offset by the increase in other  net expense of million primarily related to the realized loss on the settlement of a derivative of million during the quarter ended june  associated with the repayment in full of the credit agreement  the million estimated unrealized loss on a money market fund that suspended redemptions and is being liquidated and other of million 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million from a million tax benefit for the year ended december  to a million tax provision for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was in and for the increase in the provision and the effective tax rate from is primarily due to an increase in pretax income 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  utilization of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
additionally  as of december   we had net deferred income tax assets of approximately million 
based on our forecast for future taxable earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the deferred income tax asset in future periods 
the provision for income taxes decreased million from a million tax provision for the year ended december  to a million tax benefit for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was in and for the decrease in the provision is due to the decrease in pretax income 
the increase in our effective tax rate is due to the addition of state tax credits and the decrease in production activities deductions 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and the issuance of convertible notes 
our principal uses of cash have been to meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures  and fund working capital requirements 
we anticipate that servicing debt  funding working capital requirements  financing capital expenditures  and acquisitions will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million  including restricted cash  compared to million as of december  this increase in working capital is primarily attributable to the growth in cash balances resulting from earnings generated in the period 
our capital expenditure plan is expected to total approximately million and will fund capital equipment purchases to expand our technological capabilities throughout our facilities and replace aging equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in our operating cash flow of million reflects net income of million  million of an impairment of long lived assets  million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by an increase in net deferred income tax assets of million  an unrealized gain of million on short term investments and million other 
the decrease in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended december   was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories due to manufacturing facility closures  improved collection of accounts receivable and better inventory management 
our operating cash flow of million reflects a net loss of million  million of an impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  and million other  offset by an increase in net deferred income tax assets of million and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in  million of cash was placed into restricted accounts for the acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  made net purchases of approximately million of property  plant  and equipment and a licensing agreement and received million in proceeds from the redemption of short term investments 
in  we made net purchases of approximately million of property  plant  and equipment  redesignated million from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and received million in proceeds from the redemption of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in and cash used of million in our financing net cash proceeds primarily reflect cash proceeds from the exercises of employee stock options 
our financing net cash proceeds primarily reflect cash proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes of million  proceeds from warrants of million and exercises of 
table of contents employee stock options of million  partially offset by debt repayment of million  payment for the convertible note hedge of million and debt issuance costs of million 
our financing net cash used reflects repayments of million of debt  partially offset by proceeds of million from employee stock option exercises and million from other factors 
in may  we issued our convertible notes in a public offering with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning november  the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally to our future unsecured senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness 
we received proceeds of million after the deduction of offering expenses of million 
these offering expenses are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes 
at any time prior to november   holders may convert their convertible notes into cash and  if applicable  into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment  under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter beginning after june  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day of such preceding calendar quarter  during the five business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that consecutive trading day period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on such day  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the prospectus supplement related to the convertible notes  which can be found on the sec s website at www 
sec 
gov 
as of december   none of the conversion criteria had been met 
on or after november  until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
upon conversion  for each  principal amount of notes  we will pay cash for the lesser of the conversion value or  and shares of our common stock  if any  based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the trading day observation period 
additionally  in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the prospectus supplement  or other conversion rate adjustments such as share splits or combinations  other distributions of shares  cash or other assets to stockholders  including self tender transactions other conversion rate adjustments  the conversion rate may be modified to adjust the number of shares per  principal amount of the notes 
the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion  including the effect of a fundamental change and subject to other conversion rate adjustments  would be approximately million shares 
we are not permitted to redeem the notes at any time prior to maturity 
in the event of a fundamental change or certain default events  as defined in the prospectus supplement  holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant transaction call spread transaction  with respect to our common stock 
the convertible note hedge  which cost an aggregate million and was recorded  net of tax  as a reduction of additional paid in capital  consists of our option to purchase up to million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
this option expires on may  and can only be executed upon the conversion of the convertible notes 
additionally  we sold warrants for the option to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants expire on august  the proceeds from the sale of warrants of million was recorded as an addition to additional paid in capital 
the call spread transaction has no effect on the terms of the convertible notes and reduces potential dilution by effectively increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes to per share of our common stock 

table of contents as of december   we had two outstanding standby letters of credit a million standby letter of credit expiring february  related to the lease of one of our production facilities and a million standby letter of credit expiring december  associated with our workers compensation insurance program 
during  we announced our plan to close our redmond  washington and hayward and los angeles  california facilities and lay off approximately employees at these sites 
in addition  we laid off about employees at various other us facilities during we recorded million in separation costs related to these restructurings for the year ended december  as of december   million of accrued separation costs remained for approximately employees yet to be separated 
we expect the remaining employees to be separated and a significant amount of the remaining accrued restructuring costs to be paid by the first quarter of additionally  we incurred million in contract termination costs related to building operating leases associated with the closure of our los angeles  california manufacturing facility for the year ended december  we expect to incur contract termination costs ranging from million to million related to building operating leases associated with the closure of our hayward  california manufacturing facility in the first quarter of we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation at various production sites 
we currently estimate that we will incur total remediation costs of million over the next to months related to three connecticut production sites and our former washington production site 
for our connecticut production sites  we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters for two of the sites and have investigated a third site 
we currently estimate that we will incur remediation costs of million to million 
in addition  we have obligations to the connecticut dep to make certain environmental asset improvements to one remaining waste water treatment system in one connecticut plant
