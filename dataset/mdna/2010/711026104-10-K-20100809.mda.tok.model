critical accounting policies and significant estimates our critical accounting policies and significant estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition and allowance for returns revenue is recognized when products are shipped  the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the allowances for returns as of may  and were approximately  and   respectively 
these allowances are recorded at the time of revenue recognition  if the right of return exists  and are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable 
this allowance is estimated by management based on our historical rate of returns 
we recognize shipping and handling revenues as part of revenue  and shipping and handling expenses as part of cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations 
subscription based revenue on our digital products is recognized prorata over the life of the agreement 
deferred prepublication costs deferred prepublication costs are recorded at their original cost and amortized over a three or five year period  based on the estimated lives of the related publications 
the net carrying value of the deferred prepublication costs is periodically reviewed and compared to an estimate of future net undiscounted cash flows 
the valuation allowances as of may  and were approximately  and  respectively  and are believed to be adequate for any exposure to loss 
if future net undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to realize the net carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge will be recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit to our customers is determined on a customer by customer basis 
trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for the doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts after reviewing individual customer accounts as well as considering both historical and expected credit loss experience 
trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of may  and were  and  respectively  and are believed to be adequate for any exposure to loss 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory we continuously monitor our inventory on hand for salability 
this monitoring includes review of historical sales experience  projected sales activity by title  and any planned changes to a title that are known by us 
any slow moving or non salable inventory identified is reserved or written down at that time 
the reserves of approximately  and  at may  and  respectively  are believed to be adequate to cover inventory loss exposure 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on the weight of available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of may  and  a valuation allowance has been provided in the amount of  related to the tax benefit of our available federal and state net operating losses nols 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future 
we perform a comprehensive tax review quarterly and if future levels of taxable income are not sufficient or fail to materialize in the near term  management will adjust the valuation allowance accordingly

distribution revenue  which accounts for approximately of the total revenue within this group  was down and revenue from our proprietary products decreased by on a year over year basis

literacy this product group  which was launched in the fourth fiscal quarter of last year  generated million of revenue for the twelve months ended may  compared to million in prior year

cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal was million of revenue compared to million of revenue in the prior year 
cost of revenue consists of two components direct costs and prepublication cost amortization 
direct costs consist of product cost  which includes paper  printing  binding  and prepress costs for proprietary products and product purchases for nonproprietary products  royalties  and warehousing and shipping costs for all products 
direct costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal were  a decrease from in the prior year 
the percentage decrease is primarily due to revenue mix  as college preparation revenue decreased from of total revenue in fiscal to in fiscal college preparation direct costs are substantially higher than the direct cost of testing  assessment and instruction  as the majority of college preparation revenue consists of nonproprietary products 
prepublication costs include one time expenses associated with developing and producing new or revised proprietary products 
it includes all editorial expenses  writing  page design and makeup  art and other permissions  prepress  and any other costs incurred up to the print bind stage of the books 
these prepublication costs also include expenses incurred for other forms of product development 
prepublication costs are capitalized and expensed on a straight line basis over a three or five year period  based upon the product 
we believe our amortization policy is in line with industry practice

as a percentage of revenue  the expense increased from in the prior year to 
general and administrative expenses for the year were million  a year over year decrease of as we continue to control expenses 
interest expense interest expense for the year was  a decrease of  from the prior year

included in interest expense are non cash income and expenses of  and  as of may  and  respectively  related to the change in the market value of the term loan interest swap agreement 
income tax expense for the year ended may   the effective tax rate was compared to in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared to million in the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily provided by our profitability before depreciation and amortization as well as decreases in inventory  deferred taxes and prepaid expenses  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and deferred revenue  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of expenditures for prepublication costs  was million for fiscal  consistent with the prior year 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million in the prior year  consisting primarily of net repayments under our bank agreement for both the line of credit and the term loan 
we have a million credit agreement with sovereign bank 
amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the revolving line of credit provides for advances up to million and expires in march the interest rate on the revolving line of credit ranges from libor plus to libor plus  or prime to prime plus  with the exact interest rate based on the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
at may   million was outstanding under this facility  and million was available for borrowing 
the term loan was originally for million and matures in december the term loan provides for equal quarterly payments of principal and interest  which began on march  the term loan bears interest at the same rate as the revolving line of credit for million of the million outstanding at may  in may  we entered into a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on the balance of the term loan for three years at a rate of plus an interest spread of to based upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
this swap agreement expired on may  on june   we entered into a new swap agreement for million  expiring in february  fixing our interest rate at plus an interest spread of to based upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
after february  the interest rate reverts to a variable rate 
at may   million was outstanding under this agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  calculated on a consolidated basis for the company and its subsidiary  which  among other things  impose a maximum ratio of total funded debt to ebitda and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these financial covenants restrict the payment of dividends on the company s common stock 
we were in compliance with each of these covenants at may  and we believe that our cash and borrowing availability under our lines of credit  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our normal cash needs in we intend to continue investing in prepublication costs for our proprietary products at our current spending level 
product development product development expenditures in fiscal and were million 
we continue to actively develop new and revised products 
we expect the current level of spending to continue in the future 
product development expenditures in consisted primarily of both print and digital products within the testing  assessment  and instruction product group  as we continued to introduce new and revised products within our existing states 
the state test preparation market is changing with the adoption of the ccss 
however  the current high stake tests will continue to be administered until and there will continue to be a demand for higher academic performance from students 
our product development plan will reflect the market need to continue to support the state specific needs as it reflects the test in place today as well as the potential future needs as a result of the adoption and implementation of the ccss 
we also intend to expand our offering of web based digital products 
presently  we publish test preparation and assessment products for various grades in eleven states 
we will continue to produce proprietary college preparation supplements and ancillary materials 
these products will not compete with products we distribute under our existing publisher agreements and will be crafted as supplements to help teachers and students with their college preparation studies 
we do not have plans in the upcoming year to develop new products for our literacy product line  as we intend to grow this product group by offering additional products from the existing publishers with whom we currently have distribution agreements 
our strategic growth plan calls for an emphasis on the internal development of products within the test preparation  assessment and instruction product lines 
under favorable circumstances  we would consider an acquisition to supplement our growth plan 
off balance sheet arrangements none seasonality the supplementary school publishing business is seasonal  cycling around the school year that runs from september through may 
typically  the major marketing campaigns  including mailings of new catalogs and focused sales efforts  begin in september when schools reopen 
this is the period when sample books are provided free of charge for review to teachers for their purchase consideration 
general marketing efforts  including additional sales and marketing campaigns  catalog mailings  and complimentary copies  continue throughout the school year 
teachers and districts generally review and consider books throughout the school year  make their decisions in the winter and spring  and place their purchase requests at that time 
each of our product lines has its own seasonality
