overview genuine parts company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts  industrial replacement parts  office products and electrical electronic materials 
the company has a long tradition of growth dating back to  the year we were founded in atlanta  georgia 
in  business was conducted throughout the united states  puerto rico  canada and mexico from approximately  locations 
we recorded consolidated net sales of billion for the year ended december   a decrease of compared to billion in consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million  down from million in the effects of the economic slowdown  which we began to experience in the final quarter of  adversely impacted the results in all four of our business segments throughout our businesses were impacted by the effects of reduced consumer spending  lower levels of industrial production and higher unemployment  which we discuss further below 
our revenue decrease of follows a and increase in revenues in and  respectively 
our decrease in net income follows a decrease in and a increase in in each of the three years preceding  the company had experienced double digit earnings growth 
throughout these periods  the company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings  including the introduction of new and expanded product lines  geographic expansion including acquisitions  sales to new markets  enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives 
the prevailing economic conditions of the last two years have offset these initiatives  as reflected in our earnings for and the following discussion addresses the major categories on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the company s cash balance of million was up million from million at december  
table of contents this improvement is due mainly to the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable in relative to in addition  we were less active in our share repurchase program during when compared to accounts receivable decreased by approximately  inventory was down by approximately and accounts payable increased million or from the prior year  due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program 
total debt outstanding at december  was unchanged from million at december  results of operations our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands except per share data net sales gross profit net income diluted earnings per share net sales consolidated net sales for the year ended december  totaled billion  a decrease from each of our four businesses experienced sales decreases  with the industrial and electrical business segments showing the most significant declines  as the manufacturing sector of the economy was severely impacted by the weak economic conditions of the last months 
fortunately  the general weakness in demand resulting from lower consumer spending and industrial production and higher unemployment seemed to stabilize over the last half of the year 
among the four quarters in  the fourth quarter was the strongest period for sales in each business segment 
cumulatively  prices in were down approximately in the automotive segment  approximately flat in the industrial segment and up approximately in the office segment and in the electrical segment 
consolidated sales for the year ended december  totaled billion  a increase from in  the industrial and electrical business segments showed the strongest sales growth among our operations  while the automotive and office segments continued to experience sluggish growth 
for the year  automotive reported a slight sales increase  while office reported a decrease in revenues 
for  prices were up approximately in the automotive segment  in the industrial and electrical segments and in the office segment 
these price increases reflect the highest inflationary period for the company in many years 
automotive group net sales for the automotive group automotive were billion in  a decrease of from sales were impacted by the soft economy  which has reduced the overall level of consumer spending and  specifically  the demand for automotive maintenance and supply items 
the first half of the year proved to be the most challenging  with automotive sales down and in the first and second quarters  respectively 
sales were down in the third quarter followed by a increase in the fourth quarter 
other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include acquisitions  which had an approximately positive effect on sales  and the negative effect of currency  which negatively impacted sales by approximately 
automotive sales were billion in  essentially flat compared to our rate of growth decreased during each quarter of the year  from to to in the first  second and third quarters of  respectively 
this downward trend was partly due to the impact of the decrease in miles driven caused by high gas prices over most of the year 
demand weakened further in the fourth quarter of  as evidenced by the decrease in consumer spending  resulting in a sales decrease from the final quarter of this is consistent with historical patterns during a softening economy  when consumers defer or forego discretionary spending on automotive maintenance and supply items 
other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include acquisitions  which had a slightly positive effect on sales 

table of contents industrial group net sales for motion industries  our industrial group industrial  were billion in  a decrease of compared to through the first three quarters of the year  sales were especially weak for this group due to the effects of very low manufacturing activity  as evidenced by the reported levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization  and its negative impact on demand for industrial products 
this weakness was widespread  as we experienced sales declines in nearly all of our major customer categories 
the industrial indices we follow seemed to show some early signs of stabilization in the third quarter and we observed a slight strengthening in these indicators as we entered the fourth quarter 
industrial sales were down in the fourth quarter  which marks a significant improvement from the declines of the first three quarters of the year 
in  sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions  which accounted for approximately of industrial s sales growth for the year 
net sales were billion in  an increase of compared to through the first three quarters of the year  sales held strong and were relatively consistent from quarter to quarter  increasing in the first quarter and in the second and third quarters 
the fourth quarter proved to be more difficult for this business  due to the deteriorating economic environment  including worsening manufacturing production trends  and sales for the period were even with the fourth quarter of in  sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions  which accounted for nearly of industrial s sales for the year 
office group net sales for sp richards  our office products group office  were billion in  down compared to the prior year 
represents the third consecutive year of decreased revenues for office and reflects the negative impact of higher white collar and service unemployment on office products consumption  a trend that began in during the year  sales improved sequentially  with decreases of   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
for the year  sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in  which contributed nearly to sales in office 
the increase in net sales due to acquisitions  as well as our sales initiatives  was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the office products industry 
net sales for were billion  down compared to this decline was indicative of the industry wide slowdown in office products consumption 
during the year  sales were down in the first quarter and even with the prior year periods in the second and third quarters 
demand in the fourth quarter worsened  consistent with the significant increase in unemployment for the period  and sales were down from the fourth quarter 
for the year  sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions  which contributed nearly to sales in office 
electrical group net sales for eis  our electrical and electronic group electrical  decreased to million in  down from electrical sales declined by in the first quarter  in the second quarter and in the third quarter 
for the fourth quarter  sales were down 
manufacturing contraction  as measured by the institute for supply management s purchasing managers index  was evident through june and then began to stabilize and improve over the last half of the year 
this factor  which we deem as positive for  helps explain the quarterly sales trends at electrical in acquisitions had less than a positive impact on electrical sales in net sales increased by to million in compared to electrical sales were strong through the first nine months of the year  increasing in the first quarter  in the second quarter and in the third quarter 
the deteriorating economy had a significant impact on this business in the fourth quarter and sales decreased from the same period in acquisitions during the year had a positive impact on electrical sales in and  combined with electrical s sales initiatives  partially offset the weakening conditions in the marketplace in the last quarter of the year 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of goods sold from to is consistent with the sales decrease 
cost of goods sold 
table of contents represented of net sales in and of net sales in and the relatively constant rate over these three periods reflects how our ongoing gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies  promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs were generally offset by increasing competitive pricing pressures in the markets we serve 
in  our office and electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases 
industrial was flat and automotive pricing was down for the year 
in and  all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases 
in any year where we experience price increases  we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 
operating expenses selling  administrative and other expenses sg a decreased by million to billion in  representing of net sales and up from of net sales in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from the prior year due primarily to the loss of expense leverage associated with the sales decrease for the year 
during  management continued its implementation of extensive cost control initiatives to offset this loss of leverage 
these measures emphasize continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our utilization of people and systems and  for the year  we eliminated approximately million in operating costs 
examples of such savings include costs associated with personnel  freight  fleet and logistics  among others 
the company reduced its workforce by in before consideration of acquisitions and this follows a reduction in employees in severance and other termination benefits associated with these employee reductions were insignificant 
our management teams remain focused on the ongoing assessment of the appropriate cost structure in our businesses and the need for additional cost reductions  while maintaining our high standards for excellent customer service 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million  up slightly from the provision for doubtful accounts was million in  up from a million bad debt expense in our bad debt expense reflects an increase in uncollectible accounts receivables in and is likely directly correlated to the ongoing effects of the difficult economic climate  which has pressured certain of our customers 
we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december  in  sg a was billion  or of net sales  which was an increase from when sg a as a percentage of net sales was 
this increase was mainly due to the loss of leverage on the lower level of sales growth in relative to the prior year  which offset the benefits of our ongoing cost control initiatives 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million  relatively consistent with the provision for doubtful accounts was million in  up from a million bad debt expense in total share based compensation expense for the years ended december   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding share based compensation 
non operating expenses and income non operating expenses consist primarily of interest 
interest expense was million in  a decrease from million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease is the result of an improved interest rate on certain long term debt  effective november in other  interest income net of noncontrolling interests increased in from due primarily to the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in in  interest income net of noncontrolling interests decreased from due to the effects of lower interest rates 
income before income taxes income before income taxes was million in  a decrease of from million in as a percentage of net sales  income before income taxes was in  reflecting a decrease from in in  income before income taxes of million was down from million in and as a percentage of net sales was  a decrease from in 
table of contents automotive group automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales  which we refer to as operating margin  increased to in from in the improvement in operating margin for is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented during and automotive s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to improve its operating margin in the years ahead 
automotive operating margins decreased to in from in the decline in operating margin for is attributed to automotive s lower sales volume for the year  partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction measures 
industrial group industrial operating margins decreased to in from in and the decrease in operating margins in was primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of these conditions led to lower levels of sales volume in  which severely impacted our expense leverage  despite our cost reduction efforts 
in addition  the decrease in inventory purchases in  a direct result of lower sales  significantly reduced the level of volume incentives earned during the year 
these factors more than offset our sales initiatives and cost reduction efforts 
we will continue to focus on these areas  however  to show progress in the years ahead 
office group operating margins in office were in  down from in and in the prevailing weakness in the office products industry that began in continued to pressure the operating margins at office in the decrease in revenues for these three periods has negatively impacted our expense leverage 
our sales strategy remains to capture additional market share  despite the industry slowdown 
electrical group operating margins in electrical decreased to in from in in  the electrical operating margins had increased to from in and marked the fifth consecutive year of operating margin improvement for electrical 
in  the decrease in operating margins was primarily a function of weak market conditions 
this factor outweighed the benefits of electrical s sales initiatives and expense savings 
ongoing efforts in these areas  as well as a more stable manufacturing sector  will serve to improve electrical s future operating margins 
income taxes the effective income tax rate decreased to in from in the decrease from the rate is mainly due to tax free income in associated with a company retirement plan 
the tax rate in had increased from in the increase from the prior year rate was mainly due to a non deductible expense associated with a company retirement plan

refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inventories provisions for slow moving and obsolescence the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs 
while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future  its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed  a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and  therefore  the need to revise estimates for bad debts 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded provisions for bad debts of million  million  and million  respectively 
consideration received from vendors the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances 
generally  the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon fulfilling its obligations related to cooperative advertising programs 
the company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year and  in the case of advertising allowances  upon completion of the company s obligations related thereto 
while management believes the company will continue to receive such amounts in 
table of contents and beyond  there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in the future 
impairment of property  plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually  the company evaluates property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
the company s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance  among other factors 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
employee benefit plans the company s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company s pension plan assets 
the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company s management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada and fiduciary standards 
the long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk  protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan s actuarially assumed long term rate of return 
the company s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark s p index  russell mid cap index  russell index  msci eafe index  and barcap us govt credit 
we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense 
we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases  mortality rates  retirement patterns and turnover rates 
based on the investment policy for the pension plan  as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company s asset allocations and future expectations  the company s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring pension expense or income is for the plan 
the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company s benefit obligations  using capital market data and historical relationships 
the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date 
we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate 
based upon this cash flow matching analysis  we selected a weighted average discount rate for the us plans of at december  net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreasing trend in pension cost over these periods was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurment which is discussed below  and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 
in april  the company recorded a million non cash curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization  which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the us defined benefit pension plan 
in july  the company announced changes to the us postretirement benefit plan 
effective january   future retirees will no longer receive employer provided medical benefits and current pre retirees will no longer receive employer provided post benefits beyond an access only arrangement

as a result  the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 
the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements 
specifically  the company makes certain estimates in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts  inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned 
bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales  and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels 
inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual october book to physical inventory adjustment 
the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates for interim reporting typically results in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end 
the effect of these adjustments in and was not significant

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices  the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
foreign currency the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes 
the company s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar  which is the functional currency of our canadian operations 
foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian dollar and  to a lesser extent  the mexican peso  negatively impacted our results for the year ended december  during and  it was estimated that a shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately million and million  respectively
