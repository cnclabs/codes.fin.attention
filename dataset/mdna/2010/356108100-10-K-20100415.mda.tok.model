the company also encourages its store managers to create in store advertising displays and signage in order to increase customer traffic and impulse purchases 
store operations all fred s stores are open six days a week monday through saturday  and most stores are open seven days a week excluding the pharmacy 
store hours are generally from am to am  however  certain stores are only open until pm each fred s store is managed by a full time store manager and those stores with a pharmacy employ a full time pharmacist 
the company s district managers and regional vice presidents supervise the management and operation of fred s stores 
fred s operates pharmacies as of january   which offer brand name and generic pharmaceuticals and are staffed by licensed pharmacists and are managed by healthcare managers 
the addition of acquired pharmacies in the company s stores has resulted in increased store sales and sales per selling square foot 
management believes that the pharmacy department  in addition to the other merchandise departments  increases customer traffic and repeat visits and is an integral part of the store s operation 
the company has an incentive compensation plan for store managers  pharmacists and district managers based on meeting or exceeding targeted profit percentage contributions 
various factors included in determining profit percentage contribution are gross profits and controllable expenses at the store level 
these factors of operating performance are reviewed regularly by executive management to pinpoint developments in key performance areas 
management believes that this incentive compensation plan  together with the company s store management training program  are instrumental in maximizing store performance 
the company s training program covers all aspects of the company s operation from product knowledge to handling customers with courtesy 
inventory control the company s centralized management information system maintains a daily stock keeping unit sku level inventory and current and historical sales information for each store and the distribution centers

this system is integrated with the company s centralized management information system to provide up to date perpetual records as well as facilitating merchandise allocation and distribution decisions 
the company uses cycle counts throughout the year to ensure accuracy within the warehouse management system 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in that the company s sales volume is heavier around the first of the calendar month 
many of the customers who shop at fred s stores rely on government aid  social security  and other means that are typically paid at the first of the month 
these governmental payment cycles coupled with the distribution of our newspaper advertising circular are major factors in concentrating sales earlier in the calendar month

competition the discount retail merchandise business is highly competitive

our competitors range from smaller  growing companies to considerably larger retail businesses that have greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we do 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with them in the future 
see statement regarding forward looking disclosures and item a risk factors

these regulations are issued by an administrative body in each state  typically a pharmacy board  which is empowered to impose sanctions for non compliance 
additionally  the drug enforcement agency dea requires that controlled substances be monitored and controlled at all times 
as a provider of medicare prescription drug plan benefits  we are subject to various federal regulations promulgated by the center for medicare and medicaid services under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in the future we may also be subject to changes to various state and federal insurance laws and regulations in connection with the company s pharmacy operations 
healthcare initiatives legislative and regulatory initiatives pertaining to such healthcare related issues as reimbursement policies  payment practices  therapeutic substitution programs  and other healthcare cost containment issues are frequently introduced at both the state and federal level 
the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act of may affect our pharmacy business  but it is too early to judge what that impact might be

risk factors investors are encouraged to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to fred s securities 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management  or that management currently deems immaterial  may also impair the company s business operations 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if one or more of these events do occur  business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in that instance  the trading price of fred s securities could decline  and investors might lose all or part of their investment 
our business is somewhat seasonal 
we typically realize a significant portion of our net sales during the christmas selling season in the fourth quarter 
our inventories and short term borrowings  if required  increase in anticipation of this holiday season 
a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms 
if for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations  our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns  especially in seasonal merchandise 
we operate in a competitive industry 
we are in a highly competitive sector of the discount retail industry 
this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of reduced profitability because of lower prices  and lower margins  required to maintain our competitive position 
we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers  including department stores  variety stores  dollar stores  discount clothing stores  drug stores  grocery stores  outlet stores  convenience stores  warehouse stores and other stores  some of whom may have greater resources than we do 
this competitive environment subjects us to various risks  including the ability to continue to provide competitively priced merchandise to our customers that will allow us to maintain profitability and continue store growth 
some of our competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities  advertising programs  and pricing discounts and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not respond effectively to these efforts 
changes in third party reimbursements  including government programs  could adversely affect our business 
a significant portion of our sales are funded by federal and state governments and private insurance plans 
for the years ended january  and january   pharmaceutical sales were and of total sales  respectively 
the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward cost containment with governments and private insurance plans seeking to impose lower reimbursements and utilization restrictions 
payments made under such programs may not remain at levels comparable to the present levels or be sufficient to cover our cost 
private insurance plans may base their reimbursement rates on the government rates 
accordingly  reimbursements may be limited or reduced  thereby adversely affecting our revenues and cash flows 
additionally  and in light of a worsening economy and recent healthcare legislation  government or private insurance plans may adjust scheduled reimbursement payments to us in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition 
changes in consumer demand and product mix and changes in overall economic conditions could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for product mix 
a general slowdown in the united states economy  rising personal debt levels  rising foreclosure rates  rising fuel prices  or changes in government aid  social security  and other means that many of our customers rely upon may adversely affect the spending of our consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  changes in the types of products available for sale and the selection of products by our customers affect sales  product mix and margins 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  inflation  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect our business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
we might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies  which would adversely affect our sales and gross profit performance 
in addition  increases in fuel and energy costs would increase our transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect our financial statements as a whole 
natural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions could affect our business 
unusually adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or similar disruptions  could significantly reduce our net sales 
in addition  these disruptions could also adversely affect our supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from suppliers 
a number of our stores are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes and tornadoes 
merchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence on imports could adversely affect our business 
we have maintained good relations with our vendors and believe that we are generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
we purchase a significant portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers  principally in the far east 
as a result  political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations relating to duties on imports could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs 
also  our cost of goods is affected by the fluctuation of local currencies against the dollar in countries where these goods are produced 
accordingly  changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and  if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers  decrease our gross margins and ultimately our earnings 
we purchase a significant amount of goods from procter and gamble and several large import vendors and any disruption in that supply and or pricing of such merchandise could negatively impact our operations and results 
delays and costs of operating new stores and distribution facilities could have an adverse impact on our business 
we maintain two distribution facilities in our geographic territory  and plan on constructing new facilities as needed to support our growth 
one of our key business strategies is to expand our base of retail stores 
we plan on expanding and refreshing our network of stores through new store openings and remodeling existing stores each year 
delays in opening  refreshing or remodeling stores or delays in opening distribution facilities to service those new stores could adversely affect our future operations by slowing growth  which may in turn reduce revenue and margin growth 
adverse changes in the cost to operate distribution facilities and stores  such as changes in labor  utilities  fuel and transportation  and other operating costs  could have an adverse impact on us 
operational difficulties could disrupt our business 
our stores are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel 
our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores  including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage  may negatively impact our sales and or margin 
in addition  we rely upon our distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely and cost effective manner  any disruption  unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively impact store operations 
our operation depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and upgrade these systems as needed 
we rely on telecommunications carriers to gather and disseminate our operations information 
the disruption or failure of these systems or carriers could negatively impact our operations 
use of a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our ability to negotiate satisfactory terms could adversely affect our business 
we have a long term supply contract from a single supplier  amerisourcebergen  for our pharmaceutical operations 
any significant disruption in our relationship with this supplier  deterioration in their financial condition  changes in terms  or an industry wide change in wholesale business practices  including those of our supplier  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
higher than expected costs and not achieving our targeted results associated with the implementation of new programs  systems and technology could adversely affect our business 
we are undertaking a variety of operating initiatives as well as store upgrades and infrastructure initiatives 
the failure to properly execute any of these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
changes in state or federal legislation or regulations  including the effects of legislation and regulations on wage levels and entitlement programs  trade restrictions  tariffs  quotas and freight rates could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated changes in federal or state wage requirements or other changes in workplace regulation could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial targets 
changes in trade restrictions  new tariffs and quotas  and higher shipping costs for goods could also adversely impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results 
we depend on the success of our new store opening program for a portion of our growth 
our growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores 
unavailability of store locations that we deem attractive  delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores  difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations and lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas all may negatively impact our new store growth  the costs associated with new stores and or the profitability of new stores 
our ability to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms could affect costs of operations or slow store expansions 
changes in our ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in health care and other insurance costs could adversely affect our business 
our growth could be adversely impacted by our inability to attract and retain employees at the store operations level  in distribution facilities  and at the corporate level  including our senior management team 
adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees 
adverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims could affect our business 
we are a party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims  including those described elsewhere in this annual report 
operating results could be adversely impacted if legal proceedings and claims against us are made  requiring the payment of cash in connection with those proceedings or changes to the operation of the business 
our ability to achieve the results of our strategic plan initiatives could adversely affect our business 
as part of our continuing operations  we perform research and analysis to discover potential underperforming stores 
we use such research and analysis to identify potential store closures 
the estimated costs and charges associated with these initiatives may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors  including the timing of execution  the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties  or unexpected costs  any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan 
increases in our insurance related costs could significantly affect our business 
the costs of many types of insurance and self insurance  especially workers compensation  employee health care and others  have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs  legislative changes  economic conditions  terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers 
our pharmacy departments are also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  including with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings  and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe  government approved and non counterfeit products 
we also sell a variety of products that we purchase from a large number of suppliers  including some who operate in foreign countries  which could become subject to contamination  product tampering  mislabeling or other damage 
while we maintain reasonable quality assurance practices  no program can provide complete assurance that a product liability issue will not arise 
should a product liability issue arise  the coverage limits under our insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us against future claims 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue could have an adverse affect on our business 
if our insurance related costs increase significantly  or we are unable to renew our insurance policies or protect against all the business risks facing us  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
adverse impacts associated with the current economic and financial crisis could affect our business 
the lingering economic downturn could have an adverse impact of our business and profitability 
many consumers have fallen prey to the current crisis either as a result of job losses  foreclosures  or their inability to obtain short term financing  all of which could negatively affect their ability to shop in our stores and buy our products 
additionally  decreased consumer demand resulting from a pronounced negative consumer sentiment and an increasing personal savings rate could also negatively affect our sales and profits 
also  our ability to obtain financing  should the need arise outside of our current contractual credit facility  could be at risk due to restrictive lending practices in the wake of the liquidity crisis in the united states financial system

item properties as of january   the geographical distribution of the company s retail store locations in states was as follows state number of stores georgia mississippi alabama tennessee arkansas south carolina louisiana north carolina texas florida kentucky illinois missouri indiana oklahoma the company owns the real estate and the buildings for locations  of which are closed and locations which are subject to ground leases

store locations range in size from  square feet to  square feet 
three hundred and sixty eight of the locations are in strip centers or adjacent to a downtown shopping district  with the remainder being freestanding 
it is anticipated that existing buildings and buildings to be developed by others will be available for lease to satisfy the company s expansion program in the near term 
it is management s intention to enter into leases of relatively moderate length with renewal options  rather than entering into long term leases 
the company will thus have maximum relocation flexibility in the future  since continued availability of existing buildings is anticipated in the company s market areas

executive summary recognizing our pharmacy department as a key factor differentiating us from other small box discount retailers  we have accelerated our growth strategy in this area and are aggressively pursuing opportunities to acquire independent pharmacies within our targeted markets 
our emphasis will continue to be on acquisitions and buying prescription files  but cold starts will be employed where it makes sense to do so 
as we have mentioned previously  we began offering our prescription plus generic program in all pharmacies in the chain 
we piloted this program on a limited basis last year and found it to be a traffic driver  and thus rolled it out to all pharmacies in the first quarter 
we are pleased with this deployment and its effect on our prescription count 
our own brand initiative continues to be a key strategy for the company in terms of building customer loyalty and increasing gross margin 
we have reached an own brand penetration rate of approximately of total sales  and that number will continue to grow in the future as new own brand products are introduced 
our commitment to quality in our own brand products is resonating with our customers and they continue to make the switch to our fred s brand 
we are continuing to add new products to our own brand line on an ongoing basis  with new items in paper and chemicals  food and hardware introduced during expense reduction and containment continues to be a key focus of the company  especially in light of current economic conditions 
we are aggressively pursuing cost reductions in all functional areas and are also continuously reviewing internal processes to find efficiencies and or redundancies and drive unnecessary costs and expenses out of the business 
these efforts are being coordinated at the executive level and close attention is being paid not to sacrifice service to our customers 
these efforts resulted in a basis point reduction in expenses as a percentage of sales or million in compared to the same period last year 
improving inventory productivity has been a key focus throughout initiatives set in motion in  such as reducing the store fixture profile to remove inventory displayed above eye level  improvement in seasonal buying to reduce pack away inventory and continuous improvement in the line review process  have resulted in a reduction in total company inventory from the same period last year 
this reduction in inventory was accomplished without jeopardizing our in stock positions or the merchandise selection available to our customers 
during  we continued refining our real estate site selection and store layout programs 
we continue to improve the interior layout of our stores so that our customers experience more open customer spaces  more logical product flow and a more consistent and meaningful price message  all of which are intended to provide a more pleasurable shopping trip 
we also continue to hone our real estate strategy so that the proper site is selected to support our targeted demographics  thus driving traffic and sales 
many of these efforts culminated in the third quarter with the grand opening of our pilot store of the future 
throughout  we have continued with capital improvements in infrastructure  including new stores as well as existing store expansion and remodels  distribution center upgrades and further development of our information technology capabilities 
technology upgrades have been made in the areas of direct store delivery systems  in store systems  and pharmacy systems 
during  the company will continue to implement its strategic plan to improve profitability and operating margin 
a significant number of stores will be refreshed in to highlight our core program  which spotlights differentiated  traffic driving departments within our store 
additionally  a number of these departments have higher than average margin and increased focus and sales will affect our overall product mix and margin 
also  a number of our stores will be remodeled to reflect our new pilot store format  which delivers higher sales per square foot and higher contribution margin per square foot 
while our private label or fred s brand products will continue to be a focus in  we will implement several national brands in our stores 
national brands that resonate with our customers will be implemented to provide our customers with a more complete shopping trip 
throughout the year  we will be evaluating which name brands are the most popular with our customers and will be adding those that complement our current product mix 
key factors that will be critical to the company s future success include managing the strategy for opening new stores and pharmacies  including the ability to open and operate efficiently  maintaining high standards of customer service  maximizing efficiencies in the supply chain  controlling working capital needs through improved inventory turnover  managing the effects of inflation or deflation  controlling product mix  increasing operating margin through improved gross margin and leveraging operating costs  and generating adequate cash flow to fund the company s future needs 
other factors that will affect company performance in include the continuing management of the impacts of the changing regulatory environment in which our pharmacy department operates  especially in regards to the health care legislation recently passed by the united states congress and related regulations currently being developed 
additionally  we believe that the prolonged recession and elevated unemployment rate continue to place tremendous economic pressure on the consumer 
however  we also continue to believe that our affordable pricing and value proposition make us an attractive destination to wary consumers 
critical accounting policies the preparation of fred s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
the company markets goods and services through company owned stores and franchised stores as of january  net sales include sales of merchandise from company owned stores  net of returns and exclusive of sales taxes 
sales to franchised stores are recorded when the merchandise is shipped from the company s warehouse 
revenues resulting from layaway sales are recorded upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
the company also sells gift cards for which the revenue is recognized at time of redemption 
the company records a gift card liability on the date the gift card is issued to the customer 
revenue is recognized and the gift card liability is reduced as the customer redeems the gift card 
the company will recognize aged liabilities as revenue when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote gift card breakage 
the company has not recognized any revenue from gift card breakage since the inception of the program in may and does not expect to record any gift card breakage revenue until there is more certainty regarding our ability to retain such amounts in light of current consumer protection and state escheatment laws 
in addition  the company charges the franchised stores a fee based on a percentage of their purchases from the company 
these fees represent a reimbursement for use of the fred s name and other administrative costs incurred on behalf of the franchised stores and are therefore netted against selling  general and administrative expenses 
total franchise income for   and was   and  respectively 
inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail first in  first out fifo method for goods in our stores and the cost first in  first out fifo method for goods in our distribution centers 
the retail inventory method is a reverse mark up  averaging method which has been widely used in the retail industry for many years 
this method calculates a cost to retail ratio that is applied to the retail value of inventory to determine the cost value of inventory and the resulting cost of goods sold and gross margin 
the assumption that the retail inventory method provides for valuation at lower of cost or market and the inherent uncertainties therein are discussed in the following paragraphs 
in order to assure valuation at the lower of cost or market  the retail value of our inventory is adjusted on a consistent basis to reflect current market conditions 
these adjustments include increases to the retail value of inventory for initial markups to set the selling price of goods or additional markups to adjust pricing for inflation and decreases to the retail value of inventory for markdowns associated with promotional  seasonal or other declines in the market value 
because these adjustments are made on a consistent basis and are based on current prevailing market conditions  they approximate the carrying value of the inventory at net realizable value market value 
therefore  after applying the cost to retail ratio  the cost value of our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market as is prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
because the approximation of net realizable value market value under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups  markdowns and inventory losses shrink  there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross margin 
in order to mitigate that uncertainty  the company has a formal review by product class which considers such variables as current market trends  seasonality  weather patterns and age of merchandise to ensure that markdowns are taken currently  or a markdown reserve is established to cover future anticipated markdowns 
this review also considers current pricing trends and inflation to ensure that markups are taken if necessary 
the estimation of inventory losses shrink is a significant element in approximating the carrying value of inventory at net realizable value  and as such the following paragraph describes our estimation method as well as the steps we take to mitigate the risk of this estimate in the determination of the cost value of inventory 
the company calculates inventory losses shrink based on actual inventory losses occurring as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between yearly physical inventory counts 
the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical counts is calculated on a store specific basis and is based on history  as well as performance on the most recent physical count 
it is calculated by multiplying each store s shrink rate  which is based on the previously mentioned factors  by the interim period s sales for each store 
additionally  the overall estimate for shrink is adjusted at the corporate level to a three year historical average to ensure that the overall shrink estimate is the most accurate approximation of shrink based on the company s overall history of shrink 
the three year historical estimate is calculated by dividing the book to physical inventory adjustments for the trailing months by the related sales for the same period 
in order to reduce the uncertainty inherent in the shrink calculation  the company first performs the calculation at the lowest practical level by store using the most current performance indicators 
this ensures a more reliable number  as opposed to using a higher level aggregation or percentage method 
the second portion of the calculation ensures that the extreme negative or positive performance of any particular store or group of stores does not skew the overall estimation of shrink 
this portion of the calculation removes additional uncertainty by eliminating short term peaks and valleys that could otherwise cause the underlying carrying cost of inventory to fluctuate unnecessarily 
the company has not experienced any significant change in shrink as a percentage of sales from year to year during the subject reporting periods 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy inventories  which were approximately million  and million at january  and january   respectively  cost was determined using the retail lifo last in  first out method in which inventory cost is maintained using the retail inventory method  then adjusted by application of the producer price index published by the us department of labor for the cumulative annual periods 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by approximately million at january  and million at january  the lifo reserve increased by approximately million and million during and  respectively 
the company has historically included an estimate of inbound freight and certain general and administrative costs in merchandise inventory as prescribed by gaap 
these costs include activities surrounding the procurement and storage of merchandise inventory such as merchandise planning and buying  warehousing  accounting  information technology and human resources  as well as inbound freight 
the total amount of procurement and storage costs and inbound freight included in merchandise inventory at january  is million  with the corresponding amount of million at january  impairment 
the company s policy is to review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with fasb asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all stores open at least years or remodeled more than years 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease or years for owned stores 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to management s judgment and are difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets or other reasonable estimates of fair market value based upon management s judgment 
exit and disposal activities 
during fiscal  the company closed underperforming stores 
during fiscal  the company closed underperforming stores and underperforming pharmacies 
the closures took place during the first three quarters of pursuant to our restructuring plan announced february  and were the result of an in depth study conducted by the company of its operations over the previous quarters 
the study revealed that fred s has a strong and healthy store base  and that by closing these underperforming stores the company would improve its cash flow and operating margin  both of which are core goals of the company s overall strategic plan 
as a result of the successful execution of this plan  the company is stronger and is in a better position to respond to fluctuations in the economy and to take advantage of opportunities to further improve our business 
during fiscal  the company closed underperforming stores  which is consistent with our anticipated amount of annual store closures 
inventory impairment during fiscal  we recorded a below cost inventory adjustment of approximately million to reduce the value of inventory to lower of cost or market in stores that were planned for closure as part of the company s strategic plan to improve profitability and operating margin 
the adjustment was recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended february  in fiscal  we recorded an additional below cost inventory adjustment of million to reduce the value of inventory to lower of cost or market associated with stores closed in the third quarter and utilized the entire million impairment 
lease termination for store closures where a lease obligation still exists  we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the cease use date when the store is closed in accordance with fasb asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
liabilities are established at the cease use date for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs  as prescribed by fasb asc key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements  estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations  and estimation of other related exit costs 
if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease income differ from our estimates  the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts 
these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 
during fiscal  we closed under performing stores and recorded lease contract termination costs of million in rent expense in conjunction with those closings  of which million was utilized during fiscal  leaving 
million in the reserve at the beginning of fiscal year during fiscal  we closed under performing stores and recorded lease contract termination costs of million  of which million was charged to rent expense and 
million reduced the liability for deferred rent 
we utilized million during the period  leaving million in the reserve at january  during fiscal  we utilized million  leaving million in the reserve at january  the following table illustrates the exit and disposal activity related to the store closures discussed in the previous paragraphs in millions beginning balance january  additions fy utilized fy ending balance january  lease contract termination liability fixed asset impairment during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million in selling  general and administrative expense for the impairment of fixed assets and leasehold improvements associated with the planned closure of stores in during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an additional charge of 
million associated with store closures that occurred in the third quarter 
impairment of million for the planned store closures was recorded in fiscal property and equipment and intangibles 
property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease including the upcoming renewal option  if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement  whichever is lesser 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal as a component of operating income 
the following average estimated useful lives are generally applied estimated useful lives building and building improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements years or term of lease  if shorter automobiles and vehicles years airplane years assets under capital lease are depreciated in accordance with the company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of renewal options  if shorter  and the charge to earnings is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are included in other noncurrent assets  primarily represent customer lists associated with acquired pharmacies and are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
vendor rebates and allowances 
the company receives rebates for a variety of merchandising activities  such as volume commitment rebates  relief for temporary and permanent price reductions  cooperative advertising programs  and for the introduction of new products in our stores 
in accordance with fasb asc customer payments and incentives  rebates received from a vendor are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold or a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses if the reimbursement represents a specific incremental and identifiable cost 
should the allowance received exceed the incremental cost  then the excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
any excess amounts for the periods reported are immaterial 
any rebates received subsequent to merchandise being sold are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold when received 
as of january   the company had approximately vendors who participate in vendor rebate programs and the terms of the agreements with those vendors vary in length from short term arrangements to be completed within a month to longer term arrangements that could last up to three years 
in accordance with fasb asc advertising costs  the company charges advertising  including production costs  to selling  general and administrative expense on the first day of the advertising period 
gross advertising expenses for  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
gross advertising expenses were reduced by vendor cooperative advertising allowances of million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
it would be the company s intention to incur a similar amount of advertising expense as in prior years and in support of our stores even if we did not receive support from our vendors in the form of cooperative adverting programs 
insurance reserves 
the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on claims known at the time of determination of the reserve and estimates for future payments against incurred losses and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
estimates for future claims costs include uncertainty because of the variability of the factors involved  such as the type of injury or claim  required services by the providers  healing time  age of claimant  case management costs  location of the claimant  and governmental regulations 
these uncertainties or a deviation in future claims trends from recent historical patterns could result in the company recording additional expenses or expense reductions that might be material to the company s results of operations 
the company carries additional coverage for excessive or catastrophic claims with stop loss limits of  for property and general liability and  for employee medical 
the company s insurance reserve was million and million on january  and january   respectively 
changes in the reserve over that time period were attributable to additional reserve requirements of million netted with reserve utilization of million 
income taxes 
the company reports income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
under fasb asc  the asset and liability method is used for computing future income tax consequences of events  which have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during the year in the company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities see note income taxes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fasb asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
that is codified in fasb asc we adopted fasb asc as of february   the first day of fiscal this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb asc and prescribes a minimum recognition threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination that a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
under fasb asc  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fasb asc provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition see note income taxes 
fasb asc further requires that interest and penalties required to be paid by the tax law on the underpayment of taxes should be accrued on the difference between the amount claimed or expected to be claimed on the tax return and the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements 
the company includes potential interest and penalties recognized in accordance with fasb asc in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense 
as of january   accrued interest and penalties related to our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million  respectively  and are both recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within other non current liabilities 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation expense recognized post adoption includes compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the fasb asc  and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc results for prior periods have not been restated 
effective january   the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in fasb asc for calculating the income tax effects of stock based compensation 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the income tax effects of stock based compensation  and for determining the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the income tax effects of stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of fasb asc fasb asc also requires the benefits of income tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
the impact of adopting fasb asc on future results will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 
stock based compensation expense  post adoption of fasb asc  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the company s historical forfeiture experience and will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
equity incentive plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding equity incentive plans 
results of operations the following table provides a comparison of fred s financial results for the past three years 
in this table  categories of income and expense are expressed as a percentage of sales 
for the year ended january  january  february  net sales cost of good sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before taxes income taxes net income cost of goods sold includes the cost of product sold  along with all costs associated with inbound freight 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with purchasing  receiving  handling  securing and storing product 
these costs are associated with products that have been sold and no longer remain in ending inventory 
results include certain charges for the non routine closing of stores in and the stores closed in see item  exit and disposal activities section 
comparable sales 
our policy regarding the calculation of comparable store sales represents the increase or decrease in net sales for stores that have been opened after the end of the th month following the store s grand opening month  including stores that have been remodeled or relocated during the reporting period 
the majority of our remodels and relocations do not include expansion 
the purpose of the remodel or the relocation is to change the store s layout  refresh the store with new fixtures  interiors or signage or to locate the store in a more desirable area 
this type of change to the store does not necessarily change the product mix or product departments  therefore  on a comparable store sales basis  the store is the same before and after the remodel or relocation 
in relation to remodels and relocations  expansions have been much more infrequent and consequently  any increase in the selling square footage is immaterial to the overall calculation of comparable store sales 
additionally  we do not exclude newly added hardline  softline or pharmacy departments from our comparable store sales calculation because we believe that all departments within a fred s store create a synergy supporting our overall goals for managing the store  servicing our customer and promoting traffic and sales growth 
therefore  the introduction of all new departments is included in same store sales in the year in which the department is introduced 
likewise  our same store sales calculation is not adjusted for the removal of a department from a location 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales net sales for decreased to  million from  million in  a year over year decrease of million or 
excluding sales from stores closed in million  total sales were up million or over the prior year 
on a comparable store basis  sales for increased 
million compared with a million increase in the same period last year 
the company s front store non pharmacy sales decreased over front store sales 
excluding the front store sales from stores closed in million  sales increased 
over prior year 
we experienced sales increases in categories such as tobacco  food and small appliances partially offset by decreases in home furnishings  health and beauty aids and housewares 
the company s pharmacy sales were of total sales in compared to of total sales in the prior year and continue to rank as the largest sales category within the company 
the total sales in this department  including the company s mail order operation which we closed during the first quarter of  increased over  with third party prescription sales representing approximately of total pharmacy sales  the same as in the prior year 
the company s pharmacy department continues to benefit from an ongoing program of purchasing prescription files from independent pharmacies as well as the addition of pharmacy departments in existing store locations 
sales to fred s franchised locations during decreased to million of sales from million of sales in the decrease in year over year franchise sales continues to be impacted by the ongoing economic challenges affecting our customers disposable income 
the company does not intend to expand its franchise network 
the sales mix for the period  unadjusted for deferred layaway sales  was pharmaceuticals  household goods  food and tobacco  paper and cleaning supplies  apparel and linens  health and beauty aids  and franchise

gross profit gross profit for the year decreased to million in from million in  a year over year decline of million or 
gross margin  measured as a percentage of sales  declined to in from in gross margin was unfavorably impacted by continued competitive pressures  higher promotional markdowns  and an unfavorable shift in the product mix toward lower margin basic and consumable products 
gross profit was also favorably impacted  primarily in the third and fourth quarter  by purchase price variances related to those and previous quarters 
these purchase price variances resulted from reduced product costs obtained from vendors 
the impact on prior quarters was immaterial 
this unfavorability was partially offset by an increase in vendor dollar consideration and higher general merchandise department markup and improved shrink experience 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  decreased to million in of sales from million in of sales 
this basis point expense leverage resulted primarily from the effect of our store closures in fiscal million  a reduction in professional fees primarily due to the legal costs related to the settlement of the atchinson and ziegler cases recorded in fiscal million see item legal proceedings from our k filed april  
in addition  we continued to manage costs in our stores by reducing labor expense million and lowering utilities expense million with the installation of energy management systems 
this favorability was partially offset by deleveraging in our pharmacy labor and depreciation expense related to new pharmacy openings during the fiscal year 
operating income operating income increased to million in of sales from million in of sales due primarily to a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as the company did not incur expenses related to store closures in and did not experience the one time legal costs as in  referenced in the selling  general and administrative expenses section above 
this favorability was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of million  a year over year decline of  as described in the gross profit section above 
interest expense  net net interest expense for totaled

the company s estimates of income taxes and the significant items resulting in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and reflect the company s assessment of future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in the company s financial statements or tax returns for each taxing authority in which it operates 
actual income taxes to be paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the outcome of audits completed by federal and state taxing authorities 
the reserves are determined based upon the company s judgment of the probable outcome of the tax contingencies and are adjusted  from time to time  based upon changing facts and circumstances 
state net operating loss carry forwards are available to reduce state income taxes in future years 
these carry forwards total approximately million for state income tax purposes and expire at various times during through if certain substantial changes in the company s ownership should occur  there would be an annual limitation on the amount of carry forwards that can be utilized 
we have provided a reserve for the portion believed to be more likely than not to expire unused 
we expect our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal to from fiscal due mainly to the settlement of the internal revenue service examination million during net income net income increased to million

per diluted share in the increase in net income is primarily attributable to the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of resulting from the effect of our store closures in fiscal million and the legal costs related to the settlement of the atchinson case also in million see item legal proceedings from our k filed april  
this favorability was partially offset by the million reduction in gross profit as described within the caption gross profit above  as well as increased income taxes due to a million increase in pretax income and an increased tax rate resulting from the final settlement of the irs audit 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales net sales increased million in approximately million of the increase was attributable to a net addition of new stores  and a net addition of pharmacies during  together with the sales of store locations and pharmacies that were opened or upgraded during and contributed a full year of sales in comparable store sales  consisting of sales from stores that have been open for more than one year  increased in  which accounted for million in sales 
this increase was partially offset by the closure of stores and pharmacy locations during those stores represent a reduction in year over year sales of million 
the company s front store non pharmacy sales increased approximately over front store sales 
front store sales growth benefited from the above mentioned store additions and improvements  and sales increases in certain categories such as pets  tobacco  paper and chemical  food  prepaid products  beverage and lawn and garden 
fred s pharmacy sales were of total sales in and of total sales in and continue to rank as the largest sales category within the company 
the total sales in this department  including the company s mail order operation  decreased over  with third party prescription sales representing approximately of total pharmacy sales  the same as in the prior year 
the company s pharmacy department continued to benefit from an ongoing program of purchasing prescription files from independent pharmacies and the addition of pharmacy departments in existing store locations  however overall pharmacy department sales declined due to the closing of pharmacies in  the sales mix shift from branded to generic and a significant decline in the company s mail order operation caused by a lack of competitive sourcing for its primary product  contraceptives 
sales to fred s franchised locations increased approximately million in and represented of the company s total sales  compared to of the company s total sales in the increase in sales to franchised locations results primarily from the sales volume increases experienced by the franchise locations during the year 
the company does not intend to expand its franchise network in the future 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in compared to in excluding the costs associated with closing underperforming stores in both years million in and million in  see note exit and disposal activities  gross margin was in compared with in this decline resulted from continued pricing pressures  an unfavorable shift in the product mix toward lower margin  basic and consumable products  and higher inbound freight costs 
these negative factors were partially offset by the favorable margin effect of a positive mix shift in the pharmacy department from branded to generic drugs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in insurance costs of million related to increasing medical costs and higher claims  additional legal costs of million related to the settlement of the ziegler and atchinson cases see item legal proceedings as well as an additional million in impairment charges from lease write offs and liquidation fees for stores closed in these increases were partially offset by decreases in labor costs of million  occupancy costs of million and advertising costs of million all resulting from the store closures completed in the current year 
operating income operating income increased to million in of sales from million in of sales due to increased sales primarily from comparable stores and new stores in and a gross margin increase which was driven by a reduction in year over year costs associated with closing underperforming stores million in versus million in 
these increases were reduced by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses due primarily to higher insurance costs of million related to increasing medical costs and higher claims  additional legal costs of million related to the settlement of the ziegler and atchinson cases see item legal proceedings as well as an additional million in impairment charges from lease write offs and liquidations fees for stores closed in these increases were partially offset by decreases in labor costs of million  occupancy costs of million and advertising costs of million all resulting from the store closures completed in the current year

we expect our effective tax rate to increase in fiscal to from fiscal and fiscal levels due to the expiration of federal credits for jobs in the hurricane impact zone and the mid year end expiration of state tax incentives offered by georgia 
net income net income increased to million 
per diluted share in from million 
per diluted share in the increase in net income is attributable to sales increases of and gross margin increases of driven by a reduction in year over year costs associated with closing underperforming stores million in versus million in 
the gross margin increase was partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative costs of million as described within the caption selling  general and administrative expenses above  as well as increased income taxes of due to a million increase in pretax income and an increased tax rate resulting from less tax credits being available in when compared to liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirements include funding new stores and pharmacies  remodeling existing stores and pharmacies  maintenance of stores and distribution centers  and the ongoing investment in information systems 
fred s primary sources of working capital have traditionally been cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit facility 
the company had working capital of million  million and million at year end  and  respectively 
working capital fluctuates in relation to profitability  seasonal inventory levels  and the level of store openings and closings 
working capital at year end increased by approximately million from the increase was primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents of million due to improved cash management and a million reduction in accrued expenses related to the settlement of two legal cases see item legal proceedings in our k filed april  
the increase described above was offset by a year over year increase in account payable of million  a result of our focus on improving our terms with vendors 
in  the company intends to open approximately stores and pharmacies and close an estimated stores and pharmacies 
during   and  we incurred losses caused by fire  tornado and flood damage  which consisted primarily of losses of inventory and fixed assets 
we reached settlements on some of our insurance claims related to inventory and fixed assets in  and insurance proceeds related to fixed assets are included in cash flows from investing activities and proceeds related to inventory losses and business interruption are included in cash flows from operating activities
