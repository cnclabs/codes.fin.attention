item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook and note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 
uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business 
recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues  profitability and cash flow 
although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands  during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands  which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings 
additionally  retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 
while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities  any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit  which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements  such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments  were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent  they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us 
this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures 
in addition  tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers  contract manufacturers or trade customers which could  in turn  adversely impact our business 
significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 
we face vigorous competition around the world  including from other large  multinational consumer product companies  some of which have greater resources than we do 
we face this competition in several aspects of our business  including  but not limited to  the pricing of products  promotional activities  advertising and new product introductions 
we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such activities or initiatives by competitors or to successfully counteract them  which could harm our business 
in addition  the cost of responding to such activities and initiatives may affect our financial performance in the relevant period 
our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to protect our patent  trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors 
a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large format retailers and discounters 
with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent on key retailers  and some of these retailers  including large format retailers  may have greater bargaining strength than we do 
they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts  allowances or slotting fees  which could lead to reduced sales or profitability 
we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers  such as inventory de stocking  limitations on access to shelf space  delisting of our products  environmental initiatives and other conditions 
in addition  private label products sold by retail trade chains  which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products  are a source of competition for certain of our product lines  including liquid hand soap 

table of contents the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products 
our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions  which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors 
in addition  our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can develop and fund technological innovations  receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection  obtain governmental approvals and registrations of regulated products  comply with us food and drug administration fda and other governmental regulations  and anticipate consumer needs and preferences successfully 
the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in the company not being the first to market  which could compromise our competitive position 
volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 
raw and packaging material commodities such as resins  tallow  corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations 
increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy  transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution 
in addition  our move to global suppliers  for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business  has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers 
for certain materials  new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry  government and colgate standards  which can require additional investment and take some period of time 
while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate  global economic conditions  supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of  or prices for  those raw materials 
damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 
maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products 
accordingly  we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation  such as our ethics and compliance  sustainability  brand protection and product safety  regulatory and quality initiatives 
in particular  adverse publicity about product safety or quality and similar types of concerns  real or imagined  or the allegations of product contamination or tampering  whether or not valid  may result in a product recall or reduced demand for our products 
a significant product recall could tarnish the image of the affected brands and cause consumers to choose other products 

table of contents in addition  from time to time  third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products 
to the extent that third parties sell products that are counterfeit versions of our brands  consumers of our brands could confuse our products with products that they consider inferior  or that pose safety risks  which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business 
similarly  adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns  our environmental impacts  including packaging  energy and water use and waste management  or other sustainability issues  whether or not deserved  could jeopardize our reputation 
damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business  as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 
our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 
the manufacture  packaging  labeling  storage  distribution  advertising and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation in the us and abroad 
this regulation includes  but is not limited to  the following in the us our products and the manufacture of our products are subject to regulation and review and or approval by the food and drug administration fda as well as by the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency epa  our product claims and advertising are regulated by the federal trade commission  the fda and the epa and  in addition  state and local agencies regulate in parallel to the above agencies  we are also subject to similar regulation in the foreign countries in which we manufacture and sell our products  and our selling practices are regulated by competition authorities in the us and abroad 
a finding that we are in violation of  or out of compliance with  applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies  including fines  damages  injunctions or product recalls  or criminal sanctions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even if a claim is unsuccessful  is not merited or is not fully pursued  the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and brand image 
for information regarding our european competition matters  see item  legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacture and sale of the products we currently market 
new or more restrictive regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations  however  could have an adverse impact on our business 
for example  from time to time  various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe  the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of certain ingredients in consumer products  including triclosan 
a finding by a regulatory authority that triclosan  or any other of our ingredients  should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated  could have an adverse impact on our business  as could negative reactions by our consumers  trade customers or non governmental organizations to our use of such ingredients 
currently  colgate uses triclosan in certain of its oral  personal and home care products  including colgate total toothpaste  softsoap brand liquid hand soap  palmolive dish liquid and protex bar soap 
our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 
the company is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale 
we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities  including  but not limited to industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues  environmental events  strikes and other labor disputes  disruptions in logistics  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites  raw material and product quality or safety issues  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control 
while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials  significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and  if not remedied  have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition  if our products  or raw materials contained in our products  are found or perceived to be defective or unsafe  we may need to recall some of our products  our reputation and brand image could be diminished  and we could lose market share or become subject to liability claims  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 
our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees 
if we are unable to attract and retain talented  highly qualified senior management and other key people  our future operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management  including our chief executive officer  our business may be materially adversely affected 
while we follow a disciplined  ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time

managing foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity price fluctuations 
volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques  including working capital management  selling price increases  selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions  issued with standard features  in accordance with the company s treasury and risk management policies 
the company s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives for any purpose as well as derivatives for trading purposes 
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to these market fluctuations is discussed below 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over countries and territories  it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar 
our foreign currency exposures reflect the company s operations in the markets in latin america of net sales  europe south pacific of net sales and asia africa of net sales 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost containment measures  selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements 
see the results of operations section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each segment 
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  other than those operating in highly inflationary environments  are translated into us dollars at year end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity 
income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments  inventories  prepaids  goodwill and property  plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates  while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year end exchange rates 
remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income 
the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts  including forward and swap contracts  local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases  assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed months and the contracts are valued using observable forward rates 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts our foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of at december  and net unrealized losses of at december  changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
at the end of  an unfavorable change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of interest rate risk the company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases  and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 
based on year end variable rate debt levels  a percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense  net by in commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production  such as resins  tallow  corn and soybeans 
the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures  ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts 
futures contracts are used on a limited basis  primarily in the pet nutrition segment  to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 
our open commodity derivative contracts  which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  resulted in net unrealized losses of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at the end of  an unfavorable change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in an unrealized net loss of credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts  however  nonperformance is considered unlikely as it is the company s policy to contract with highly rated diverse counterparties 
recent accounting pronouncements no new accounting pronouncement issued or which became effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management 
the company s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
the company s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports such costs  primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  the company s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales 
if such costs had been included in cost of sales  gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by bps  from to  in and decreased by and bps in and  respectively  with no impact on reported earnings 
the company accounts for inventories using both the first in  first out fifo method approximately of inventories and the last in  first out lifo method approximately of inventories 
there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for  and had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits  stock options  asset impairments  uncertain tax positions  tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies 
in pension accounting  the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate for us defined benefit plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
the discount rate for other us postretirement plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
discount rates used for the us defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the us plans 
for the company s international plans  the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for us plans was as of december   and in determining the long term rate of return  the company considers the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent year  year  year  year and year periods were     and  respectively 
in addition  the current rate of return assumption for the us plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately in fixed income securities which are expected to earn approximately in the long term  in equity securities which are expected to earn approximately in the long term and in real estate and other which are expected to earn approximately in the long term 
a change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income by approximately a third assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase  a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return 
this rate was as of december   and refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s pension and other postretirement plans 
the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate 
the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate 
the assumed rate of increase is for  declining to by and remaining at for the years thereafter 
the effect of a increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as stock options and restricted stock  based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant 
the company uses the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
the weighted average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended december  was 
the black scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options 
these assumptions include expected term of options  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
while these assumptions do not require significant judgment  as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third party sources  changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value 
a one year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 
a one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 
the asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
since the estimated fair value of the company s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value  significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets 
the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards  to net realizable value 
factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction  carryforward periods  income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts legal and other contingency reserves are based on management s assessment of the risk of potential loss  which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors 
such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances  if necessary 
while it is possible that the company s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies  it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  on going results of operations or cash flows 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s contingencies 
the company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms 
while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates  there is a short time frame typically less than days between the shipment of product and cash receipt  thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates
