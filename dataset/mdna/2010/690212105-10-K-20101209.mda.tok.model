table of contents overview we are a leading value added manufacturer of high quality  prepared frozen food products for branded retail  private label  foodservice and airline customers 
our product line includes entr es  plated meals  bulk packed meal components  pastas  soups  sauces  poultry  meat and fish specialties  and organic and vegetarian offerings 
our extensive research and development efforts  combined with our extensive catalogue of recipes and flexible manufacturing capabilities  provide customers with a one stop solution for new product ideas  formulations and product manufacturing  as well as precise replication of existing recipes 
our capabilities allow customers to outsource product development  product manufacturing and packaging  thereby avoiding significant fixed cost and variable investments in reso urces and equipment 
our customers include prominent nationally recognized names such as jenny craig  inc  american airlines  inc  safeway inc  pinnacle foods group llc  and panda restaurant group  inc our goal is to continue as a leading developer and manufacturer of value added food products and provider of custom prepared frozen foods 
we intend to continue to execute our growth and operating strategies  including diversifying and expanding our customer base by focusing on sectors we believe have attractive growth characteristics  such as foodservice and retail  investing in and operating efficient production facilities  providing value added ancillary support services to customers  offering a broad range of products to customers in multiple channels of distribution  and exploring strategic acquisitions and investments 
overall  we have performed well in the midst of a poor economy 
despite decreased net revenues we continued to pay down our previous debt and were also able to refinance with more favorable terms 
we were also able to increase investment spending in our plants  which enabled us to achieve certification under the new global food safety management systems standard fssc this new certification will allow us to better compete for new business opportunities 
sales during the first half of fiscal year reflected  in great part  rebuilding of customer inventories from low late calendar year levels  in anticipation of a rebound in the economy 
as the us economic recovery lagged  most of our customers experienced decreased sales  particularly during our fiscal third quarter of while our foodservice accounts increased during fiscal year  these gains were not enough to offset other account decreases 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we were additionally impacted by the seasonality in our retail category  as retailers typically sell fewer frozen meals during warmer months 
despite all the above  in fiscal year we generated million in net cash from operations  reduced total debt by million and incre ased retained earnings by million 
in addition  we paid off an additional million on our debt subsequent to fiscal year as our top line revenues decreased during fiscal year  our margins  primarily in our third and fourth quarters  were negatively affected by higher overhead costs as a percentage of net revenues on the lower sales volume 
although we expect continued margin pressure  we anticipate margins will improve as sales revenues increase as the economy continues to recover 
we believe we can offset the higher overhead costs through reduced purchase prices of raw materials  production efficiencies and a change in mix of customers between retail  foodservice and airlines 
subsequent to fiscal year  we entered into a five year licensing agreement with boston market corporation bmc for the exclusive right to use bmc s trademarks  trade dress and copyrights in connection with the manufacturing  advertising  promotion  sales and distribution of frozen food and certain shelf stable licensed products 
the agreement commences on july  the agreement also contains options for two sixty month renewal terms 
we will pay bmc an earned royalty computed at four and a half percent of net sales during the initial term with no guaranteed minimum royalties 
we will pay a guaranteed minimum royalty of million and million for the first and second renewal terms  respectively

during the latter part of the third quarter of fiscal year  safeway inc ended its brokerage agreement and took the functi on in house  so the brokerage we pay to safeway inc is now recorded as a reduction of revenue

the standard became effective for the company s fiscal year that began on september  the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued a standard on business combinations that establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  and the goodwill acquired 
the standard also modifies the recognition for preacquisition contingencies  such as environmental or legal issues  restructuring plans and acquired research and development value in purchase accounting 
the standard amends the standard on accounting for income taxes  and requires the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed c apital  depending on the circumstances 
the standard also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the standard became effective for the company s fiscal year that began on september  the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued a standard on the accounting for noncontrolling interests  which clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests 
the standard became effective for the company s fiscal year that began on september  the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform on going credit evaluations of each customer s financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any customer could impact its future ability to satisfy its receivables with us 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  historically have been relatively small  as we generally transact the substantial portion of our busine ss with large  established food or service related businesses 
for fiscal years  and  our write offs  net of recoveries  to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total net revenues during the last two fiscal years was derived from three customers 
panda restaurant group  inc  jenny craig  inc 
and safeway inc  accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our net revenues for fiscal year and approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenues for fiscal year receivables related to panda restaurant group  inc through its distributors  jenny craig  inc  safeway inc 
and pinnacle foods group llc  accounted for approximately   and  respectively of our total accounts receivable balance at september  and approximately   and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at september  
table of contents inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and write it down based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
we write down our inventory for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products and discontinued items and components 
we determine the amount of the write down by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in material increases in the write down of our inventory 
property and equipment 
the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to ten years 
leasehold improvements to our plant no 
in vernon  california are amortized over the lesser of the initial lease term plus one lease extension period  initially totaling years  or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
other leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method 
we assess property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost of materials purchased and labor expended in betterments and major renewals are capitalized 
costs and related accumulated depreciation of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposals are included in operating income 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
at september   we had goodwill of million 
a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a charge to income at that time 
we adopted the provisions of fasb guidance on accounting for uncertainty of income taxes on october  the guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with the standard on accounting for income taxes 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the implementation of the guidance  we recorded no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and the balan ce of unrecognized tax benefits was zero at september  
table of contents we have also adopted the accounting policy that interest and penalties recognized are classified as part of income taxes 
no interest and penalties were recognized in the statement of income for fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk obligations 
we are subject to interest rate risk on variable interest rate obligations 
a hypothetical increase in average market interest rates would increase by approximately  the annual interest expense on our debt outstanding as of september
