each of the three years addressed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is based on weeks 
our next week fiscal year will occur in our comparable store sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year 
a summary of factors important to understanding our results for is provided below and further discussed in the narrative that follows this overview 
total company sales were billion in  down compared to sales in north america decreased for the year and comparable store sales in north american retail decreased 
international division sales decreased in us dollars and in local currencies 
gross margin for improved by basis points from  following a basis point decline in the prior year 
the increase in primarily reflects improved product margins and lower levels of inventory shrink and valuation charges partially offset by the deleveraging of fixed property costs on lower sales levels 
as part of our previously announced strategic reviews  we recorded charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these expenses the charges include primarily charges for lease accruals  severance expenses and asset impairments 
total operating expenses were down billion compared to of this amount  billion relates to the non cash charges for impairment of goodwill and trade names recognized in the remaining change primarily reflects lower payroll and advertising expenses as well as reductions in distribution costs and fixed asset impairments 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash tax expense to establish valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of million per share because of the uncertainty of future realizability of these assets 
diluted loss earnings per share for   and were   and  respectively 
the charges had a per share impact of  and in  and  respectively 
cash flow from operating activities was million in  compared to million in  primarily reflecting the reduction in business performance related to weak economic conditions 
on june   we issued million of redeemable preferred stock and received cash  net of fees paid  of approximately million 
during the second half of  we accrued paid in kind dividends on the redeemable preferred stock totaling approximately million  measured at fair value 

table of contents operating results our overall sales decreased in  and in  and increased in adverse economic conditions throughout our sales territories contributed to the declines for and the sales increase was driven by higher us dollar sales in the international division 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in resulted primarily from improved product margins and lower levels of inventory shrink and valuation charges partially offset by the deleveraging of fixed property costs on lower sales levels 
gross margins in reflect significant deleveraging of fixed property cost on lower sales as well as the impact of a highly promotional environment 
an increase in private brand sales and a shift to core supplies benefited gross margin in total operating expenses as a percentage of sales was in  in and in the  and amounts include charges of million  million and million  respectively 
the amount also includes goodwill and trade name impairment charges of billion and operational asset impairments of million 
after considering these charges  the remaining operating expenses were approximately basis points lower than in and basis points higher than in the and changes reflect the impact of relatively fixed levels of labor costs on a declining sales base 
the change also includes the deleveraging of fixed distribution costs on lower sales while the change reflects increases in legal and professional fees and the impact of no bonus expense in discussion of other income and expense items  including material charges and changes in interest and taxes follows our review of segment results 
north american retail division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit loss of sales sales in our north american retail division decreased in and in during  we closed underperforming stores as part of the strategic review initiated during the fourth quarter of comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased 
comparable store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year decreased for the full year and showed successive declines throughout each quarter of the year 
the sales declines in both and were driven by macroeconomic factors as consumers and small business customers curtailed their spending in response to the global financial crisis that began in while transaction counts were down in  a drop in average order value was the greater contributor to our sales decline 
additionally  our commitment to proactively reduce promotions in select categories resulted in lower sales compared to within each of our three major product categories of supplies  technology and furniture  we experienced sales declines compared to the negative comparable store sales were driven by fewer sales of higher priced  discretionary categories in furniture and technology 
the north american retail division reported operating profit of approximately million in  compared to an operating loss of million in this measure of operating performance is consistent with the internal reporting of results used to manage the business and allocate resources and does not include charges associated with the strategic decisions made as part of the internal review initiated during the fourth quarter of please see charges discussion in the corporate and other section of md a 

table of contents the increase in division operating profit for was driven by lower asset impairments  an improvement in product margins and lower operating expenses 
the improvement in product margins was driven primarily by a more favorable product mix  lower levels of inventory shrinkage and valuation charges as well as lower product costs 
these product margin improvements were partially offset by the deleveraging of fixed property costs on lower sales levels 
during  we recorded fixed asset impairment charges of approximately million 
store impairment charges in totaled million 
additionally  as a result of the fixed asset impairments  we experienced lower levels of depreciation expense 
during  we closed underperforming stores as part of the strategic review initiated during the fourth quarter of contributing to the increase in division operating profit in operating expenses  including distribution costs and payroll and advertising expenses were down in both and in addition to the fixed asset impairment charges  the operating loss in included increased levels of inventory shrink compared to division operating profit in both and was negatively impacted by the unfavorable impact our sales volume decline had on gross margin and operating expenses the flow through impact 
at the end of  we operated  retail stores in the us and canada 
we opened six new stores during and stores during during  we closed stores in north america  of which were part of the strategic review initiated during the fourth quarter of we anticipate opening approximately stores in also  we will continue to review locations as leases become due and will close or relocate stores when appropriate 
north american business solutions division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales sales in our north american business solutions division decreased in and in the sales declines in both and reflect the impact of challenging economic conditions 
the decline was principally driven by a decrease in the number of customer transactions  which resulted in part from aggressive pricing from some of our competitors in our large  national accounts and contraction in our public sector business 
on a product category basis  the division experienced weakness in durables such as furniture  technology and peripherals  as customers delayed their purchases of these products in favor of consumables like paper  ink and toner 
division operating profit totaled million in  compared to million in this measure of operating performance is consistent with the internal reporting of results used to manage the business and allocate resources and does not include charges associated with the strategic decisions made as part of the internal review initiated during the fourth quarter of please see charges discussion in the corporate and other section of md a 
the decrease in division operating profit in was driven by the flow through impact of lower sales levels as well as lower product margins  reflecting a less profitable product mix and cost increases that could not be passed on to our customers 
division operating profit for also reflects increased promotions in our direct business during the first half of the year 
these negative impacts were partially offset by reductions in operating expenses  including a decrease in distribution costs as well as lower payroll and advertising expenses 
the decrease in division operating profit in resulted primarily from the flow through impact of lower sales levels  an increased accrual for bad debts consistent with the economic downturn and higher costs related to advertising and professional fees 

table of contents international division dollars in millions sales change change in local currency sales division operating profit of sales sales in our international division in us dollars decreased in and increased in local currency sales decreased in and in the sales declines in both and resulted from the global economic crisis  which had a negative effect on both business investment and office supply expenditures and resulted in lower sales levels in both our contract and direct businesses 
although we are becoming more effective at retaining our higher value customers  sales in the direct business declined in local currency in because of softness in higher priced items such as furniture and technology 
sales in the contract business declined in local currency as larger businesses have reduced their workforces and their discretionary spending on office supplies 
additionally  the international division s sales were reduced in as a result of our exit from the retail business in japan 
division operating profit totaled million in  compared to million in this measure of operating performance is consistent with the internal reporting of results used to manage the business and allocate resources and does not include charges associated with the strategic decisions made as part of the internal review initiated during the fourth quarter of nor a goodwill impairment charge of million recognized at the corporate level in please see charges discussion in the corporate and other section of md a 
the decreases in division operating profit in and were driven by the flow through impact of lower sales levels 
this negative impact was partially offset by lower operating expenses  including a decrease in distribution costs as well as lower payroll and advertising expenses 
other factors  including a shift to lower margin customers and cost increases that could not be fully passed on to our customers  negatively impacted division operating profit in both and during  we also recorded a non cash gain of approximately million related to the curtailment of a defined benefit pension plan in the uk and non cash impairment charges of approximately million related to our customer list intangible assets 
for us reporting  the international division s sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
the division s reported sales were negatively impacted by approximately million in and positively impacted by million in from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
division operating profit was negatively impacted by million in and positively impacted by million in from changes in foreign exchange rates 
internally  we analyze our international operations in terms of local currency performance to allow focus on operating trends and results 
corporate and other asset impairments  exit costs and other charges during the fourth quarter of  we announced the launch of an internal review of assets and processes with the goal of positioning the company to deal with the degradation in the global economy and to benefit from its eventual improvement 
the results of that internal review led to decisions to close stores  exit certain businesses and write off certain assets that were not seen as providing future benefit 
these decisions resulted in material charges that were recognized during the fourth quarter of and fiscal year additional information about these activities is provided below 

table of contents as of the end of  we have substantially completed all activities falling under our strategic reviews 
although we do not expect to recognize new charges under these programs in future periods  positive and negative adjustments to previously accrued amounts as well as accretion on discounted long term accruals such as lease obligations will continue to impact our results in future periods 
we currently estimate accretion of approximately million for and declining amounts in subsequent periods 
all such amortizations and settlements or adjustments to related accruals will be included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses and recognized at the corporate level  outside of division operating profit 
during  we also recognized material goodwill and trade name impairment charges 
in  we recognized charges associated with the ending stages of a previously disclosed business review 
a summary of the charges and the line item presentation of these amounts in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows 
dollars in millions  except per share amounts cost of goods sold and occupancy costs store and warehouse operating and selling expenses goodwill and trade name impairments other asset impairments general and administrative expenses total pre tax charges income tax effect after tax impact per share impact of the total charges  approximately million either have or are expected to require cash settlement  including longer term lease obligations that will require cash over multi year lease terms  approximately million of charges are non cash items 
the primary components of charges during and include goodwill and trade name impairments we perform our annual review of goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter 
as a result of this review for  we recorded non cash charges of billion to write down goodwill and million related to the impairment of trade names 
as previously disclosed and summarized here  our recoverability assessment of these non amortizing intangible assets considered company specific projections  assumptions about market participant views and the company s overall market capitalization around the testing period 
no impairments were identified in or retail store initiatives as a result of the strategic review  we closed certain stores in north america and exited our retail operations in japan 
additionally  we reduced the planned number of north american retail store openings for in total  we closed stores in north america and stores in japan 
six of the north american locations were closed during the fourth quarter of and the remaining stores were closed during the stores closed under this program were underperforming stores or stores that were no longer a strategic fit for the company 
the charges associated with the initiatives related to our retail stores totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the charges were primarily related to lease accruals  inventory write downs  severance expenses and other facility closure costs 
included in the charges is the impact of a reclassification to the accrued lease liability of previously accrued lease related costs such as tenant improvement allowances and various rent credits associated with facilities closed during the net effect of this reclassification was to lower the lease related charges recognized in by approximately million 
the charges related primarily to asset impairments  inventory write downs and lease accruals 
supply chain initiatives as a result of the strategic review of our supply chain operations  we consolidated certain facilities in north america and europe 
during  we closed five distribution centers and six crossdock facilities in north america and completed the consolidation of our distribution centers in europe 

table of contents charges related to these actions totaled approximately million in and related primarily to lease accruals  inventory write downs  severance expenses and other facility closure costs 
the charges under these initiatives totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of accelerated depreciation  severance related costs and lease accruals 
asset sales and sale leaseback transactions as a result of the strategic review and to enhance liquidity  we entered into multiple sale and sale leaseback transactions 
total proceeds from these transactions were approximately million and are included in the investing section on our consolidated statement of cash flows 
losses on these transactions are included in the charges and totaled approximately million in gains have been deferred and will reduce rent expense over the related leaseback periods 
one transaction was the sale of an asset previously classified as a capital lease 
payments to satisfy the existing capital lease obligation are included in the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
an additional sale leaseback arrangement associated with operating properties included provisions that resulted in the transaction being accounted for as a financing 
accordingly  approximately million has been included in long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at december  headcount reductions and other restructuring activities each of the divisions  as well as corporate eliminated positions in an effort to centralize activities and eliminate geographic redundancies 
total severance and termination benefit costs associated with these actions totaled approximately million and million during and  respectively 
during  we also recorded charges for contract terminations on certain leased assets totaling approximately million and for other restructuring activities totaling approximately million 
additionally  we recognized a non cash loss of approximately million in conjunction with the disposition of other assets during charges for other restructuring activities in totaled approximately million and related primarily to asset write downs and costs associated with the restructuring of our back office operations and call centers in europe 
the charges recognized in totaled million and related primarily to the consolidation of warehouses and distribution centers in north america and europe as well as management restructuring and call center consolidation in europe 
in addition to the charges that relate to the strategic reviews  during  we recognized other material charges because of the downturn in our business 
those charges include material asset impairments relating to stores we continue to operate  charges to impair amortizing customer relationship intangible assets  as well as an increase in our allowance for bad debts related to our private label credit card portfolio and certain other accounts receivable balances to reflect the economic downturn 
as these charges are considered reflective of operating an ongoing business in difficult times  they were included in the division operating results 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses g a decreased from million in to million in the portion of g a expenses considered directly or closely related to division activity is included in the measurement of division operating profit 
the company continues to evaluate g a and other expense allocation across the divisions and may refine methodologies in future periods 
other companies may charge more or less g a expenses and other costs to their segments  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the remainder of the total g a expenses are considered corporate expenses 
a breakdown of g a is provided in the following table dollars in millions division g a corporate g a total g a of sales 
table of contents decreases in division g a in were primarily driven by reductions in payroll related costs and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates offset partially by higher levels of performance based variable pay 
corporate g a includes charges of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
after considering these charges  corporate g a expenses increased by million in and million in the change in primarily reflects increased depreciation expense and higher levels of performance based variable pay 
the increase in depreciation expense resulted primarily from the capital lease associated with our new corporate campus as well as the company s implementation of a new enterprise software system which was placed in service at the beginning of the third quarter of the increases were offset partially by reduction in legal and professional fees as well as lower payroll related costs 
corporate g a for also includes approximately million from the effect of accelerated vesting of certain employee stock grants following approval of the redeemable preferred stock issuance 
change in control features in certain employment contracts could result in additional g a expenses in future periods if covered executives are involuntarily  or in certain cases  voluntarily terminated 
the increase primarily reflects higher performance based variable pay  costs for professional and legal fees and approximately million of severance charges related to a voluntary exit incentive program for certain corporate employees 
gain on sale of building in december  in connection with a decision to move to a new  leased  headquarters facility  we sold our corporate campus and entered into a leaseback agreement pending completion of the new facility 
the sale resulted in a gain of approximately million recognized in and million deferred over the leaseback period 
we recognized approximately million in amortization of the deferred gain on the sale during both and this amortization largely offset the rent expense during the leaseback period 
during  we entered into a longer term lease on our current corporate campus  and we moved into this facility during the fourth quarter of other income and expense dollars in millions interest income interest expense miscellaneous income  net interest expense decreased for compared to  reflecting a reduction in interest expense on borrowings as we did not borrow under our asset based credit facility during the second half of partially offsetting this positive factor was increased interest expense resulting from the amortization of debt issuance costs related to our asset based credit facility and the capital lease associated with our corporate campus 
the decrease in interest income during resulted primarily from lower investment rates 
the increase in interest expense in was driven by additional capital leases and a higher level of short term borrowings throughout the year 
our net miscellaneous income consists of our earnings of joint venture investments  royalty income  gains and losses related to foreign exchange transactions  and realized gains and impairments of other investments 
the majority of miscellaneous income is attributable to equity in earnings from our joint venture in mexico  office depot de mexico 
the decrease in primarily reflects lower joint venture earnings resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this decrease was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency transactions as we recognized lower foreign currency losses in  compared to the decrease in reflects foreign currency losses offset partially by higher joint venture earnings 

table of contents income taxes dollars in millions income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings loss before income taxes 
during  the company recognized income tax expense of million 
the expense primarily reflects valuation allowances recorded in the third quarter totaling million  with million related to domestic deferred tax assets and million related to foreign deferred tax assets 
the establishment of valuation allowances and development of projected annual effective tax rates requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates 
both positive and negative evidence  as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence  is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
an accumulation of recent pre tax losses is considered strong negative evidence in that evaluation 
because of the downturn in our performance during this recessionary period  as well as the significant restructuring activities and charges we have taken in response  during the third quarter of the cumulative pre tax results for the past months of certain taxing jurisdictions reached or nearly reached loss positions 
while we have seen signs that cause us to be optimistic about the future  we are likely to be adding to the accumulated pre tax losses in these jurisdictions before the projected return to profitability of these operations 
we may be able to use some of these assets to reduce taxes payable in coming quarters or by carrying back to prior years 
further  we anticipate being able to remove the valuation allowances in future periods when positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence from the relevant look back period 
however  the actual timing and amount of potential removal of the valuation allowances by jurisdiction currently cannot be reliably estimated 
the short term consequence of being unable to record deferred tax benefits will cause our effective tax rate to be volatile  possibly changing significantly from period to period 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate during reflects the largely non deductible nature of the goodwill impairment charge and non deductible foreign interest  as well as the impact of a million increase in deferred tax asset valuation allowances resulting from the change to loss positions in certain jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate for reflects the impact from discrete benefits and valuation allowance changes  as well as the impact from a shift in the mix of pretax income  reflecting a higher proportion of international earnings taxed at lower rates 
the discrete items include a benefit of approximately million from the reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions and a local jurisdiction ruling that secured certain prior year filing positions 
additionally in  because of a jurisdictional restructuring  changes in foreign country tax law and certain book to tax return adjustments  we recognized tax benefits totaling million  primarily related to eliminations of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
in general  the effective tax rate in future periods can be affected by variability in our mix of domestic and foreign income  the variance of actual results to projected results  utilization of deferred tax assets  the statutory tax rates in various jurisdictions  changes in the rules related to accounting for income taxes  outcomes from tax audits that regularly are in process and our assessment of the need for accruals for uncertain tax positions 
the company periodically seeks to limit future tax expense by entering into tax ruling agreements with international jurisdictions 
as part of the process of obtaining these tax ruling agreements  it is possible that the company may have to concede significant tax attributes in the negotiating process which may increase tax expense 
such a concession should not have a near term cash tax impact 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   we had approximately million in cash and equivalents and another million available under our asset based credit facility based on the december borrowing base certificate 
we consider our resources adequate to satisfy our cash needs at least over the next twelve months 
we anticipate that market conditions will continue to be challenging through  and in response  we are focused on maximizing cash flow 
we have made strong progress towards reducing inventory levels and remain focused on accelerating the collection of our accounts receivable balances 
during the first half of  we entered into sale leaseback transactions and sales of certain assets  and during the third quarter of  we entered into a committed factoring arrangement in france that allows us to sell certain foreign trade receivables to a third party which provides up to approximately million additional liquidity  depending on the level of eligible receivables and currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had not sold any receivables under this agreement 
we hold cash throughout our service areas  but we principally manage our cash through regional headquarters in north america and europe 
we may move cash between those regions from time to time through short term transactions and have used these cash transfers at the end of fiscal quarterly periods to pay down borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities 
although such transfers and debt repayments took place during the first three quarters of  we completed a non taxable distribution to the us in the amount of million during the fourth quarter of  thereby permanently repatriating this cash 
additional distributions  including distributions of foreign earnings or changes in long term arrangements could result in significant additional us tax payments and income tax expense 
currently  there are no plans to change our expectation of foreign earnings reinvestment or the long term nature of our intercompany arrangements  though accounting impacts of any change in these classifications would be recognized in the period of the change 
on september   the company entered into a credit agreement the agreement with a group of lenders  which provides for an asset based  multi currency revolving credit facility the facility of up to billion 
the amount that can be drawn on the facility at any given time is determined based on percentages of certain accounts receivable  inventory and credit card receivables the borrowing base 
at december   the company was eligible to borrow approximately million of the facility 
the facility includes a sub facility of up to million which is available to certain of the company s european subsidiaries the european borrowers 
certain of the company s domestic subsidiaries the domestic guarantors guaranty the obligations under the facility 
the agreement also provides for a letter of credit sub facility of up to million 
all loans borrowed under the agreement may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed from time to time until september  or  in the event that the company s existing senior notes are not repaid  then february   on which date the facility matures 
all amounts borrowed under the facility  as well as the obligations of the domestic guarantors  are secured by a lien on the company s and such domestic guarantors accounts receivables  inventory  cash and deposit accounts 
all amounts borrowed by the european borrowers under the facility are secured by a lien on such european borrowers accounts receivable  inventory  cash and deposit accounts  as well as certain other assets 
at the company s option  borrowings made pursuant to the agreement bear interest at either  i the alternate base rate defined as the higher of the prime rate as announced by the agent and the federal funds rate plus of or ii the adjusted libor rate defined as the libor rate as adjusted for statutory revenues plus  in either case  a certain margin based on the aggregate average availability under the facility 
the agreement also contains representations  warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  and default provisions which are conditions precedent to borrowing 
the most significant of these covenants and default provisions include a capital expenditure limitation of million in any fiscal year and limitations in certain circumstances on acquisitions  dispositions  share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends 
the cash dividend restrictions are based on the then current and proforma fixed charge coverage ratio and borrowing availability at the point of consideration 
the company has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants at december  the facility also includes provisions whereby if the global availability is less than 
table of contents million  or the european availability is below million  the company s cash collections go first to the agent to satisfy outstanding borrowings 
further  if total availability falls below million  a fixed charge coverage ratio test is required which  based on current forecasts  could effectively eliminate additional borrowing under the facility 
any event of default that is not cured within the permitted period  including non payment of amounts when due  any debt in excess of million becoming due before the scheduled maturity date  or the acquisition of more than of the ownership of the company by any person or group  could result in a termination of the facility and all amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable 
at december   we had approximately million of available credit under our asset based credit facility the facility 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and there were letters of credit outstanding under the facility totaling approximately million 
an additional million of letters of credit were outstanding under separate agreements 
average borrowings under the facility from december  to june  were approximately million at an average interest rate of 
we did not borrow under our asset based credit facility during the second half of in addition to our borrowings under the facility  we had short term borrowings of million 
these borrowings primarily represent outstanding balances under various local currency credit facilities for our international subsidiaries that had an effective interest rate at the end of the year of approximately 
the majority of these short term borrowings represent outstanding balances on uncommitted lines of credit  which do not contain financial covenants 
in december  the company s credit rating was downgraded which provided the counterparty to the company s private label credit card program the right to terminate the agreement and require the company to repurchase the outstanding balance credit card receivables 
the company and the counterparty subsequently amended the agreement to permanently eliminate this provision 
the company maintains a million letter of credit in support of this agreement 
redeemable preferred stock issuance on june   we issued  shares of series a redeemable convertible participating perpetual preferred stock series a preferred stock  and  shares of series b redeemable conditional convertible participating perpetual preferred stock series b preferred stock together the preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
each share of preferred stock has an initial liquidation preference of  and the conversion rate of per common share allow the two series of preferred stock to be initially convertible into million shares of common stock 
the conversion rate is subject to anti dilution adjustments 
in compliance with the rules of the new york stock exchange  office depot requested shareholder approval for the conversion and voting rights for these shares 
approval was received at the shareholder meeting on october  dividends on the preferred stock are payable quarterly and will be paid in kind or  in cash  only to the extent that the company has funds legally available for such payment and a cash dividend is declared by the company s board of directors and allowed by credit facilities 
the company s asset based credit facility currently limits the ability to make such payments 
the company may seek modifications to the credit facility to allow for dividends to be paid in cash 
if not paid in cash  an amount equal to the cash dividend due will be added to the liquidation preference and measured for accounting purposes at fair value 
the dividend rate will be reduced to a if  at any time after june   the closing price of the company s common stock is greater than or equal to per share for a period of consecutive trading days  or b if  at any time after june   the closing price of the company s common stock is greater than or equal to per share for a period of consecutive trading days 
the board of directors approved dividends equal to the stated dividend rate on the preferred stock for periods through january  the stated rate dividend has been added to the liquidation preference of the respective series a and series b preferred stock  in lieu of making a cash payment 
this million increase in liquidation preference in lieu of a cash payment has no impact on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents for accounting purposes  the company measured the fair value of the dividend using a binomial simulation model that captured the intrinsic value of the underlying common stock on the declaration date and the option value of the shares and future dividends 
the dividend resulted in million in the aggregate  which includes the million increase in liquidation preference  being charged against additional paid in capital and added to the preferred stock carrying value as of december  after the third anniversary of issuance the preferred stock is redeemable  in whole or in part  at the option of the company  subject to the right of the holder to first convert the preferred stock the company proposes to redeem 
the redemption price is initially of the liquidation preference amount and decreases by each year until reaching after june  at any time after june   if the closing price of the common stock is greater than or equal to per share for a period of consecutive trading days  the preferred stock is redeemable at of the liquidation preference amount  in whole or in part  at the option of the company  subject to the right of the holder to first convert the preferred stock the company proposes to redeem 
the preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the holder at of the liquidation preference in the event of certain fundamental change provisions as defined in the certificate of designations for each series  including sale  bankruptcy  or delisting of our common stock 
cash flows cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflects a reduction in business performance related to weak economic conditions 
depreciation and amortization decreased by approximately million year over year primarily reflecting the impairment of fixed and intangible assets recorded in the fourth quarter of although we did experience lower levels of bad debt expense  the decrease in charges for losses on inventories and receivables resulted primarily from lower charges for shrinkage in  compared to as previously discussed  the company recognized valuation allowances of approximately million related to deferred tax assets during the third quarter of this represents a non cash expense  and therefore  it has been added back to our net loss in the consolidated statements of cash flows to arrive at cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  net cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of non cash charges and increases in accruals for severance and lease obligations 
we received dividends from our joint venture in mexico of approximately million in working capital was a source of cash of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the source in was driven by our continued focus on collecting accounts receivable balances and controlling our inventory levels 
working capital is influenced by a number of factors  including the aging of inventory and timing of vendor payments 
the timing of payments is subject to variability during the year depending on a variety of factors  including the flow of goods  credit terms  timing of promotions  vendor production planning  new product introductions and working capital management

during  we acquired a canada based office products delivery company 
additionally in both and  we funded previously accrued acquisition related payments for former owners of entities acquired in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million compared to a use of cash of million in the source in resulted from our issuance of redeemable preferred stock during the second quarter

at the end of  borrowings under that facility totaled approximately million  all of which was repaid during this revolving credit facility was replaced with our asset based credit facility during the third quarter of  which had an outstanding balance of approximately million at the end of in conjunction with our asset based credit facility  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately million in in addition to repayments on the revolving credit facility  we also repaid certain other borrowings related to our international subsidiaries and made payments on capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted from higher levels of short term borrowings to support our working capital needs 
the board of directors has historically authorized a series of common stock repurchase plans  the latest of which is a million authorization in under a previously approved plan  we purchased million shares at a cost of approximately million in we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during or  and as of december  the entire million remained available for additional repurchases under the most recent board approved plan 
however  common stock repurchases are currently prohibited under our asset based credit facility and  in certain circumstances  require prior approval under our preferred stock agreements 
proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee related plans totaled million in additionally  upon the issuance of certain restricted stock awards  employees surrendered shares to the company equal to approximately million in in exchange for our settlement of their taxes due on these shares 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we maintain a merchant services agreement with a third party financial services company related to our private label credit card program 
under the terms of this agreement  we have recourse for most private label credit card receivables transferred to the third party 
this arrangement is a component of our overall liquidity resources  which we consider adequate to satisfy our cash needs at least over the next twelve months 
we record an estimate for losses on these receivables as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
this liability totaled approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the total outstanding balance of credit card receivables transferred was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
additionally  during the third quarter of  we entered into a committed accounts receivable factoring arrangement in france that allows us to sell certain foreign trade receivables to a third party 
as of december   we had not sold any receivables under this agreement 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  other than the agreements described in the preceding paragraph and operating leases  which are included in the table below 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt obligations short term borrowings and other capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other liabilities total contractual cash obligations long term debt obligations consist primarily of our million senior notes and the associated contractual interest payments 
also included in this amount are the expected payments principal and interest on certain long term debt obligations related to our international subsidiaries 
short term borrowings consist of amounts outstanding under subsidiary lines of credit 
the present value of these obligations are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 
the operating lease obligations presented reflect future minimum lease payments due under the non cancelable portions of our leases as of december  our operating lease obligations are described in note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the table above  sublease income is distributed by period 
purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that are enforceable and legally binding on us that meet any of the following criteria they are non cancelable  we would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled  or we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services 
if the obligation is non cancelable  the entire value of the contract is included in the table 
if the obligation is cancelable  but we would incur a penalty if cancelled  the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation 
if we can unilaterally terminate the agreement simply by providing a certain number of days notice or by 
table of contents paying a termination fee  we have included the amount of the termination fee or the amount that would be paid over the notice period 
as of december   purchase obligations include television  radio and newspaper advertising  sports sponsorship commitments  telephone services  certain fixed assets and software licenses and service and maintenance contracts for information technology 
contracts that can be unilaterally terminated without a penalty have not been included 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million classified as deferred income taxes and other long term liabilities 
this caption primarily consists of our net long term deferred income taxes  the unfunded portion of our pension plan  deferred lease credits  liabilities under our deferred compensation plans  and accruals for uncertain tax positions 
these liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain 
as of december   accruals for uncertain tax positions  net of items offset by net operating losses  totaled approximately million 
see note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and accruals for uncertain tax positions and note i for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the pension plan and the deferred compensation plan 
the table above includes scheduled  acquisition related payments 
in addition to the above  we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements our inventory purchases from vendors are generally under evergreen arrangements with periodic updates or annual negotiated agreements 
many of these arrangements require the vendors to make payments to us or provide credits to be used against purchases if and when certain conditions are met 
we generally refer to these arrangements as vendor programs  and they typically fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the largest category is volume based rebates 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
many of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined tier  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a sound basis for our estimates 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  however  or if we form the belief at any given point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
during the fourth quarter of  it became apparent that we were not going to reach the anticipated full year purchase levels and we reduced vendor program income recognized in that period by approximately million 
no similar adjustments were required in any quarter in or the company has reached agreements with some vendors on terms that set future prices based on negotiation and recognition of historical rebate levels such that the volume based tiers discussed above have been eliminated 
an increase in these arrangements could reduce the impact of volume based estimates 
the second broad category of arrangements with our vendors is event based programs 
these arrangements can take many forms  including advertising support  special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a 
table of contents vendor s product  and various other special programs 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate for the program 
some arrangements may meet the specific  incremental  identifiable cost criteria that allow for direct operating expense offset  but such arrangements are not significant 
additionally  we receive payments from vendors for certain of our activities that lower the vendors cost to ship their product to our facilities 
vendor rebates are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates and amounts due from vendors are generally settled throughout the year based on purchase volumes 
the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are settled within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historic collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we monitor active inventory for excessive quantities and slow moving items and record adjustments as necessary to lower the value if the anticipated realizable amount is below cost 
we also identify merchandise that we plan to discontinue or have begun to phase out and assess the estimated recoverability of the carrying value 
this includes consideration of the quantity of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of current and projected market conditions 
if necessary  we record a charge to reduce the carrying value of this merchandise to our estimate of the lower of cost or realizable amount 
additional promotional activities may be initiated and markdowns may be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
we also recognize an expense in cost of sales for our estimate of physical inventory loss from theft  short shipment and other factors referred to as inventory shrink 
during the year  we adjust the estimate of our shrink rate accrual following on hand adjustments and our physical inventory results 
these changes in estimates may result in volatility within the year or impact comparisons to other periods 
during  we lowered our inventory levels to lessen working capital requirements and reduce obsolescence risk 
also  following a strategic review of our business in december  we decided to close certain underperforming stores in north america 
to facilitate these closures  we contracted with a liquidation firm that guaranteed the amount to be realized for the inventory in those stores 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million charge to adjust that inventory to the net contracted value 
that adjustment had no impact on the remaining inventory in other stores or in our supply chain 
during  we completed the closure of stores in north america and japan and certain distribution centers 
in conjunction with these closures  we recognized an additional million charge to facilitate inventory liquidation 
the company has no current plans for significant additional closures that could result in similar charges  though some level of closures should be anticipated each year 
closed store accruals and asset impairments we regularly assess the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales levels  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain operating performance targets  we may decide to close the store 
when a store is no longer used for operating purposes  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
with assistance from independent third parties to assess market conditions  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
in conjunction with the strategic review initiated in the fourth quarter of  we closed stores in north america and stores in japan 
the lease related costs associated with these closures  which totaled approximately million and million in and  respectively  were recorded as the facilities closed 
these costs were calculated based on our assumption of an extended vacancy period  three years in most cases  reflecting the slow economic conditions and the estimated sublease rates available in 
table of contents the future 
these commitments with no economic benefit to the company were discounted at the credit adjusted discount rate at the time of each location closure 
future fluctuations in the economy and the market demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
because the and facility closures are considered part of a company wide business review  the accretion of the discounted lease liability and potential future positive and negative adjustments to the recorded amounts from settlements or changes in market conditions will be recognized at the corporate level  outside of the determination of division operating profit 
residual costs and benefits of closures from other periods are included in division operating profit 
in addition to the decision about whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of a store s future cash flows 
our impairment analysis builds a cash flow model at the individual store level  beginning with recent store performance and trending the anticipated future results based on chain wide and individual store initiatives 
if the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
during  we recognized impairment charges of approximately million  which were primarily driven by the significant economic downturn 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in our tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
when we believe the realization of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
because of the downturn in our performance during this recessionary period  as well as the significant restructuring activities and charges we have taken in response  we established valuation allowances totaling approximately million during the charge to establish the valuation allowance followed the third quarter condition of reaching or nearly reaching a cumulative month cumulative loss position in two taxing jurisdictions 
judgment is required in projecting when operations will be sufficiently positive to allow a conclusion that utilization of the deferred tax assets will once again be more likely than not 
positive performance in subsequent periods and projections of future positive performance will need to be evaluated against this existing negative evidence 
our effective tax rate in future periods may be positively or negatively impacted by changes in related judgments or pre tax operations 
deferred tax assets without valuation allowances remain in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly  with the cumulative effect of a change in the anticipated annual rate reflected in the tax provision of that period 
such changes can result in significant interim reporting volatility 
we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required 
we generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 

table of contents preferred stock paid in kind dividends in june  we issued million of redeemable preferred stock 
the preferred stock carries a stated dividend of  subject to future decreases in certain circumstances  and allows for payment in cash or an increase in the preferred stock s liquidation preference 
the company s asset based credit facility includes provisions that currently limit the payment of cash dividends on any stock until the company s fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  is at least 
this provision has precluded the company from considering payment in cash of the first two quarterly preferred stock dividends 
the valuation for accounting purposes of the dividend paid in kind requires significant judgment to determine the estimated fair value 
the company has used a binomial simulation model to measure values of multiple possible outcomes of the various provisions in the agreements that could impact whether the dividend rate would change based on future stock price performance  whether the company would issue a notice to call the preferred shares and whether the holders would convert their preferred stock into common stock 
while the fair value of preferred stock dividends paid in kind has no standing in the contractual rights to liquidation preference of the preferred shareholders nor any cash impact on the company  it impacts the measurement of net income available to common shareholders and reduces earnings per share 
changes in the valuation assumptions such as the risk adjusted rate  stock price volatility and time to call or convert can impact the estimated fair value and therefore the amount reported as net income available to common shareholders and earnings pre share 
however  the valuation is most sensitive to changes in the underlying common stock price 
for example  a one dollar change in the common stock price from approximate recent levels  holding all other factors constant  could change the estimated quarterly fair value amount by approximately million 
this projected sensitivity would not be valid in many circumstances  is provided only for an order of magnitude impact and should not be relied upon for planning purposes 
the company believes the model used to estimate fair value is reasonable and appropriate  but the reported dividend amount could change significantly in future periods based on changes in the underlying common stock price and the model inputs 
the company may seek modification to its asset based credit facility to allow for preferred stock dividends to be paid in cash  which would eliminate these judgments and estimates for any dividend paid in cash 
significant trends  developments and uncertainties competitive factors over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs  as well as grocery and drugstore chains  have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
warehouse clubs have expanded beyond their in store assortment by adding catalogs and web sites from which a much broader assortment of products may be ordered 
we also face competition from other office supply stores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and drug stores and grocery chains  carry basic office supply products 
some of them also feature technology products 
many of them may price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry that could impact our results 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in office supply stores and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporations 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry that could impact our results 
we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 

table of contents economic factors our customers in the north american retail division and many of our customers in the north american business solutions division are predominantly small and home office businesses 
accordingly  these customers may continue to curtail their spending in reaction to macroeconomic conditions  such as changes in the housing market and commodity costs  higher credit costs  credit availability and other factors 
the downturn in the global economy experienced over the past two years negatively impacted our sales and profits 
liquidity factors historically  we have generated positive cash flow from operating activities and have had access to broad financial markets that provide the liquidity we need to operate our business 
together  these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs  as well as invest in business expansion through new store openings  capital improvements and acquisitions 
however  due to the downturn in the global economy our operating results have diminished 
in june  we issued million of redeemable preferred stock and in september  we entered into a billion asset based credit facility to provide liquidity 
continued distress in the financial markets has resulted in significant volatility in the capital markets and diminished liquidity and credit availability 
there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be adversely impacted by changes in the financial markets and the global economy 
in addition  deterioration in our financial results could negatively impact our credit ratings 
the tightening of the credit markets or a downgrade in our credit ratings could make it more difficult for us to access funds  to refinance our existing indebtedness  to enter into agreements for new indebtedness or to obtain funding through the issuance of securities 
market sensitive risks and positions the company has adopted an enterprise risk management process patterned after the principles set out by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso in management utilizes a common view of exposure identification and risk management 
a process is in place for periodic risk reviews and identification of appropriate mitigation strategies 
we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
interest rate changes on obligations may result from external market factors  as well as changes in our credit rating 
we manage our exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored and adjusted to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates or foreign currency rates is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of less than million 
market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below dollars in thousands carrying value fair value risk sensitivity carrying value fair value risk sensitivity million senior notes asset based credit arrangement the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 

table of contents foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business in various countries outside the united states where the functional currency of the country is not the us dollar 
while our company sells directly or indirectly to customers in countries  the principal operations of our international division are in countries with euro and british pound functional currencies 
we continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we also are subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
at december   the notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain inventory exposures was million 
this amount was million at its highest point during also  from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange forward transactions to protect against possible changes in exchange rates related to scheduled or anticipated cash movements among our operating entities 
generally  we evaluate the performance of our international businesses by focusing on the local currency results of the business  and not with regard to the translation into us dollars  as the latter is impacted by external factors 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat seasonal  with sales lower during the second quarter 
certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles 
additionally  business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board the fasb has codified a single source of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the accounting standards codification 
unless needed to clarify a point to readers  we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes 
there are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
