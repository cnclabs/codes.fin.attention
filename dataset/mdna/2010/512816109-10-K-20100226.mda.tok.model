table of contents lamar advertising company the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
overview the company s net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the company 
the company relies on sales of advertising space for its revenues  and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions  as well as trends in the advertising industry 
advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions  which affect the rates that the company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales or occupancy on its displays 
the severe economic downturn that began in the fourth quarter of affected the company as well as the advertising industry 
the company had fewer customers in which resulted in lower occupancy and a reduction in sales 
while the company anticipates this will continue into  we took steps to reduce operating and capitalized expenditures in order to offset this reduction in revenue during and will continue this practice into historically  the company has increased the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates by completing strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets 
since december   the company completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  which included the issuance of  shares of lamar advertising company class a common stock valued at the time of issuance at approximately million 
the company has financed its historical acquisitions and intends to finance any of its future acquisition activity from available cash  borrowings under its senior credit facility and the issuance of class a common stock 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
however  during  the company reduced its acquisition activity significantly by completing acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets for a purchase price of million  which was a reduction of approximately million over the same period in due to the ongoing economic recession  the company will continue to limit its acquisition activity during growth of the company s business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays  the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts  and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment 
the following table presents a breakdown of capitalized expenditures for the past three years in thousands billboard traditional billboard digital logos transit land and buildings pp e total capital expenditures we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million in results of operations the following table presents certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and year ended december  net revenues operating expenses direct advertising expenses general and administrative expenses corporate expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense net loss income 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues decreased million or to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the same period in this decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in billboard net revenues of million  or  over the prior period  a million decrease in transit revenue  or  over the prior period  offset by a million increase in logo revenue  of  over the prior period 
the decrease in billboard net revenue of million was a result of decreased rate and occupancy due to a reduction in advertising spending by our customers resulting from the current economic recession  which began in the fourth quarter of the million decrease in transit revenue consists of a million decrease due to lost transit contracts and a decrease of million due to the current economic recession 
net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to acquisition adjusted net revenue for the year ended december   decreased million or primarily as a result of the reduction in rate and occupancy due to the current economic recession that began in the fourth quarter of and continued throughout see reconciliations below 
operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in there was a million increase in non cash compensation expense related to performance based compensation  offset by a million decrease in operating expenses related to the cost of operating the company s core assets and a million decrease in corporate expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily a result of accelerated depreciation on dismantled structures during due to the above factors  operating income decreased million to million for year ended december  compared to million for the same period in during  the company extinguished million in principal amount of its convertible notes due series b  at an average purchase price of yielding a gain of approximately million  which was offset by transaction costs and other non cash charges of million related to the notes  resulting in a net gain of million 
interest expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to issuance of million principal amount senior notes due and the increase in interest rates resulting from the amendments to our senior credit facility in april the decrease in operating income and the increase in interest expense described above resulted in a million decrease in income before income taxes 
this decrease in income resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of million for the year ended december  over the same period in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
as a result of the above factors  the company recognized a net loss for the year ended december  of million  as compared to net income of million for the same period in reconciliations because acquisitions occurring after december  the acquired assets have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented  we provide acquisition adjusted net revenue  which adjusts our net revenue by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets prior to our acquisition of them for the same time frame that those assets were owned in we provide this information as a supplement to net revenues to enable investors to compare periods in and on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions 
management uses this comparison to assess how well our core assets are performing 
acquisition adjusted net revenue is not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for this adjustment  we measure the amount of pre acquisition revenue generated by the acquired assets during the period in that corresponds with the actual period we have owned the acquired assets in to the extent within the period to which this report relates 
we refer to this adjustment as acquisition net revenue

table of contents comparison of net revenue to acquisition adjusted net revenue year ended december  in thousands reported net revenue acquisition net revenue adjusted totals year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues decreased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the same period in this decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in billboard net revenues of million  or  over the prior period and a million decrease in logo sign revenue over the prior period due to contracts lost in the fourth quarter of the decrease in billboard net revenue of million was a result of decreased occupancy due to a reduction in advertising spending resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions which accelerated in the fourth quarter of the million decrease in logo revenue was a result of internal growth of approximately million was offset by a decrease of million of revenue due to the loss of various logo contracts 
net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to acquisition adjusted net revenue for the year ended december   decreased million  or  primarily as a result of the reduction in occupancy primarily in the fourth quarter of as discussed above 
see reconciliations below 
operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in there was an million decrease in non cash compensation expense related to performance based compensation  offset by a million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of acquired outdoor advertising assets and increases in the cost of operating the company s core assets and a million increase in corporate expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily a result of capital expenditures of million related to digital billboards which are depreciated using a shorter expected life than the traditional billboards 
due to the above factors  operating income decreased million to million for year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the company recognized a million return on investment compared to a million gain as a result of the sale of a private company recognized in the first quarter of  which represents a decrease of over the prior period 
interest expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to a decrease in interest rates on variable rate debt offset by increased debt balances 
the decrease in operating income  the decrease in gain on disposition of investment  and the increase in interest expense described above resulted in a million decrease in income before income taxes 
this decrease in income resulted in a decrease in the income tax expense of million for the year ended december  over the same period in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  which is greater than the statutory rates due to permanent differences resulting from non deductible expenses

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to long lived asset recovery  intangible assets  goodwill impairment  deferred taxes  asset retirement obligations and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events and  where applicable  established valuation techniques 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 

table of contents long lived asset recovery 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangibles comprise a significant portion of the company s total assets 
property  plant and equipment of billion and intangible assets of million are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset before interest expense 
these undiscounted cash flow projections are based on management s assumptions surrounding future operating results and the anticipated future economic environment 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  an impairment of these intangible assets may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined 
during the year ended december  there were no indications that an impairment test was necessary 
intangible assets 
the company has significant intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet 
intangible assets primarily represent site locations of million and customer relationships of million associated with the company s acquisitions 
the fair values of intangible assets recorded are determined using discounted cash flow models that require management to make assumptions related to future operating results  including projecting net revenue growth discounted using current cost of capital rates  of each acquisition and the anticipated future economic environment 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  an impairment of these intangibles may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined 
historically no impairment charge has been required with respect to the company s intangible assets 
goodwill impairment 
the company has a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet and must perform an impairment test of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test requires management to determine the implied fair value of its reporting units and compare it to its book value including goodwill 
to the extent the book value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the company would be required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indicator that the reporting unit may be impaired 
impairment testing involves various estimates and assumptions  which could vary  and an analysis of relevant market data and market capitalization 
we have identified two reporting units logo operations and billboard operations in accordance with asc no changes have been made to our reporting units from the prior period 
the reporting units and their carrying amounts of goodwill as of december  and are as follows carrying value of goodwill in thousands december  december  billboard operations logo operations we believe there are numerous facts and circumstances that need to be considered when estimating the reasonableness of the reporting unit s estimated fair value  especially in the current recession 
in conducting our impairment test  we assessed the reasonableness of the reporting unit s estimated fair value based on both market capitalization and discounted future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow analysis incorporated various growth rate assumptions and discounting based on a present value factor 
consideration of market capitalization the company first considered its market capitalization as of its annual impairment testing date of december the market capitalization of its class a common stock as of december  was billion compared to stockholders equity of million as of that date  resulting in an excess of approximately billion 
the company considers market capitalization over book value a strong indicator that no impairment of goodwill exists as of the measurement date of december  the following table presents the market capitalization and aggregate book value of the reporting units as of december  market equity book value capitalization in thousands aggregate values as of december  market capitalization was calculated using a day average of the closing prices of the class a common stock beginning trading days prior to the measurement date 

table of contents calculations of fair value using discounted cash flow analysis we also estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis that compares the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit to the book value of the reporting unit 
the discount rate and projected revenue and ebitda earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization growth rates are significant assumptions utilized in our calculation of the present value of cash flows used to estimate fair value of the reporting units 
these assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain risks including deterioration in industry and economic conditions 
our discount rate assumption is based on our cost of capital  which we determine annually based on our estimated costs of debt and equity relative to our capital structure 
as of december  our weighted average cost of capital wacc was approximately  which is slightly higher than our historical rate due to increased market risk given the current economic conditions 
based on our analysis  our wacc must exceed before the second step of the impairment test would be required 
in developing our revenue and ebitda growth rates  we consider our historical performance and current market trends in the markets in which we operate 
the following table describes the growth rates used in our analysis  which indicated no impairment charge was required  compared to our recent historical rates achieved compound annual growth rates cagr revenue ebitda year year historical projected rate historical projected rate billboard operations logo operations calculated based on the company s historical results from to our december  discounted cash flow analysis does not indicate the need for step two of the impairment test unless the compound annual growth rate cagr  calculated using projections over the next years  for revenue declines to less than for our billboard operations and less than for our logo operations  and the cagr for ebitda declines to less than for our billboard operations and less than for our logo operations 
assumptions used in our impairment test  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecast and operating plans 
in addition  our forecasts were based on the current economic recession continuing through a prolonged recession or changes in our forecasts could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
in addition  these assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain risks discussed in risk factors in item a of this annual report 
for additional information about goodwill  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and aggregate book value of the reporting units as of december  equity book value fair value in thousands aggregate values as of december  fair value is calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis described above 
based upon the company s annual review as of december   using both the market capitalization approach and discounted cash flow analysis  there was no indication of a potential impairment and  therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not required and no impairment charge was necessary 
deferred taxes 
as of december   the company determined that its deferred tax assets of million  a component of which is the company s operating loss carry forward  net of existing valuation allowances  are fully realizable due to the existence of certain deferred tax liabilities of approximately million that are anticipated to reverse during the carry forward period 
the company bases this determination by projecting taxable income over the relevant period 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
for a more detailed description  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents asset retirement obligations 
the company had an asset retirement obligation of million as of december  this liability relates to the company s obligation upon the termination or non renewal of a lease to dismantle and remove its billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition 
the company records the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which they are incurred 
the liability is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset s carrying amount 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset 
in calculating the liability  the company calculates the present value of the estimated cost to dismantle using an average cost to dismantle  adjusted for inflation and market risk 
this calculation includes of the company s billboard structures on leased land which currently consist of approximately  structures 
the company uses a year retirement period based on historical operating experience in its core markets  including the actual time that billboard structures have been located on leased land in such markets and the actual length of the leases in the core markets  which includes the initial term of the lease  plus any renewal period 
historical third party cost information is used with respect to the dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on credit rates historically available to the company 
stock based compensation 
share based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
share based payment accounting requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the company has elected to use the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions  including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected life is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and forfeitures of stock options by our employees 
upon the adoption of share based payment accounting  we used a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption as allowed under share based payment accounting 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
share based payment accounting requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of share based payment accounting in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under share based payment accounting may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
during  we recorded million as compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases 
we evaluate and adjust our assumptions on an annual basis

allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts based on the payment patterns of its customers

if the current economic recession is prolonged or increases in severity  the inability of customers to pay may occur and the allowance for doubtful accounts may need to be increased  which will result in additional bad debt expense in future years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lamar advertising company and lamar media corp 
lamar advertising company is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with variable rate debt instruments issued by its wholly owned subsidiary lamar media corp 
the information below summarizes the company s interest rate risk associated with its principal variable rate debt instruments outstanding at december   and should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
loans under lamar media corp 
s senior credit facility bear interest at variable rates equal to the jpmorgan chase prime rate or libor plus the applicable margin 
because the jpmorgan chase prime rate or libor may increase or decrease at any time  the company is exposed to market risk as a result of the impact that changes in these base rates may have on the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the senior credit facility 
increases in the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the senior credit facility would result in increased interest expense and a reduction in the company s net income 
at december  there was approximately billion of aggregate indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility  or approximately of the company s outstanding long term debt on that date  bearing interest at variable rates 
the aggregate interest expense for with respect to borrowings under the senior credit facility was million  and the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under this credit facility during was 
assuming that the weighted average interest rate was basis points higher that is rather than  then the company s interest expense would have been approximately million higher resulting in a million decrease in the company s net income 
the company attempted to mitigate the interest rate risk resulting from its variable interest rate long term debt instruments by issuing fixed rate long term debt instruments and maintaining a balance over time between the amount of the company s variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness 
in addition  the company has the capability under the senior credit facility to fix the interest rates applicable to its borrowings at an amount equal to libor plus the applicable margin for periods of up to twelve months in certain cases with the consent of the lenders  which would allow the company to mitigate the impact of short term fluctuations in market interest rates 
in the event of an increase in interest rates  the company may take further actions to mitigate its exposure 
the company cannot guarantee  however  that the actions that it may take to mitigate this risk will be feasible or that  if these actions are taken  that they will be effective
