item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results 
there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview momenta is a biotechnology company specializing in the characterization and process engineering of complex molecules 
these complex molecules include proteins  polypeptides  and cell surface polysaccharides  like heparan sulfate proteoglycans  or hspgs 
this results in a diversified product pipeline of complex generic  follow on biologic  and novel drugs 
these product opportunities are derived from our proprietary  innovative technology platform which we leverage to study the structure thorough characterization of chemical components  structure process understand  design and control of manufacturing process  and structure activity understand and relate structure to biological and clinical activity of complex molecule drugs 
our complex generics and follow on biologics activities are focused on building a thorough understanding of the structure process activity of complex molecule drugs to develop generic versions of marketed products 
while we use a similar analytical and development approach across all of our product candidates  we tailor that approach for each specific product candidate 
our first objective is to apply our core analytical technology to thoroughly characterize the structure of the marketed product 
by defining the chemical composition of multiple batches of the marketed product  we are able to develop an equivalence window which captures the inherent variability of the innovator s manufacturing process 
using this information we then build an extensive understanding of the structure process relationship to thoroughly understand  design and control our manufacturing process to reproducibly manufacture an equivalent version of the marketed product 
where necessary  and as required by the us food and drug administration  or fda  we will supplement an application with additional supportive structure activity data eg  immunogenicity  pharmacodynamics 
our goal is to obtain fda approval for and commercialize  either directly or with collaborative partners  complex generic and follow on biologic products thereby providing high quality  effective  safe and affordable medicines to patients in need 
our two most advanced complex generic product candidates target marketed products which were originally approved by the fda as new drug applications  or ndas 
therefore  we were able to access the existing generic regulatory pathway and submitted abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  for these generic candidates 
m enoxaparin is designed to be a generic version of lovenox enoxaparin sodium injection  a low molecular weight heparin  or lmwh  used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis  or dvt  and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes  or acs 
lovenox is a complex mixture of polysaccharide chains derived from naturally sourced heparin 
our second major generic product candidate is m  a generic version of copaxone glatiramer acetate injection  a drug that is indicated for the reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis  or rrms 
copaxone consists of a complex mixture of polypeptide chains 
with m  we have extended our core characterization and process engineering capabilities from the characterization of complex polysaccharide mixtures to include the characterization of complex polypeptide mixtures 
the andas for both m enoxaparin and m are currently under fda review 
in addition to our two complex generic product candidates  our follow on biologics program further extends our proprietary technology platform to include the characterization and engineering of therapeutic protein products 
by thoroughly characterizing these molecules  which are derived from natural or cell based manufacturing processes  we seek to gain a deeper understanding of the 
table of contents relationship between the multiple steps involved in their manufacturing processes and the final product compositions 
our goal is to replicate our development approach with m enoxaparin and m and pursue the development and commercialization of multiple biogeneric designated by fda to be substitutable with the marketed product or biosimilar designated by fda not to be directly substitutable with the marketed drug products 
our novel drug program leverages our characterization and process engineering capabilities to develop novel drugs by studying the structure activity of complex mixtures 
we are targeting our efforts to understand the relationship between structure and the biological and therapeutic activity of various complex molecule drug candidates 
our goal is to capitalize on the structural diversity and multi targeting potential of these complex molecules to engineer novel drug candidates that we believe will meet key unmet medical needs in various diseases 
while we believe that our capabilities to engineer improved and novel complex molecule drug candidates can be applied across several product categories with significant therapeutic potential  our most advanced efforts have been in the area of hspgs 
our lead novel hspg based drug candidate  m  has been engineered to possess what we believe will be an improved therapeutic profile compared with other currently marketed products to support the treatment of acs 
m  our second novel hspg based drug candidate  is in early development as a potential anti cancer agent 
we also are seeking to discover and develop additional novel hspg based drugs  as well as improved and novel protein drug candidates by applying our technology to better understand the function of these complex molecules in biological processes 
since our inception in may  we have incurred annual net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we recognized net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we develop our product candidates  expand our research and development activities and prepare for the potential commercial launch of our product candidates 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions or licensing of rights to additional technologies  products or assets that fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
our revenues for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  have been derived from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and primarily consist of amounts earned by us for reimbursement by sandoz of research and development services and development costs for certain programs 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our capital resource expenditures to the research and development of our product candidates 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any revenue from product sales and are uncertain whether or not we will generate any revenue from the sale of products over the next several years 
we have recognized  in the aggregate  million of revenue from our inception through december  this revenue was derived entirely from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration 
we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of research and development payments  profit sharing payments  milestone payments and royalties in connection with our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and similar future collaborative or strategic relationships 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of research and development and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  contract research and manufacturing costs  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs development programs m enoxaparin our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin  is designed to be a generic version of lovenox  a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polysaccharide chains 
lovenox is a widely prescribed lmwh used for the prevention and treatment of dvt and to support the treatment of acs 
under our sandoz collaboration  we work with sandoz exclusively to develop  manufacture and commercialize m enoxaparin in the us and sandoz is responsible for funding substantially all of the us related m enoxaparin development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs 
the total cost of development and commercialization  and the timing of m enoxaparin product launch  are subject to uncertainties relating to the development  regulatory approval and legal processes 
our collaborative partner  sandoz  submitted andas in its name to the fda for m enoxaparin in syringe and vial forms seeking approval to market m enoxaparin in the united states 
the fda is currently reviewing both of sandoz s m enoxaparin andas  including our manufacturing data and technology and characterization methodology 
we and sandoz are in regular communication with the fda to address any additional questions or requests that it may have as it continues the review of sandoz s application 
the fda has not requested human clinical trials at this time 
however  there can be no assurances that the fda will not require additional studies  including clinical studies  in the future and we cannot predict with a high degree of certainty the timing of any potential approval of the m enoxaparin anda by the fda 
we and sandoz are also in active dialogue with the fda regarding the sourcing and processing of our heparin supply 
we and sandoz are working together to prepare for the commercialization of m enoxaparin  if and when approved  by advancing manufacturing  supply chain  and sales and marketing objectives 
m m is designed to be a generic version of copaxone  a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polypeptide chains 
copaxone is indicated for reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with rrms 
multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration 
in north america  copaxone is marketed by teva neuroscience llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in europe  copaxone is marketed by teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
and sanofi aventis 
in december  our collaborative partner  sandoz  submitted to the fda an anda in its name containing a paragraph iv certification seeking approval to market m in the united states 
in july  the fda notified sandoz that it had accepted the anda for review as of december  in addition  the fda s published database indicates that the first substantially complete anda submitted for glatiramer acetate injection containing a paragraph iv certification was filed on december   making sandoz s anda eligible for the grant of a day generic exclusivity period upon approval 
the review of sandoz s anda is ongoing 
we and sandoz are in regular communication with the fda 
table of contents to address any additional questions or requests that it may have as it continues the review of sandoz s application 
m m is a novel anticoagulant that is a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polysaccharide chains 
m was rationally designed to capture  in a single therapy  the positive attributes of both unfractionated heparin reversibility  monitorability and broad inhibition of the coagulation cascade and lmwh adequate bioavailability and predictable pharmacokinetics to allow for convenient subcutaneous administration 
we believe that m has the potential to provide baseline anticoagulant therapy for patients diagnosed with acs who are medically managed and who may or may not require coronary intervention in order to treat their condition  as well as for patients diagnosed with stable angina who require a coronary intervention 
we believe that the properties of m observed to date in both preclinical and clinical investigations continue to support the design hypothesis and may provide physicians with a more flexible treatment option than is currently available 
acs includes several diseases ranging from unstable angina  which is characterized by chest pain at rest  to acute myocardial infarction  or heart attack  which is caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery 
currently  a majority of patients are initially medically managed with an anti clotting agent  such as lmwh or unfractionated heparin  or ufh  in combination with other therapies 
an increasing proportion of acs patients are also proceeding to early intervention with procedures such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting  or cabg 
both angioplasty and cabg require anticoagulant therapy to prevent clot formation during and immediately following the procedure 
m is designed to be a lmwh that could be used in multiple settings  including initial medical management  angioplasty or cabg 
in july  we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda for our m intravenous injection product and in october began phase clinical trials to evaluate its human safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile 
in june  we completed a phase a clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing m intravenous injection as an anticoagulant in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
this trial  known as eminence evaluation of m in percutaneous coronary intervention  enrolled approximately patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention 
patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with one of three doses of intravenous m or a standard dose of unfractionated heparin ufh 
the primary endpoint of the study was the combined incidence of clinical events defined as the composite of death  myocardial infarction  repeat revascularization  and stroke over thirty days  incidence of bleeding and thrombocytopenia over the first hours  and bailout use of glycoprotein iib iiia inhibitors and catheter thrombus during the procedure 
the primary analysis in the study provided evidence of non inferiority of the combined m group combining all three doses as compared to the ufh group within the parameters of the prospectively defined analysis 
the observed incidence of the primary endpoint was lower in all m treatment groups than in the ufh group  however it should be noted that the study was not designed or powered to detect statistically significant differences between treatments 
the incidence of serious and non serious adverse events was comparable in all treatment groups 
in march  we submitted an ind for our m subcutaneous injection product  and in may began phase clinical trials to evaluate its human safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile 
these trials have been completed 
we believe that the results of clinical trials conducted to date support continuing the evaluation of m in patients diagnosed with acs who are medically managed with or without an intervention 
we are seeking a collaborative partner to finance and support the further clinical development of m we will not start additional clinical trials until we have a partner or funding available  but we do remain committed to the product and its continued development 

table of contents m m is our next most advanced novel hspg based product candidate and is engineered to have potent anti cancer properties and low anticoagulant activity 
hspgs are complex molecules present in the tumor microenvironment which play a role in the conversion of normal cells into cancerous cells  and present growth factors  cytokines  and chemokines necessary for tumor cell growth  migration  and survival 
m is designed to exploit this biology 
data from preclinical studies have shown that m has the potential to modulate angiogenesis and tumor metastasis through a variety of hspg binding proteins 
we currently have plans to advance m into human clinical trials in the first half of general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  legal  accounting  investor relations  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility and insurance costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for legal and accounting services and other general expenses 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue revenue for was million  compared with million for and million for revenue for the year ended december  consists of amounts earned by us under our sandoz collaboration for reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs and amounts earned by us under our sandoz collaboration for amortization of the equity premium  reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs 
revenue increased million from to due primarily to a million increase in reimbursable process engineering activities associated with our m program and a million increase in reimbursable expenses associated with our m enoxaparin program  primarily for development services related to the anda review process 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in reimbursable expenses associated with our m program  as planned development activities on the m program were completed 
revenue decreased million from to due primarily to a decrease in reimbursable expenses associated with the development of m enoxaparin 
the manufacturing costs for pre launch inventory for m enoxaparin are incurred directly by sandoz and therefore do not flow through our collaborative revenues 
research and development research and development expense for was million  compared with million in and million in the increase of million  or  from to principally resulted from increases of million in manufacturing  process development and third party research costs primarily in support of our m program  million in stock based compensation expense  million in depreciation and facility related expense  million in personnel and related costs  and million in consultant costs 
these increases were offset by decreases of million in clinical development costs associated with the completion of the phase a clinical trial for our m program  a million credit to research and development expense as a result of a revision to an accrued milestone liability and a decrease of million in laboratory supplies 
the decrease of million  or  from to principally resulted from decreases of million in process development  manufacturing and third party research costs in support of our development programs  principally our m enoxaparin and m programs  million in stock based 
table of contents compensation expense  million in process research and development expense related to the parivid asset purchase  and million in consultant costs 
these decreases were offset by increases of million in personnel and related costs  million in laboratory expenses and million in depreciation expense 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase in support of our product candidates 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expenditures for our principal research and development programs for the years ended december    and  and shows the total external costs incurred by us for each of our major research and development projects 
the table excludes costs incurred by our collaboration partner on such major research and development projects 
we do not maintain or evaluate  and therefore do not allocate  internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
consequently  we do not analyze internal research and development costs by project in managing our research and development activities 
research and development expense in thousands project inception to december  development programs status m enoxaparin anda filed m anda filed m phase a other development programs discovery programs research and development internal costs total research and development expense the increase of million in external expenditures related to our m enoxaparin program from to was primarily due to increased development services related to the anda review process 
the increase in external expenditures on our m program of million from to was due to increased process development  manufacturing costs and third party research expenses 
the decrease of million in external expenditures on our m program from to was due to the completion of our phase a clinical trial in june the decrease of million in external expenditures related to our m enoxaparin program from to was primarily due to lower manufacturing activity and a shift to commercial activity being contracted directly with sandoz 
the decrease of million in external expenditures related to our m program from to was primarily related to the timing of drug process work and the investment required to support the anda filing at the end of the decrease of million in external expenditures on our m program from to was primarily attributable to start up costs incurred in for the phase a clinical trial 
the research and development internal costs consist of compensation and other expense for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs and depreciation 
the increase of million from to was due to additional research and development headcount and related costs in support of our development programs 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  from to primarily due to a decrease of million in professional fees due to a reduction in legal and consulting activities  offset by an increase of million in stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  from to due to a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense primarily due to a revision of the expected vesting date on certain performance based restricted stock awards and a decrease of million in professional fees due to a reduction in legal and consulting activities 
we expect our general and administrative expenses  including internal and external legal and business development costs that support our various product development efforts  to vary from period to period in relation to our research and development activities 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million from to and the decrease of million from to were primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million from to was primarily due to the completion of a repayment schedule on our equipment line of credit during liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and borrowings from our lines of credit and capital lease obligations 
since our inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in june  we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of million at which time all shares of preferred stock converted to common stock 
in july  we completed a follow on public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
in september  we received net proceeds of million from novartis pharma ag s purchase of  shares of our common stock in connection with our sandoz collaboration

as of december   we have received a cumulative total of million from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  million from debt financing  million from capital lease obligations and million from our landlord for leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility and additional funds from interest income 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in addition  we also hold million in restricted cash which serves as collateral for a letter of credit

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  contractual obligations in thousands total through through after license maintenance obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations after  the annual obligations  which extend indefinitely  are approximately million per year 
parivid milestone payment on august   we entered into an amendment to the asset purchase agreement  or the purchase agreement  dated april   with parivid  llc  a data integration and analysis services provider  and s 
raguram 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired certain of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of parivid related to the acquired assets in exchange for million in cash paid at closing and up to million in contingent milestone payments in a combination of cash and or stock in the manner and on the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement 
the contingent milestone payments were structured to include i potential payments of no more than million in cash if certain milestones were achieved within two years from the date of the purchase agreement the initial milestones and ii the issuance of up to million of our common stock to parivid if certain other milestones are achieved within fifteen years of the date of the purchase agreement 
pursuant to the amendment  we agreed to extend the time period for completion of the initial milestones to june   specified those initial milestones that had been achieved as of june  and  as consideration for the completion and satisfaction of the initial milestones that were achieved  agreed to pay parivid million cash and to issue  shares of our common stock at a value of per share 
in addition  in september  we made a cash payment of million to parivid  recorded as other expense  representing the difference between the net proceeds from parivid s

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and share based payments 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue we recognize revenue from research and development collaboration agreements 
we record revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenue received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services are deferred and recognized over the performance period 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue is recognized is based on estimates by management and may change over the course of the performance period 
at the inception of a collaboration agreement  we estimate the term of our performance obligation based on our development plans and our estimate of the regulatory review period 
the development plans generally include designing a manufacturing process to make the drug product  scaling up the process  contributing to the preparation of regulatory filings  further scaling up the manufacturing process to commercial scale and related development of intellectual property 
each reporting period we reassess our remaining performance obligations under the applicable collaboration arrangement by considering the time period over which any remaining development and related services to be provided prior to obtaining regulatory approval are expected to be completed 
changes in our estimate could occur due to changes in our development plans or due to changes in regulatory or legal requirements 
we have deferred upfront payments of million and million in connection with our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  respectively 
such upfront payments are being recognized over our estimated period of performance obligation  which is approximately five and a half years and six years  respectively  from the applicable collaboration inception date 
the deferral period for the upfront payment associated with our sandoz collaboration was completed during we recognize payments for the achievement of substantive  at risk milestones that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process as revenue when due or paid 
cash and cash equivalents we consider only those investments which are highly liquid  readily convertible to cash and that mature within three months from date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are carried at fair value  which approximates cost  and were primarily comprised of money market funds at december  
table of contents marketable securities available for sale debt securities are recorded at fair market value 
purchased premiums or discounts on debt securities are amortized to interest income through the stated maturities of the debt securities 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if a decline in the fair value is considered other than temporary  based on available evidence  the unrealized loss is transferred from other comprehensive income loss to the statements of operations 
there were no charges taken for other than temporary declines in fair value of marketable securities in  or realized gains and losses are reported in interest income on a specific identification basis 
during the year ended december   we recorded realized gains on marketable securities of  there were no realized gains or losses on marketable securities during the years ended december  or fair value of other financial instruments the carrying amounts of our financial instruments that are not stated at fair value  which include accounts receivable  unbilled collaboration revenue and other accrued expenses  approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
the carrying amount of our line of credit and capital lease obligations approximate their fair values due to their variable interest rates 
intangible assets we have acquired intangible assets that we value and record 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets at acquisition 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk and the cost of capital 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach when impairment indicators arise 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  we would write down the intangible asset to the discounted cash flow value 
where we cannot identify cash flows for an individual asset  our review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation in our statement of operations 
stock based compensation expense primarily relates to stock options  restricted stock and stock issued under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
we recognize stock based compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
restricted stock awards are recorded as compensation cost  based on the market value on the date of the grant  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises  the issuance of restricted stock and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected term of an option 
we believe a blended volatility rate based upon historical performance  as well as the implied volatilities of currently traded options  best reflects the expected volatility of our stock going forward 
changes in market price directly affect volatility and could cause stock based compensation expense to vary significantly in future reporting periods 
the expected term of awards represents the period of time that the awards are expected to be outstanding 
we use a blend of our own historical employee exercise and post vest termination behavior and expected term data from our peer group to arrive at the estimated expected life of an option 
we update these assumptions as needed to reflect recent historical data 
additionally  we are required to estimate forfeiture rates to approximate the number of shares that will vest in a period to which the fair value is applied 
estimated forfeitures will be adjusted to actual forfeitures upon the vest date of the cancelled options as a cumulative adjustment on a quarterly basis 
the value of our restricted stock awards is recognized as compensation cost in our consolidated statements of operations over each award s explicit or implicit service periods 
we estimate an award s implicit service period based on our best estimate of the period over which an award s vesting conditions will be achieved 
we reevaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and will recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation as of the date of an estimate revision over the revised remaining implicit service period 
in december  we revised the implicit service period for certain performance based restricted stock awards due to a change in the expected vesting date 
the impact of this change in estimate on our net loss and net loss per share was immaterial for the year ended december  for the years ended december   and  we recognized total stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option awards amounted to million  including estimated forfeitures  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of years 
as of december   the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards amounted to million  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of approximately years

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market  government secured  and high grade corporate securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of twenty four months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative  foreign currency or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
