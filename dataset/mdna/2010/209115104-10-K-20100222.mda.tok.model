risk factors the companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict  and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
see risk factors in item a 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies  which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies  long lived assets  derivative instruments  goodwill and leases 
accounting for regulated public utilities the utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the ferc and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction 
the accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under the accounting rules 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under the accounting rules 
the utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in note b to the financial statements in item the utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
the utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received 
the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 
in the event that regulatory assets of the utilities were no longer probable of recovery as required by the accounting rules  these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings 
at december   the regulatory assets for con edison and cecony were  million and  million  respectively 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees 
con edison s competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees 
the companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits 
in addition  the utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations which  as described in note b to the financial statements in item  reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred 
in applying these accounting policies  the companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  discount rates  health care cost trends and future compensation 
see notes a  e and f to the financial statements in item for information about the companies pension and other postretirement benefits  the actuarial assumptions  actual performance  amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for  and the cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets  assumptions for future periods  contributions and benefit experience 
con edison s and cecony s current estimates for are increases  compared with  in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of million and million  respectively 
the discount rates used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs are percent and percent  respectively  and the expected return on plan assets tax exempt assets for postretirement benefit accounting costs is percent 

table of contents the discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly rated aa and aaa  by moody s corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments 
in determining the health care cost trend rate  the companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends 
the following table illustrates the effect on pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above  while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant millions of dollars actuarial assumption change in assumption pension other postretirement benefits total increase in accounting cost discount rate con edison cecony expected return on plan assets con edison cecony health care trend rate con edison cecony increase in projected benefit obligation discount rate con edison cecony health care trend rate con edison cecony a percentage point variation in the actual annual return in  as compared with the expected annual asset return of percent  would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for both con edison and cecony by approximately million and million  respectively  in pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by con edison to which cecony  o r and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees 
pension accounting by the utilities includes an allocation of plan assets 
the companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible  and for the utilities  to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate agreements 
the companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in under funding regulations and tax laws 
however  cecony  o r and con edison s competitive energy businesses made discretionary contributions to the plan in of million  million and million  respectively  and expect to make discretionary contributions in for ceconyand o r of million and million  respectively 
see expected contributions in notes e and f to the financial statements in item accounting for contingencies the accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition  situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
known material contingencies  which are described in the notes to the financial statements  include the utilities responsibility for hazardous substances  such as asbestos  pcbs and coal 
table of contents tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations note g  certain tax matters notes j and l  and other contingencies note h 
in accordance with the accounting rules  the companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated 
the utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits  workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans 
changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings 
accounting for long lived assets the accounting rules for property  plant and equipment require that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
under the accounting rules an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows  and exceeds its fair value  which approximates market value 
accounting for goodwill in accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and other intangibles  con edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually 
see note k to the financial statements in item goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill was million at december  the most recent test  which was performed during the first quarter of  did not require any second step assessment and did not result in any impairment 
the company s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values 
the company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies 
accounting for derivative instruments the companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments 
the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities 
the utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments 
see financial and commodity market risks  below and note o to the financial statements in item where the companies are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules  the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions  and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction 
substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources 
accounting for leases the companies apply the accounting rules for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions 
see note j to the financial statements in item for information about con edison development s lease in lease out or lilo transactions  a disallowance of tax losses by the irs and a favorable court decision in the company s litigation with the irs 
in accordance with the accounting rules  
table of contents con edison accounted for the two lilo transactions as leveraged leases 
accordingly  the company s investment in these leases  net of non recourse debt  is carried as a single amount in con edison s consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive  based upon the after tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases 
liquidity and capital resources the companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below 
the principal factors affecting con edison s liquidity are its investments in the utilities  the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below 
the principal factors affecting cecony s liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities  cash used in investing activities including construction expenditures  the dividends it pays to con edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below 
the companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements 
the companies repay their short term borrowings using funds from long term financings and operating activities 
the utilities cost of capital  including working capital  is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers 
each of the companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short term and long term cash requirements 
see the companies require access to capital market to satisfy funding requirements and the companies also face other risks that are beyond their control in item a  application of critical accounting policies accounting for contingencies  above  and utility regulation in item changes in the companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and are summarized as follows con edison millions of dollars variance vs

operating activities investing activities financing activities net change balance at beginning of period balance at end of period 
table of contents cash flows from operating activities the utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations 
the volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the utilities  such as growth of customer demand  weather  market prices for energy  economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency 
under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in cecony s electric and gas rate plans and o r s new york electric and gas rate plans  changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income 
see note b to the financial statements in item the prices at which the utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate agreements 
in general  changes in the utilities cost of purchased power  fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements 
see recoverable energy costs in note a to the financial statements in item net income is the result of cash and non cash or accrual transactions 
only cash transactions affect the companies cash flows from operating activities 
principal non cash charges include depreciation and deferred income tax expense 
principal non cash credits include amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities  net derivative losses and the pre tax gain on the sale of con edison development s ownership interests in electricity generating plants 
non cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in cecony s current electric and gas rate plans and o r s new york electric and gas rate plans 
see rate agreements cecony electric and o r electric in note b to the financial statements in item in march  cecony adopted unbilled revenue accounting which had the non cash effect of increasing an accrued unbilled revenue receivable  within other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet  and regulatory liabilities 
see note a to the financial statements in item in september  the companies applied million of a million deposit paid to the irs in to pay tax liabilities  and related interest  with respect to the timing of deductions of certain construction related costs 
see note l to the financial statements in item net cash flows from operating activities in for con edison and cecony were  million and  million higher  respectively  than in the period 
the increases in net cash flows reflect the january semi annual payment and july annual payment of cecony s new york city property taxes  compared with a semi annual payment in july the company achieved a percent reduction in its new york city property taxes for the fiscal year ending june  by prepaying the annual tax amount in july the increase is offset by the effect of changes in commodity prices on cash collateral requirements under the companies derivative instruments 
for con edison  the increase also reflects the payment of income taxes on the gain on the sale of con edison development s ownership interests in electricity generating plants 
net cash flows from operating activities in for con edison and cecony were million and million lower  respectively  than in the period 
the decreases reflect primarily the july prepayment  by cecony  of its annual new york city property taxes in the amount of million 
by prepaying this annual amount as opposed to paying in semi annual installments  cecony received a percent reduction in its new york city property taxes 
con edison s decrease also reflects the payment of income taxes  which includes the taxes on the gain on the sale of con edison development s ownership interests in electricity generating plants 
the decreases also reflect higher cash collateral paid due to lower commodity prices associated with the companies derivative transactions 
con edison and cecony s decrease is offset by lower rate case amortizations and the reconciliation of net t d in when compared with the change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs 
this timing issue is reflected within changes to accounts receivable customers  recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances 

table of contents the changes in regulatory assets principally reflects changes in deferred pension costs in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits and changes in future federal income taxes associated with increased removal costs 
see notes a  b and e to the financial statements in item cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities for con edison were  million higher in compared with the period 
the increase reflects primarily the absence of  in  proceeds from the sale of con edison development s ownership interests in electricity generating plants in  offset in part by decreased construction expenditures in net cash flows used in investing activities for cecony were million lower in compared with the period reflecting primarily decreased construction expenditures and the repayment of loans by o r

the most significant market risks include interest rate risk  commodity price risk  credit risk and investment risk 
interest rate risk the interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including the construction expenditures of the utilities and maturing debt securities 
con edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt 
con edison and cecony estimate that at december   a percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would not result in a material change in annual interest expense 
under cecony s current electric rate plan and o r s current new york gas rate plan  variations to long term debt costs are reconciled to levels reflected in rates 
under cecony s current steam rate plan and o r s current new york electric rate plan  variations in variable tax exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to the level set in rates 
in addition  from time to time  con edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities 
see interest rate swaps in note o to the financial statements in item commodity price risk con edison s commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity  gas and related derivative instruments 
the utilities and con edison s competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures 
see note o to the financial statements in item con edison estimates that  as of december   a percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of million for the derivative instruments used by the utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas  of which million is for cecony and million is for o r 
con edison expects that any such change in fair value would be 
table of contents largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased 
in accordance with provisions approved by state regulators  the utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers  including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs 
see recoverable energy costs in note a to the financial statements in item con edison s competitive energy businesses use a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments  physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments 
var represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
these businesses estimate var across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance covariance model with a percent confidence level 
since the var calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience  it is not necessarily indicative of future results 
var for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts  assuming a one day holding period  for the years ended december   and  respectively  was as follows millions of dollars confidence level  one day holding period average for the period high low credit risk the companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the utilities and the competitive energy businesses 
credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty s nonperformance 
the companies use credit policies to manage this risk  including an established credit approval process  monitoring of counterparty limits  netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements  credit insurance and credit default swaps 
the companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff 
the utilities had million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities  net of collateral  at december   of which million was with investment grade counterparties and million was with commodity exchange brokers 
con edison s competitive energy businesses had million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities  net of collateral  at december   of which million was with investment grade counterparties and million was with commodity exchange brokers or independent system operators 
investment risk the companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  above 
the companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of percent equities and percent fixed income and other securities 
at december   the pension plan investments consisted of percent equity and percent fixed income and other securities

table of contents impact of inflation the companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation 
regulation permits the utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs 
the impact is  however  partially offset by the repayment of the companies long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed

in general  the utilities recover on a current basis the fuel  gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers see recoverable energy costs in note a and regulatory matters in note b to the financial statements in item 
accordingly  such costs do not generally affect the companies results of operations 
management uses the term net revenues operating revenues less such costs to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the companies results of operations 
management believes that  although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the companies results of operations
