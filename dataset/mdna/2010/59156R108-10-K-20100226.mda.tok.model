the following discussion includes references to our performance measures operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders  that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and  consistent with gaap accounting guidance for segment reporting  is our measure of segment performance 
operating earnings is also a measure by which our senior management s and many other employees performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans 
operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses  net of income tax 
operating earnings available to common shareholders  which is used to evaluate the performance of banking  corporate other  as well as metlife is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends 
operating revenues is defined as gaap revenues i less net investment gains losses  ii less amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains losses  iii plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments that are hedges of investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  iv plus income from discontinued real estate operations  and v plus  for operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting  the aforementioned adjustments and those identified in the definition of operating expenses  net of income tax  if applicable to these joint ventures 
operating expenses is defined as gaap expenses i less changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value fluctuations  ii less costs related to business combinations since january  and noncontrolling interests  iii less amortization of dac and voba and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains losses  and iv plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our businesses 
operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders should not be viewed as substitutes for gaap income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax 
reconciliations of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders to gaap income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  the most directly comparable gaap measure  are included in consolidated results of operations 
executive summary metlife is a leading provider of insurance  employee benefits and financial services with operations throughout the united states and the latin america  asia pacific and europe  middle east and india emei regions 
through its subsidiaries  metlife offers life insurance  annuities  auto and homeowners insurance  retail banking and other financial services to individuals  as well as group insurance and retirement savings products and services to corporations and other institutions 
metlife is organized into five operating segments insurance products  retirement products  corporate benefit funding and auto home collectively  us business and international 
in addition  the company reports certain of its results of operations in banking  corporate other  which is comprised of metlife bank and other business activities 
the us and global financial markets experienced extraordinary dislocations during late through early  with the us economy entering a recession in january the economic crisis and the resulting recession have had an adverse effect on our financial results  as well as the financial services industry 
most economists believe the recession ended in the third quarter of when positive growth returned and now expect positive growth to continue through we have experienced an increase in market share and sales in some of our businesses from a flight to quality in the industry 
in addition  the recovering global financial markets contributed to the improvement in net investment income and sales in most of our international regions 
these positive impacts were outweighed by the adverse effects on our net investment income and the demand for certain of our products 

table of contents for a discussion of how the financial and economic environment has impacted our results  capital and liquidity  and expected performance  see results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and consolidated company outlook 
years ended december  in millions income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax less net investment gains losses less other adjustments to continuing operations less provision for income tax expense benefit operating earnings less preferred stock dividends operating earnings available to common shareholders year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unless otherwise stated  all amounts are net of income tax 
during the year ended december   metlife s income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  decreased billion to a loss of billion from income of billion in the comparable period 
the year over year change is predominantly due to a billion unfavorable change in net investment gains losses to losses of billion  net of related adjustments  in from gains of million  net of related adjustments  in in addition  operating earnings available to common shareholders decreased by million to billion in from billion in the unfavorable change in net investment gains losses of billion  net of related adjustments  was primarily driven by losses on freestanding derivatives  partially offset by gains on embedded derivatives  primarily associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees  and lower losses on fixed maturity securities 
the positive impacts of business growth and favorable mortality in several of our businesses were more than offset by a decline in net investment income  resulting in a decrease in operating earnings of million 
the decrease in net investment income caused significant declines in the operating earnings of many of our businesses  especially the interest spread businesses 
also contributing to the decline in operating earnings was an increase in net guaranteed annuity benefit costs and a charge related to our closed block of business  a specific group of participating life policies that were segregated in connection with the demutualization of mlic 
the favorable impact of operational excellence  our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative  was more than offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit costs  driving the increase in other expenses 
the declines in operating earnings were partially offset by a change in amortization related to dac  deferred sales inducement dsi  and unearned revenue 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unless otherwise stated  all amounts are net of income tax 
during the year ended december   metlife s income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  decreased million to billion from billion in the comparable period 
the year over year change was predominantly due to a billion decrease in operating earnings available to common shareholders 
partially offsetting this decline was a billion favorable change in net investment gains losses to gains of million  net of related adjustments  in from losses of million  net of related adjustments  in beginning in the third quarter of  there was unprecedented disruption and dislocation in the global financial markets that caused extreme volatility in the equity  credit and real estate markets 
this adversely impacted both net investment income as yields decreased and net investment gains losses as there was an increase in impairments and credit related losses 

table of contents we responded to the extraordinary market conditions by increasing levels of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and high quality  lower yielding fixed maturity securities particularly in two operating segments corporate benefit funding and retirement products  as well as in banking  corporate other 
we decreased fixed maturity security holdings to increase our liquidity position 
the favorable change of billion in net investment gains losses  net of related adjustments  was driven by increased gains on freestanding derivatives  partially offset by increased losses on embedded derivatives primarily associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees  and increased impairment losses on fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
the unprecedented disruption and dislocation in the global financial markets resulted in decreased yields on our investment portfolio and  in response to the market conditions  we increased our asset allocation to lower yielding  more liquid investments  both of which contributed to a decline in net investment income and  consequently  operating earnings available to common shareholders 
the market environment s negative impact on investment results was partially offset by growth in average invested assets calculated excluding unrealized gains and losses 
in addition  the volatile market environment also resulted in declines in our separate account balances 
such declines required us to increase dac amortization  negatively affecting operating earnings available to common shareholders 
the declines in the separate account balances also resulted in lower policy fees and other revenues 
operating earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended december  were also lower as a result of higher catastrophe losses and unfavorable mortality in various products 
higher earnings from our dental business and from our businesses in the latin america and asia pacific regions partially offset the aforementioned items 
consolidated company outlook in  the general economic conditions of the marketplace  particularly in the early part of the year  continued to be volatile and negatively impacted the results of the company 
in  we expect meaningful earnings recovery for the company  driven primarily by the following continued growth in premiums  fees other revenues we expect top line growth in of approximately over we expect this growth will be driven by higher fees earned on separate accounts  as the full impact of the recovery in the equity market is felt  thereby increasing the value of those separate accounts  increased sales in the pension closeout business  both in the united states and the united kingdom  as the demand for these products rebounds from the lower levels seen in  increases in our international segment  as a result of ongoing investments and improvements in the various distribution and service operations throughout the regions  and modest growth in insurance products 
our growth continues to be impacted by the current higher levels of unemployment and it is possible that certain customers may further reduce or eliminate coverages in response to the financial pressures they are experiencing 
offsetting these growth areas  metlife bank s premiums  fees other revenues are expected to decline from the level  which benefited from the large number of mortgage refinancings in that year 
higher returns on the investment portfolio despite expectations that the real estate market will remain challenging in  higher returns on the investment portfolio are expected across all segments 
we believe returns on alternative investment classes will improve and expect to reinvest cash and us treasuries into higher yielding asset classes 
improvement in net investment gains losses although difficult to predict  net investment gains losses on our invested asset portfolio are expected to show significant improvement as the financial markets stabilize across asset classes  returning to a more normalized level from the large losses encountered in more difficult to predict is the impact of 
table of contents potential changes in fair value of derivatives instruments as even relatively small movements in market variables  including interest rates  equity levels and volatility  can have a large impact on derivatives fair values 
additionally  changes in metlife s credit spread  may have a material impact on net investment gains losses as it is required to be included in the valuation of certain embedded derivatives 
reduced volatility in guarantee related liabilities certain annuity and life benefit guarantees are tied to market performance  which when markets are depressed  may require us to establish additional liabilities  even though these guarantees are significantly hedged 
in line with the assumptions discussed above  we expect a significant reduction in the volatility of these items in compared to focus on disciplined underwriting we do not expect any significant changes to the underlying trends that drive underwriting results and we anticipate solid results in while we did begin to see the negative impact of the economy on non medical health experience in  we expect to see improvement in our results in as the economy continues to improve 
pricing actions taken in in our dental business will help mitigate the impact of elevated claim utilization  experienced as a result of the challenging economic conditions and higher unemployment 
focus on expense management our continued focus on expense control throughout the company  as well the continuing impact of specific initiatives such as operational excellence our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative  should contribute to increased profitability 
with continued improvement in the financial markets  we also expect that the company s pension related expenses will return to a more normal level in industry trends the company s segments continue to be influenced by a continuing unstable financial and economic environment that affects the industry 
financial and economic environment 
our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy  generally  both in the united states and elsewhere around the world 
the global economy and markets are now recovering from a period of significant stress that began in the second half of and substantially increased through the first quarter of this disruption adversely affected the financial services industry  in particular 
the us economy entered a recession in january and most economists believe this recession ended in the third quarter of when positive growth returned 
most economists now expect positive growth to continue through throughout and continuing in  congress  the federal reserve bank of new york  the us treasury and other agencies of the federal government took a number of increasingly aggressive actions in addition to continuing a series of interest rate reductions that began in the second half of intended to provide liquidity to financial institutions and markets  to avert a loss of investor confidence in particular troubled institutions  to prevent or contain the spread of the financial crisis and to spur economic growth 
how and to whom these governmental institutions distribute amounts available under the governmental programs could have the effect of supporting some aspects of the financial services industry more than others or provide advantages to some of our competitors 
governments in many of the foreign markets in which metlife operates have also responded to address market imbalances and have taken meaningful steps intended to restore market confidence 
as market conditions have stabilized  some of these programs have been terminated or allowed to expire 
we cannot predict whether or when the us or foreign governments will establish additional governmental programs or terminate or permit other programs to expire or the impact any additional measures  existing programs or termination or expiration of programs will have on the financial markets  whether on the levels of volatility currently being experienced  the levels of lending by financial institutions  the prices buyers are willing to pay for financial assets or otherwise 
see business regulation governmental responses to extraordinary market conditions 
the economic crisis and the resulting recession have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of companies in the financial services industry  including metlife 
the declining financial markets and economic conditions have negatively impacted our investment income  our net investment gains losses  and

demographics 
in the coming decade  a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will be the rising income protection  wealth accumulation and needs of the retiring baby boomers 
as a result of increasing longevity  retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to finance retirements that may span or more years 
helping the baby boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income represents an opportunity for the life insurance industry 
life insurers are well positioned to address the baby boomers rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for income protection 
we believe that  among life insurers  those with strong brands  high financial strength ratings and broad distribution  are best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity to offer income protection products to baby boomers 
moreover  the life insurance industry s products and the needs they are designed to address are complex 
we believe that individuals approaching retirement age will need to seek information to plan for and manage their retirements and that  in the workplace  as employees take greater responsibility for their benefit options and retirement planning  they will need information about their possible individual needs 
one of the challenges for the life insurance industry will be the delivery of this information in a cost effective manner 
competitive pressures 
the life insurance industry remains highly competitive 
the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments  leading to more intense competition with respect to product features 
larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity  product development  technology and risk management  which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition 
sufficient scale  financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry 
larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base 
we believe that the turbulence in financial markets that began in the latter half of  its impact on the capital position of many competitors  and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator from the perspective of customers and certain distributors 
in addition  the financial market turbulence and the economic recession have led many companies in our industry to re examine the pricing and features of the products they offer and may lead to consolidation in the life insurance industry 
regulatory changes 
the life insurance industry is regulated at the state level  with some products and services also subject to federal regulation 
as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products  regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry 
regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry 
in addition  regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products  including equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and group products 
the regulation of the financial services industry has received renewed scrutiny as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets in and significant regulatory reforms have been proposed and these or other reforms could be implemented 
we cannot predict whether any such reforms will be adopted  the form they will take or their effect upon us 
we also cannot predict how the various government responses to the recent financial and economic difficulties will affect the financial services and insurance industries or the standing of particular companies  including our company  within those industries 
see risk factors our insurance and banking businesses are heavily regulated  and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth and risk factors changes in us federal and state securities laws and regulations may affect our operations and our profitability 
pension plans 
on august   president bush signed the pension protection act of ppa into law 
the ppa is a comprehensive reform of defined benefit and defined contribution plan rules 
the provisions of the ppa may  over time  have a significant impact on demand for pension  retirement savings  and lifestyle protection products in both the institutional and retail markets 
while the impact of the ppa is generally expected to be positive over time  these changes may have adverse short term effects on our business as plan sponsors may react to these changes in a variety of ways as the new rules and related regulations begin to take effect 
in response to the current financial and economic 
table of contents environment  president bush signed into the law the worker  retiree and employer recovery act the employer recovery act in december this act is intended to  among other things  ease the transition of certain funding requirements of the ppa for defined benefit plans 
in addition  legislation that would provide further relief for defined benefit plans is under consideration 
the financial and economic environment and the enactment of the employer recovery act  as well as additional funding relief provisions that may be enacted into law  may delay the timing or change the nature of qualified plan sponsor actions and  in turn  affect our business 
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i the estimated fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values  ii investment impairments  iii the recognition of income on certain investment entities and the application of the consolidation rules to certain investments  iv the estimated fair value of and accounting for freestanding derivatives and the existence and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  v the capitalization and amortization of dac and the establishment and amortization of voba  vi the measurement of goodwill and related impairment  if any  vii the liability for future policyholder benefits and the accounting for reinsurance contracts  viii accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets  ix accounting for employee benefit plans  and x the liability for litigation and regulatory matters 
in applying the company s accounting policies  we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
fair value the company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
in many cases  the exit price and the transaction or entry price will be the same at initial recognition 
however  in certain cases  the transaction price may not represent fair value 
the fair value of a liability is based on the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability to a third party with the same credit standing 
it requires that fair value be a market based measurement in which the fair value is determined based on a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant 
when quoted prices are not used to determine fair value  the company considers three broad valuation techniques i the market approach  ii the income approach  and iii the cost approach 
the company determines the most appropriate valuation technique to use  given what is being measured and the availability of sufficient inputs 
the company prioritizes the inputs to fair valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available 
the company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three level hierarchy  based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
an asset or 
table of contents liability s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input to its valuation 
the input levels are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
the company defines active markets based on average trading volume for equity securities 
the size of the bid ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed maturity securities 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in level  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other significant inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets or liabilities 
unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of estimated fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
prior to january   the measurement and disclosures of fair value based on exit price excluded certain items such as nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at estimated fair value in a business combination  reporting units measured at estimated fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test and indefinite lived intangible assets measured at estimated fair value for impairment assessment 
estimated fair value of investments the company s investments in fixed maturity and equity securities  investments in trading securities  certain short term investments  most mortgage loans held for sale  and mortgage servicing rights msrs are reported at their estimated fair value 
in determining the estimated fair value of these investments  various methodologies  assumptions and inputs are utilized  as described further below 
when available  the estimated fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable 
generally  these are the most liquid of the company s securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management judgment 
when quoted prices in active markets are not available  the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or other similar techniques 
the inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated fair values are based on available market information and management s judgments about financial instruments 
the significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 
when observable inputs are not available  the market standard valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value of certain types of securities that trade infrequently  and therefore have little or no price transparency  rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
these unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or estimation  and cannot be supported by reference to market activity 

table of contents even though unobservable  these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities 
the estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale are determined based on observable pricing of residential mortgage loans held for sale with similar characteristics  or observable pricing for securities backed by similar types of loans  adjusted to convert the securities prices to loan prices 
generally  quoted market prices are not available 
when observable pricing for similar loans or securities that are backed by similar loans are not available  the estimated fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are determined using independent broker quotations  which is intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from third parties 
certain other mortgage loans have also been designated as held for sale which are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs determined on an individual loan basis 
for these loans  estimated fair value is determined using independent broker quotations or  when the loan is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral estimated using internal models 
msrs  which are recorded in other invested assets  are measured at estimated fair value and are either acquired or are generated from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans where the servicing rights are retained by the company 
the estimated fair value of msrs is principally determined through the use of internal discounted cash flow models which utilize various assumptions as to discount rates  loan prepayments  and servicing costs 
the use of different valuation assumptions and inputs  as well as assumptions relating to the collection of expected cash flows may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of msrs 
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity 
the company s ability to sell securities  or the price ultimately realized for these securities  depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities 
investment impairments one of the significant estimates related to available for sale securities is the evaluation of investments for impairments 
as described more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  effective april   the company adopted new other than temporary impairments guidance that amends the methodology for determining for fixed maturity securities whether an other than temporary impairment exists  and for certain fixed maturity securities  changes how the amount of the other than temporary loss that is charged to earnings is determined 
there was no change in the other than temporary impairment otti methodology for equity securities 
the discussion presented below incorporates the new otti guidance adopted april  the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on our case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value 
the company s review of its fixed maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities i securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than  ii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and iii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
an extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments and the company s evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected 
in contrast  for certain equity securities  greater weight and consideration are given by the company to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover 
additionally  we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the 
table of contents issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi with respect to fixed maturity securities  whether the company has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell a particular security before recovery of the decline in estimated fair value below cost or amortized cost  vii with respect to equity securities  whether the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost  viii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage backed and asset backed securities  and ix other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
the cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for the credit loss component of otti in the period in which the determination is made 
when an otti of a fixed maturity security has occurred  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the fixed maturity security meets either of these two criteria  the otti recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its estimated fair value at the impairment measurement date 
for other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities that do not meet either of these two criteria  the net amount recognized in earnings is equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security and the present value of projected future cash flows to be collected from this security 
any difference between the estimated fair value and the present value of the expected future cash flows of the security at the impairment measurement date is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
for equity securities  the carrying value of the equity security is impaired to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
the company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value 
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
recognition of income on certain investment entities the recognition of income on certain investments eg loan backed securities  including mortgage backed and asset backed securities  certain structured investment transactions  trading securities  etc 
is dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned 
application of the consolidation rules to certain investments the company has invested in certain structured transactions that are variable interest entities vies 
these structured transactions include reinsurance trusts  asset backed securitizations  hybrid securities  joint ventures  limited partnerships and limited liability companies 
the company is required to consolidate those vies for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
the accounting rules for the determination of when an entity is a vie and when to consolidate a vie are complex 
the determination of the vie s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation 
table of contents of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each party involved in the entity  an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party involved in the entity 
the primary beneficiary is defined as the entity that will absorb a majority of a vie s expected losses  receive a majority of a vie s expected residual returns if no single entity absorbs a majority of expected losses  or both 
when assessing the expected losses to determine the primary beneficiary for structured investment products such as asset backed securitizations and collateralized debt obligations  the company uses historical default probabilities based on the credit rating of each issuer and other inputs including maturity dates  industry classifications and geographic location 
using computational algorithms  the analysis simulates default scenarios resulting in a range of expected losses and the probability associated with each occurrence 
for other investment structures such as hybrid securities  joint ventures  limited partnerships and limited liability companies  the company takes into consideration the design of the vie and generally uses a qualitative approach to determine if it is the primary beneficiary 
this approach includes an analysis of all contractual and implied rights and obligations held by all parties including profit and loss allocations  repayment or residual value guarantees  put and call options and other derivative instruments 
if the primary beneficiary of a vie can not be identified using this qualitative approach  the company calculates the expected losses and expected residual returns of the vie using a probability weighted cash flow model 
the use of different methodologies  assumptions and inputs in the determination of the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions including swaps  forwards  futures and option contracts to manage various risks relating to its ongoing business operations 
to a lesser extent  the company uses credit derivatives  such as credit default swaps  to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash market 
the estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices for exchange traded derivatives and financial forwards to sell certain to be announced securities or through the use of pricing models for over the counter derivatives 
the determination of estimated fair value  when quoted market values are not available  is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to be consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments 
derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  credit spreads  default risk including the counterparties to the contract  volatility  liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on significant inputs into the over the counter derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment 
the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the primary accounting guidance continue to evolve in practice 
judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment under such accounting guidance 
if it was determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied  reported net income could be materially affected 
differences in judgment as to the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company from that previously reported 
assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income 
embedded derivatives the company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits 
these include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb  guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  and certain guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib 
gmwb  gmab and certain gmib are embedded derivatives  which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product  with changes in estimated fair value reported in net investment gains losses 

table of contents the estimated fair values for these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees 
the projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
a risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk free rates 
beginning in  the valuation of these embedded derivatives includes an adjustment for the company s own credit and risk margins for non capital market inputs 
the company s own credit adjustment is determined taking into consideration publicly available information relating to the company s debt  as well as its claims paying ability 
risk margins are established to capture the non capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization  premium persistency  partial withdrawal and surrenders 
the establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment 
these guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets 
market conditions including  but not limited to  changes in interest rates  equity indices  market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the company s own credit standing  and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior  and risk margins related to non capital market inputs may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income 
the company ceded the risk associated with certain of the gmib and gmab described in the preceding paragraphs 
the value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the company 
the estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is determined using market standard swap valuation models and observable market inputs  including an adjustment for the company s own credit that takes into consideration publicly available information relating to the company s debt  as well as its claims paying ability 
changes in equity and bond indices  interest rates and the company s credit standing may result in significant fluctuations in estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income 
the accounting for embedded derivatives is complex and interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
if interpretations change  there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income 
deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
costs that vary with and relate to the production of new business are deferred as dac 
such costs consist principally of commissions and agency and policy issuance expenses 
voba is an intangible asset that represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired insurance annuity and investment type contracts 
voba is based on actuarially determined projections  by each block of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  operating expenses  investment returns and other factors 
actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections 
the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
dac and voba are aggregated in the financial statements for reporting purposes 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s accounting policy relating to dac and voba amortization for various types of contracts 
separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in force account balances on such contracts each reporting period which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of dac and voba 
the company s practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short term market fluctuations  but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected 
the company monitors these changes and only changes the assumption when its long term expectation changes 
the effect of an increase 
table of contents decrease by basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease increase in the dac and voba amortization of approximately million with an offset to the company s unearned revenue liability of approximately million for this factor 
the company also reviews periodically other long term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits 
these include investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  interest crediting rates  mortality  persistency  and expenses to administer business 
we annually update assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed 
if the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase  dac and voba amortization will decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease 
over the last several years  the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of dac and voba have been updated due to revisions to expected future investment returns  expenses  in force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on contracts included within the insurance products and retirement products segments 
during  the amount of net investment gains losses  as well as the level of separate account balances also resulted in significant changes to expected future gross margins and profits impacting amortization of dac and voba 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the company is unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a rollforward of dac and voba for the company for each of the years ended december   and  as well as a breakdown of dac and voba by segment and reporting unit at december  and at december  and  dac and voba for the company was billion and billion  respectively 
a substantial portion  approximately  of the company s dac and voba was associated with the insurance products and retirement products segments at december  at december  and  dac and voba for these segments was billion and billion  respectively 
amortization of dac and voba associated with the variable universal life and the annuities contracts within the insurance products and retirement products segments are significantly impacted by movements in equity markets 
the following chart illustrates the effect on dac and voba within the company s us business of changing each of the respective assumptions  as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended december   and increases decreases in dac and voba balances  as presented below  result in a corresponding decrease increase in amortization 
years ended december  in millions investment return separate account balances net investment gain loss related expense in force persistency policyholder dividends and other total prior to  fluctuations in the amounts presented in the table above arose principally from normal assumption reviews during the period 

table of contents the following represents significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in actual gross profits decreased as a result of increased investment losses from the portfolios associated with the hedging of guaranteed insurance obligations on variable annuities  resulting in a decrease of dac and voba amortization of million 
changes in net investment gains losses resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization actual gross profits increased as a result of a decrease in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities  resulting in an increase of dac and voba amortization of million  excluding the impact from the company s own credit and risk margins  which are described below 
this increase in actual gross profits was partially offset by freestanding derivative losses associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations  which resulted in a decrease in dac and voba amortization of million 
the narrowing of the company s own credit spreads increased the valuation of guarantee liabilities  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
this was partially offset by lower risk margins which decreased the guarantee liability valuations  increased actual gross profits and increased dac and voba amortization by million 
the remainder of the impact of net investment gains losses  which decreased dac amortization by million  was primarily attributable to current period investment activities 
included in policyholder dividends and other was a decrease in amortization of million as a result of changes to long term assumptions 
the remainder of the decrease was due to various immaterial items 
the following represent significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in the decrease in equity markets during the year significantly lowered separate account balances which lead to a significant reduction in expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in an increase of million in dac and voba amortization 
changes in net investment gains losses resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities resulting in a reduction of dac and voba amortization of  million 
this decrease in actual gross profits was mitigated by freestanding derivative gains associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations which resulted in an increase in actual gross profits and an increase in dac and voba amortization of million 
the widening of the company s own credit spreads decreased the valuation of guarantee liabilities  increased actual gross profits and increased dac and voba amortization by million 
this was partially offset by higher risk margins which increased the guarantee liability valuations  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
reductions in both actual and expected cumulative earnings of the closed block resulting from recent experience in the closed block combined with changes in expected dividend scales resulted in an increase in closed block dac amortization of million  million of which was related to net investment gains losses 
the remainder of the impact of net investment gains losses  which increased dac amortization by million  was attributable to numerous immaterial items 
increases in amortization in resulting from changes in assumptions related to in force persistency of million were driven by higher than anticipated mortality and lower than anticipated premium persistency during the company s dac and voba balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains losses and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been recognized 
the significant decrease in unrealized investment losses decreased the dac and voba balance by billion in 
table of contents whereas increases in unrealized investment losses increased the dac and voba balance by billion in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements include the dac and voba offset to unrealized investment losses 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the second quarter 
impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach  which requires the use of estimates and judgment  at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment  if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  a significant portion of goodwill within banking  corporate other is allocated to reporting units within our business segments 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  there might be an indication of impairment 
in such instances  the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill would be determined in a business acquisition 
the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income 
in performing our goodwill impairment tests  when we believe meaningful comparable market data are available  the estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a market multiple approach 
when relevant comparables are not available  we use a discounted cash flow model 
for reporting units which are particularly sensitive to market assumptions  such as the retirement products and individual life reporting units  we may corroborate our estimated fair values by using additional valuation methodologies 
the key inputs  judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value include projected operating earnings  current book value with and without accumulated other comprehensive income  the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business  long term growth rates  comparative market multiples  the account value of in force business  projections of new and renewal business  as well as margins on such business  the level of interest rates  credit spreads  equity market levels  and the discount rate we believe appropriate to the risk associated with the respective reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of the retirement products and individual life reporting units are particularly sensitive to the equity market levels 
when testing goodwill for impairment  we also consider our market capitalization in relation to our book value 
we believe that our current market capitalization supports the value of the underlying reporting units 
we apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the estimated fair value of our reporting units and their book value 
the valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change 
estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
during our impairment tests of goodwill  we concluded that the fair values of all reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
however  we continue to evaluate current market conditions that may affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists 
deteriorating or adverse market conditions for certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result in future impairments of goodwill 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further consideration of goodwill impairment testing during 
table of contents liability for future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  traditional annuities and non medical health insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  disability incidence  disability terminations  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumptions  additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations  expenses and interest 
liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
other policyholder funds include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on life and non medical health insurance 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and secondary and paid up guarantees relating to certain life policies are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
the assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing dac  and are thus subject to the same variability and risk 
the assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical s p experience 
the company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing of these policies and guarantees and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products issued by third parties 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance agreements  the company determines if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company reviews all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the 
table of contents company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the agreement using the deposit method of accounting 
income taxes income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with its operations 
the company provides for federal  state and foreign income taxes currently payable  as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines  based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
factors in management s determination consider the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains 
significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established  as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in the financial statements 
a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
the company may be required to change its provision for income taxes when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is challenged by taxing authorities or when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change  or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances 
additionally  future events  such as changes in tax laws  tax regulations  or interpretations of such laws or regulations  could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate 
any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 
employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of the holding company the subsidiaries sponsor and or administer pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the obligations and expenses associated with these plans require an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  healthcare cost trend rates  as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements  withdrawal rates and mortality 
in consultation with our external consulting actuarial firm  we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical performance of the plan and its assets  currently available market and industry data  and expected benefit payout streams 
the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to  among other factors  changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 

table of contents litigation contingencies the company is a party to a number of legal actions and is involved in a number of regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on the company s financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims  the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed  the possible impact of tort reform efforts  the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the company when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known  and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis  the company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
economic capital economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
as a part of the economic capital process  a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk based capital rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the company s businesses 
acquisitions and dispositions see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recent developments on february   metlife announced that it is in discussions with american international group  inc about acquiring its subsidiary  american life insurance company  an international life insurance company 
these discussions are ongoing 
no agreement has been reached and there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unfavorable market conditions continued through  providing a challenging business environment 
the largest and most significant impact continued to be on our investment portfolio as declining yields resulted in lower net investment income 
market sensitive expenses were also negatively impacted by the market conditions as evidenced by an increase in pension and postretirement benefit costs 
higher levels of unemployment continued to impact certain group businesses as a decrease in covered payrolls reduced growth 
our auto and homeowners business was impacted by a declining housing market  the deterioration of the new auto sales market and the continuation of credit availability issues  all of which contributed to a decrease in insured exposures 
despite the challenging business environment  revenue growth remained solid in the majority of our businesses 
a flight to quality during the year contributed to an improvement in sales in both our domestic fixed and variable annuity products 
we also saw an increase in market share  especially in the structured settlement business  where we experienced an increase of in premiums 
an improvement in the global financial markets contributed to a recovery of sales in most of our international regions and resulted in improved investment performance in some 
table of contents regions during the second half of we also benefited domestically from a strong residential mortgage refinance market and healthy growth in the reverse mortgage arena

during the year ended december   metlife s income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax decreased billion to a loss of billion from income of billion in the comparable period 
the year over year change is predominantly due to a billion unfavorable change in net investment gains losses to losses of billion  net of related adjustments  in from gains of million  net of related adjustments  in 
table of contents we manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset liability management principles  focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities 
our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount  while optimizing  net of income tax  risk adjusted net investment income and risk adjusted total return 
our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments  with over of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 
these securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities 
other invested asset classes including  but not limited to equity securities  other limited partnership interests and real estate and real estate joint ventures provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement in addition to supporting the cash flow and duration objectives of our investment portfolio 
we also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currencies  credit spreads and equity market levels 
additional considerations for our investment portfolio include current and expected market conditions and expectations for changes within our unique mix of products and business segments 
the composition of the investment portfolio of each business segment is tailored to the unique characteristics of its insurance liabilities  causing certain portfolios to be shorter in duration and others to be longer in duration 
accordingly  certain portfolios are more heavily weighted in fixed maturity securities  or certain sub sectors of fixed maturity securities  than other portfolios 
investments are purchased to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses 
however  net investment gains and losses are generated and can change significantly from period to period  due to changes in external influences including movements in interest rates  foreign currencies and credit spreads  counterparty specific factors such as financial performance  credit rating and collateral valuation  and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing that can generate gains and losses 
as an investor in the fixed income  equity security  mortgage loan and certain other invested asset classes  we are exposed to the above stated risks  which can lead to both impairments and credit related losses 
the unfavorable variance in net investment gains losses of billion  net of related adjustments  was primarily driven by losses on freestanding derivatives  partially offset by gains on embedded derivatives associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees  and decreased losses on fixed maturity securities 
the negative change in freestanding derivatives  from gains in the prior year to losses in the current year  was primarily attributable to the effect of rising interest rates on certain interest rate sensitive derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities  weakening us dollar on certain foreign currency sensitive derivatives  and equity market and interest rate derivatives that are economic hedges of embedded derivatives 
losses on embedded derivatives decreased from losses to gains and were driven primarily by rising interest rates and improving equity market performance 
the gains were net of losses attributable to a narrowing of the company s own credit spread 
losses on the freestanding derivatives hedging these embedded derivatives risks substantially offset the change in the liabilities attributable to market factors  excluding the adjustment for the change in the company s own credit spread  which is not hedged 
the decrease in losses on fixed maturity securities is primarily attributable to lower net losses on sales of fixed maturity securities  partially offset by increased impairments due to the current financial market conditions  although this trend lessened in the latter part of as more fully described in the discussion of performance measures above  operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate performance and allocate resources 
consistent with gaap accounting guidance for segment reporting  it is our measure of performance  as reported below 
operating earnings is not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax 
we believe that the presentation of operating earnings enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business

the markets also positively impacted our operating earnings available to common shareholders as conditions began to improve during  resulting in lower dac and dsi amortization 
a million decline in net investment income was the result of decreasing yields  including the effects of our higher quality  more liquid  but lower yielding investment position in response to the extraordinary market conditions 
the impact of declining yields caused a billion decrease in net investment income  which was partially offset by an increase of million due to growth in average invested assets calculated excluding unrealized gains and losses 
the decrease in yields resulted from the disruption and dislocation in the global financial markets experienced in  which continued  but moderated  in the adverse yield impact was concentrated in the following four invested asset classes fixed maturity securities primarily due to lower yields on floating rate securities from declines in short term interest rates and an increased allocation to lower yielding  higher quality  us treasury  agency and 
table of contents government guaranteed securities  to increase liquidity in response to the extraordinary market conditions  as well as decreased income on our securities lending program  primarily due to the smaller size of the program in the current year 
these adverse impacts were offset slightly as conditions improved late in and we began to reallocate our portfolio to higher yielding assets  real estate joint ventures primarily due to declining property valuations on certain investment funds that carry their real estate at estimated fair value and operating losses incurred on properties that were developed for sale by development joint ventures  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments primarily due to declines in short term interest rates  and mortgage loans primarily due to lower prepayments on commercial mortgage loans and lower yields on variable rate loans reflecting declines in short term interest rates 
equity markets experienced some recovery in  which led to improved yields on other limited partnership interests 
as many of our products are interest spread based  the lower net investment income was significantly offset by lower interest credited expense on our investment and insurance products 
the financial market conditions also resulted in a million increase in net guaranteed annuity benefit costs in our retirement products segment  as increased hedging losses were only partially offset by lower guaranteed benefit costs 
the key driver of the increase in other expenses stemmed from the impact of market conditions on certain expenses  primarily pension and postretirement benefit costs  reinsurance expenses and letter of credit fees 
these increases coupled with higher variable costs  such as commissions and premium taxes  some of which have been capitalized  more than offset the favorable impact of lower information technology  travel  professional services and advertising expenses  which include the impact of our operational excellence initiative 
the market improvement which began in the second quarter of was a key factor in the determination of our expected future gross profits  the increase of which triggered a decrease in dac and dsi amortization  most significantly in the retirement products segment 
the increase in our expected future gross profits stemmed primarily from an increase in the market value of our separate account balances  which is attributable  in part  to the improving financial markets 
our insurance products segment benefited  in the current year  from an increase in amortization of unearned revenue  primarily as a result of our annual review of assumptions that are used in the determination of the amount of amortization recognized 
these collective changes in amortization resulted in a million benefit  partially offsetting the declines in operating earnings available to common shareholders discussed above 
a portion of the decline in operating earnings available to common shareholders was caused by a million reduction in the results of our closed block of business  a specific group of participating life policies that were segregated in connection with the demutualization of mlic 
until early  the operating earnings of the closed block did not have a full impact on operating earnings as the operating earnings or loss was partially offset by a change in the policyholder dividend obligation  a liability established at the time of demutualization 
however  in early the policyholder dividend obligation was depleted and  as a result  the total operating earnings or loss related to the closed block for the year ended december  was  and in the future may be a component of operating earnings 
business growth  from the majority of our businesses  along with net favorable mortality experience  had a positive impact on operating earnings available to common shareholders 
these impacts were somewhat dampened by higher benefit utilization in our dental business and mixed claim activity in our auto home segment 
in addition  our forward and reverse residential mortgage platform acquisitions in late benefited banking  corporate other s results

this resulted in lower net investment income and an increase in market sensitive expenses  primarily pension and postretirement benefit costs 
we also experienced higher utilization of dental benefits along with a lower number of recoveries in our disability business 
higher levels of unemployment continued to impact certain group businesses as a decrease in covered payrolls reduced growth 
however  revenue growth remained solid in all of our businesses 
revenue growth in our dental and individual life businesses reflected strong sales and renewals 
the significant components of the million decline in operating earnings were the aforementioned decline in net investment income  especially in the closed block business  partially offset by an increase in the amortization of unearned revenue  the impact of a reduction in dividends to certain policyholders and favorable mortality in the individual life business 
until early  the earnings of the closed block did not have a full impact on operating earnings as the earnings or loss was partially offset by a change in the policyholder dividend obligation 
however  in early the policyholder dividend obligation was depleted and  as a result  the total operating earnings or loss related to the closed block for the year ended december  was  and in the future may be  a component of operating earnings 
this resulted in a million decline in operating earnings in the decrease in net investment income of million was primarily due to a million decrease from lower yields  partially offset by a million increase from growth in average invested assets 
yields were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global financial markets  which primarily impacted other invested assets  real estate joint ventures and fixed maturity securities 
in addition  income from our securities lending program decreased primarily due to the smaller size of the program in the growth in the average invested asset base was primarily from an increase in net flows from our individual life  non medical health  and group life businesses

table of contents including real estate joint ventures and other invested assets to provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement 
other expenses were essentially flat despite an increase of million from the impact of market conditions on certain expenses  primarily pension and postretirement benefit costs 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million  predominantly from declines in information technology  travel  and professional services  including the positive impact of our operational excellence initiative 
a further reduction of expenses was achieved through a decrease in variable expenses  such as commissions and premium taxes of million  a portion of which is offset by dac capitalization 
the aforementioned declines in operating earnings were partially offset by the favorable impact of a million decrease in policyholder dividends in the traditional life business  the result of a dividend scale reduction in the fourth quarter of in addition  favorable mortality in the individual life business was partially offset by higher benefit utilization in the dental business during  reflecting the negative employment trends in the marketplace 
the net impact of these two items benefited operating earnings by million 
the results were also favorably impacted by our review of assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and margins  which in turn are factors in determining the amortization for dac and unearned revenue 
this review resulted in an unlocking event related to unearned revenue and  coupled with the impact from the prior year s review  generated an increase in operating earnings of million 
this increase was recorded in universal life and investment type product policy fees 
partially offsetting these increases was the impact of lower separate account balances  which resulted in lower fee income of million 
dac amortization reflects lower current year amortization of million  stemming from the impact of the improvement in the financial markets in  which increased our expected future gross profits  as well as lower current year gross margins in the closed block

table of contents annuity sales have out paced the industry  increasing our market share 
fixed annuity sales benefited from enhanced marketing on our income annuity with life contingency products  which increased our premium revenues by million  or  before income taxes 
in the annuity business  the movement in premiums is almost entirely offset by the related change in policyholder benefits  as the insurance liability that we establish at the time we assume the risk under these contracts is typically equivalent to the premium earned less the amount of acquisition expenses 
our average policyholder account balances grew by billion in  primarily due to an increase in sales of fixed annuity products and more customers electing the fixed option on variable annuity sales 
this has a favorable impact on earnings by increasing net investment income  which is somewhat offset by higher interest credited expense 
unfavorable market conditions resulted in poor investment performance  which outweighed the impact of higher variable annuity sales on our separate account balances causing the average separate account balance to remain lower than the previous year 
this resulted in lower policy fees and other revenues which are based on daily asset balances in the policyholder separate accounts 
the improvement in the financial markets was the primary driver of the million increase in operating earnings  with the largest impact resulting in a decrease in dac  voba and dsi amortization of million 
the results reflected increased  or accelerated  amortization primarily stemming from a decline in the market value of our separate account balances 
a factor that determines the amount of amortization is expected future earnings  which in the annuity business are derived  in part  from fees earned on separate account balances 
the market value of our separate account balances declined significantly in  resulting in a decrease in the expected future gross profits  triggering an acceleration of amortization in beginning in the second quarter of  the market conditions began to improve and the market value of our separate account balances began to increase  resulting in an increase in the expected future gross profits and a corresponding lower level of amortization in also contributing to the increase in operating earnings was an increase in net investment income of million  which was primarily due to a million increase from growth in average invested assets  partially offset by a million decrease in yields 
the increase in average invested assets was due to increased cash flows from the sales of fixed annuity products and more customers electing the fixed option on variable annuity sales  which were reinvested primarily in fixed maturity securities  other invested assets and mortgage loans 
yields were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global financial markets which primarily impacted real estate joint ventures  fixed maturity securities and cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the moderate improvement in the equity markets in led to an increase in yields on other limited partnership interests and certain other invested assets  which partially offset the overall reduction in yields

as is typically the case with fixed annuity products  higher net investment income was somewhat offset by higher interest credited expense 
growth in our fixed annuity policyholder account balances increased interest credited expense by million in and higher average crediting rates on fixed annuities increased interest credited expense by million 
operating earnings were negatively impacted by million of operating losses related to the hedging programs for variable annuity minimum death and income benefit guarantees  which are not embedded derivatives  partially offset by a decrease in the liability established for these variable annuity guarantees 
the various hedging strategies in place to offset the risk associated with these variable annuity guarantee benefits were more sensitive to market movements than the liability for the guaranteed benefit 
market volatility  improvements in the equity markets  and higher interest rates produced operating losses on these hedging strategies in the current year 
our hedging strategies  which are a key part of our risk management  performed as anticipated 
the decrease in annuity guarantee benefit liabilities was due to the improvement in the equity markets  higher interest rates and the annual unlocking of future market expectations 
other expenses increased by million primarily due to an increase of million from the impact of market conditions on certain expenses 
these expenses are largely comprised of reinsurance costs  pension and postretirement benefit expenses  and letter of credit fees 
in addition  variable expenses  such as commissions and premium taxes  increased million  the majority of which have been offset by dac capitalization 
the positive 
table of contents impact of our operational excellence initiative was reflected in lower information technology  travel  professional services and advertising expenses  but was more than offset by increases largely due to business growth

our pension closeout business in the united kingdom continues to expand and experienced premium growth during of almost million  or before income taxes 
however  this growth was more than offset by a decline in our domestic pension closeout business driven by unfavorable market conditions and regulatory changes 
a combination of poor equity returns and lower interest rates have contributed to pension plans being under funded  which reduces our customers flexibility to engage in transactions such as pension closeouts 
our customers plans funded status may be affected by a variety of factors  including the ongoing phased implementation of the pensions protection act of for each of these businesses  the movement in premiums is almost entirely offset by the related change in policyholder benefits 
the insurance liability that is established at the time we assume the risk under these contracts is typically equivalent to the premium earned 
market conditions also contributed to a lower demand for several of our investment type products 
the decrease in sales of these investment type products is not necessarily evident in our results of operations as the transactions related to these products are recorded through the balance sheet 
our funding agreement products  primarily the london inter bank offer rate libor based contracts  experienced the most significant impact from the volatile market conditions 
as companies seek greater liquidity  investment managers are refraining from repurchasing the contracts when they mature and are opting for more liquid investments 
in addition  unfavorable market conditions continued to impact the demand for global guaranteed interest contracts  a type of funding agreement 
policyholder account balances for our investment type products were down by approximately billion during  as issuances were more than offset by scheduled maturities 
however  due to the timing of issuances 
table of contents and maturities  the average policyholder account balances and liabilities increased from to the impact of the decrease in policyholder account balances resulted in lower net investment income  which was somewhat offset by lower interest credited expense 
the primary driver of the million decrease in operating earnings was lower net investment income of million reflecting a million decrease from lower yields and a million increase due to growth in average invested assets 
yields were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global financial markets which impacted real estate joint ventures  fixed maturity securities  other invested assets and mortgage loans 
in addition  income from our securities lending program decreased  primarily due to the smaller size of the program during the year 
to manage the needs of our longer term liabilities  our portfolio consists primarily of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  us treasury  agency and government guaranteed securities and  to a lesser extent  certain other invested asset classes including real estate joint ventures in order to provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement 
for our shorter term obligations  we invest primarily in structured finance securities  mortgage loans and investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities 
the yields on these investments have moved consistent with the underlying market indices  primarily libor and treasury  on which they are based 
the growth in the average invested asset base is consistent with the increase in the average policyholder account balances and liabilities 
as many of our products are interest spread based  the lower net investment income was somewhat offset by lower net interest credited expense of million 
the decrease in interest credited expense is attributed to million from lower crediting rates 
crediting rates have moved consistent with the underlying market indices  primarily libor  on which they are based 
the increase in the average policyholder account balances resulted in a million increase in interest credited expense 
the year over year decline in operating earnings was also due in part to lower other revenues as the prior year benefited by million in fees for the cancellation of a bank owned life insurance stable value wrap policy combined with the surrender of a global guaranteed interest contract 
in addition  a refinement to a reinsurance recoverable in the small business record keeping line of business in the latter part of also contributed million to the decrease in operating earnings 
current year results benefited from favorable liability refinements as compared to unfavorable liability refinements in  as well as improved mortality experience in the current year  all in the pension closeouts business 
these items improved operating earnings by approximately million 
other products generated mortality gains or losses  however  the net change did not have a material impact on our year over year results 
although our other expenses only increased marginally and are not a significant driver of the decrease in operating earnings  the general themes associated with the increase are consistent with those factors discussed above in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations 
market conditions triggered an increase in our pension and postretirement benefit expenses of million 
in addition  variable expenses  such as commissions and premium taxes  have increased million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million  primarily in information technology  travel and professional services expenses  all of which were largely due to our operational excellence initiative

in particular  we experienced a large decrease in earned exposures in massachusetts  whose market was impacted by a regulatory change  which resulted in a marked increase in competition 
a return to more normal weather conditions in resulted in fewer  and less severe  catastrophe events than in this was more than offset by an increase in both non catastrophe claim frequencies and non catastrophe claim severities in mixed claim experience and the impact of lower exposures were the primary drivers of the million decrease in operating earnings 
while we had a million decrease in catastrophe related losses compared to the prior year  we also recorded million less of a benefit in from favorable development of prior year non catastrophe losses 
current year claim costs rose primarily as a result of a million increase in claim frequency from both our auto and homeowners products 
in addition  we had a million net increase in claim severity  stemming from higher severity in our auto line of business that was partially offset by lower severity in our homeowners line of business 
in  we experienced a decline in insured exposures  which contributed approximately million to the decrease in operating earnings 
while this decrease in exposures had a positive impact on the amount of claims  it was more than offset by the negative impact on premiums 
the decrease in exposures is largely attributable to slightly higher non renewal rates  partially offset by greater sales of new policies 
also contributing to the decline in earnings was a decrease of million in the average premium per policy  which is primarily due to a shift in earned exposures to lower average premium states and an increase of million in loss adjustment expenses  primarily related to a decrease in unallocated loss adjusting expense liabilities at the end of the impact of the items discussed above can be seen in the unfavorable change in the combined ratio  excluding catastrophes  to in from in and the unfavorable change in the combined ratio  including catastrophes  to in from in a million decrease in other expenses  including the net change in dac  partially offset the declines in operating earnings discussed above 
this improvement resulted from decreases in sales related expenses and from minor fluctuations in a number of expense categories  a portion of which is due to our operational excellence initiative

the reduction in operating earnings includes the adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in as the us dollar strengthened against the various foreign currencies 
this decreased operating earnings by million in relative to excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  operating earnings increased million  or  from the prior year 
this increase was primarily driven by higher operating earnings of million in our asia pacific region  while operating earnings from our latin america and emei regions decreased by million and million  respectively 
asia pacific region 
improving financial market conditions was the primary driver of the increase in operating earnings 
net investment income in the region increased by million due to an increase of million from improved yields on our investment portfolio  million from the change in results of operating joint ventures  and million from an increase in average invested assets 
the increase in yields was primarily due to higher income of million on the trading securities portfolio  stemming from equity markets experiencing some recovery in as our trading securities portfolio backs unit linked policyholder liabilities  this increase in income was entirely offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense 
the income of the japan joint venture improved by million due to favorable investment results and lower amortization of 
table of contents dac and voba 
the decrease in dac and voba amortization was primarily due to an increase in the market value of the joint venture s separate account balances  which is directly tied to the improving financial markets 
a factor that determines the amount of dac and voba amortization is expected future fees earned on separate account balances 
since the market value of separate account balances have increased  it is expected that future earnings on this block of business will be higher than previously anticipated 
as a result  the amortization of dac and voba was less in the current year 
operating earnings in this region also benefited from higher surrender charges of million 
difficult economic conditions in korea during the first half of the year resulted in a higher level of surrenders 
growth in our japan reinsurance business and an increase in reinsurance rates contributed million to the increase in operating earnings 
in addition  the favorable impact of a reduction in the liability for our variable annuity guarantees contributed million to operating earnings 
the change in the liability was primarily due to an increase in separate account balances in the japan joint venture 
these liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns 
the scenarios use best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize dac 
because separate account balances have had positive returns relative to the prior year  current estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously projected which resulted in a decrease in this liability in the current period 
partially offsetting these increases  higher dac amortization of million resulted from business growth and favorable investment results 
latin america region 
the decrease in operating earnings was primarily driven by lower net investment income 
net investment income decreased by million due to a decrease of million from lower yields  partially offset by an increase of million due to an increase in average invested assets 
the decrease in yields was due  in part  to the impact of changes in assumptions for measuring the effects of inflation on certain inflation indexed fixed maturity securities 
this decrease was partially offset by a reduction of million in the related insurance liability primarily due to lower inflation 
the increase in net investment income attributable to an increase in average invested assets was primarily due to business growth and  as such  was largely offset by increases in policyholder benefits and interest credited expense 
higher claim experience in mexico resulted in a million decline in operating earnings 
the nationalization and reform of the pension business in argentina impacted both the current year and prior year earnings  resulting in a net million decline in operating earnings 
in addition  operating earnings decreased due to a net income tax increase of million in mexico  resulting from a change in assumption regarding the repatriation of earnings  partially offset by the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate in partially offsetting these decreases in operating earnings was the combination of growth in mexico s individual and institutional businesses and higher premium rates in its institutional business  which increased operating earnings by million 
pesification in argentina impacted both the current year and prior year earnings  resulting in a net million increase in operating earnings 
this benefit was largely due to a reassessment of our approach in managing existing and potential future claims related to certain social security pension annuity contract holders in argentina resulting in a liability release 
lower expenses of million resulted primarily from the impact of operational efficiencies achieved through our operational excellence initiative 
emei region 
the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and a tax benefit  both of which occurred in the prior year  contributed million to the decline in operating earnings 
our investment of million in our distribution capability and growth initiatives in also reduced operating earnings

this adversely impacted net investment income as market yields decreased and portfolio yields decreased from an increased allocation to lower yielding  more liquid investments 
the adverse impact on net investment gains losses from increased impairments and credit related realized losses was more than offset by favorable market value changes in derivative instruments 
the increase in net investment gains of billion  net of related adjustments  was primarily driven by increased gains on freestanding derivatives  partially offset by increased losses on embedded derivatives primarily associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees  and increased impairment losses on fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
the increased gains on freestanding derivatives were from certain interest sensitive derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and liabilities  gains from foreign currency derivatives primarily due to the us dollar strengthening  and gains from equity and interest rate derivatives that are economic hedges of embedded derivatives 
losses on embedded derivatives increased and were driven by declining interest rates and poor equity market performance  and were net of gains attributable to a widening in the company s own credit spread 
the gains on freestanding derivatives hedging these embedded derivative risks substantially offset the change in the liabilities attributable to market factors  excluding the adjustment for the change in the company s own credit spread  which is not hedged 
the increased impairment losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were primarily associated with financial services industry holdings due to the stress in the global financial markets  as well as other credit related impairments due to the lack of intent to hold or uncertainty on intent to hold certain securities until recovery of market value declines

as many of our products are interest spread based  the lower net investment income was significantly offset by lower interest credited expense on our investment and insurance products 
in addition to its impact on net investment income  the volatile market environment also negatively impacted operating earnings through an increase in dac amortization  most significantly in the retirement products segment 
the acceleration of amortization stemmed primarily as a result of the decline in the market value of our separate account balances  which is directly tied to the financial markets 
lower separate account balances also resulted in a decrease in policy fees and other revenues 
unfavorable mortality experience in the group and individual life businesses and unfavorable claims experience in the non medical health and other business reduced operating earnings in our insurance products segment

the acceleration of amortization resulted primarily from the decline in the market value of our separate account balances  which is directly tied to the financial markets 
a factor that determines the amount of amortization is expected future earnings  which in this annuity business are derived  in part  from fees earned on separate account balances

effects of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 

table of contents inflation in the united states has remained contained and been in a general downtrend for an extended period 
however  in light of recent and ongoing aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures by the us federal government and foreign governments  it is possible that inflation could increase in the future 
an increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways 
during inflationary periods  the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses 
inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials  potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs can not be passed through in our product prices 
inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in our auto home business  which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation 
if actual inflation exceeds the expectations we use in pricing our policies  the profitability of our auto home business would be adversely affected 
prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally  and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy  which could constrain overall economic activity  inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities 
investments investment risks 
the company s primary investment objective is to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the company is exposed to four primary sources of investment risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest  interest rate risk  relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates  liquidity risk  relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions  and market valuation risk  relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads 
the company manages risk through in house fundamental analysis of the underlying obligors  issuers  transaction structures and real estate properties 
the company also manages credit risk  market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation 
for real estate and agricultural assets  the company manages credit risk and market valuation risk through geographic  property type and product type diversification and asset allocation 
the company manages interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management strategies  product design  such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  and proactive monitoring and management of certain non guaranteed elements of its products  such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments 
the company also uses certain derivative instruments in the management of credit and interest rate risks 
current environment 
precipitated by housing sector weakness and severe market dislocations  the us economy entered its worst post war recession in january most economists believe this recession ended in third quarter when positive growth returned 
most economists now expect positive growth to continue through however  the expected recovery is weaker than normal  and the unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time 
although the disruption in the global financial markets has moderated  not all global financial markets are functioning normally  and many remain reliant upon government intervention and liquidity 
as a result of this unprecedented disruption and market dislocation  we have experienced both volatility in the valuation of certain investments and decreased liquidity in certain asset classes 
securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and have fewer opportunities for disposal 
even some of our very high quality assets have been more illiquid for periods of time as a result of the recent challenging market conditions 
these market conditions had also led to an increase in unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities in recent quarters  particularly for residential and commercial mortgage backed  asset backed and corporate fixed maturity securities and within the company s financial services industry fixed maturity and equity securities holdings 
during  
table of contents unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities decreased from improving market conditions  including narrowing of credit spreads reflecting an improvement in liquidity 
investment outlook although we anticipate that the volatility in the equity  credit and real estate markets will moderate slightly in  it could continue to impact net investment income and the related yields on private equity funds  hedge funds and real estate joint ventures  included within our other limited partnership interests and real estate and real estate joint venture portfolios 
further  in light of the current market conditions  liquidity will be reinvested in a prudent manner and invested according to our alm discipline in appropriate assets over time 
until the additional liquidity is reinvested  the company will have a slightly higher than normal level of short term liquidity 
net investment income may be adversely affected if the reinvestment process occurs over an extended period of time due to challenging market conditions or asset availability

privately held equity securities represented billion and billion  or and of total equity securities at estimated fair value  at december  and  respectively 
valuation of securities 
we are responsible for the determination of estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity  equity and trading securities  as well as short term securities is determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information quoted market prices in active markets  independent pricing services  or independent broker quotations 
the number of quotes obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument 
generally  we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities  but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy 
independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on inputs that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or similar techniques 
the assumptions and inputs in applying these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration  and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
when a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service  management will value the security primarily using independent non binding broker quotations 
independent non binding broker quotations utilize inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
senior management  independent of the trading and investing functions  is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies  including reviewing and approving new transaction types and markets  for ensuring that observable market prices and market based parameters are used for valuation  wherever possible  and for determining that judgmental valuation adjustments  if any  are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time 
we review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and ensure that any changes to valuation methodologies are justified 
we gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions  valuation methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through various controls designed to ensure that the financial assets and financial liabilities are appropriately valued and represent an exit price 
the control systems and procedures include  but are not limited to  analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns  comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates  comparing fair value estimates to management s knowledge of the current market  reviewing the bid ask spreads to assess activity and ongoing confirmation that independent pricing services use  wherever possible  market based parameters for valuation 
we determine the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data 
the company also follows a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value 
if we conclude that prices received from independent pricing services are not reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value  we will seek independent non binding broker quotes or use an internally 
table of contents developed valuation to override these prices 
such overrides are classified as level despite the credit events prevalent in the current markets  including market dislocation  volatility in valuation of certain investments  and reduced levels of liquidity over the past few quarters  our internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value  which reflect our estimates of liquidity and non performance risks  compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services  did not produce material differences for the vast majority of our fixed maturity securities portfolio 
our estimates of liquidity and non performance risks are generally based on available market evidence and on what other market participants would use 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
as a result  we generally continued to use the price provided by the independent pricing service under our normal pricing protocol and pricing overrides were not material 
the company uses the results of this analysis for classifying the estimated fair value of these instruments in level  or for example  we will review the estimated fair values received to determine whether corroborating evidence ie  similar observable positions and actual trades will support a level classification in the fair value hierarchy 
security prices which cannot be corroborated due to relatively less pricing transparency and diminished liquidity will be classified as level even some of our very high quality invested assets have been more illiquid for periods of time as a result of the current market conditions 
for privately placed fixed maturity securities  the company determines the estimated fair value generally through matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques 
the discounted cash flow valuations rely upon the estimated future cash flows of the security  credit spreads of comparable public securities and secondary transactions  as well as taking account of  among other factors  the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with privately placed debt securities 
the company has reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of its securities 
based on the results of this review and investment class analyses  each instrument is categorized as level  or based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation methodologies 
while prices for certain us treasury  agency and government guaranteed fixed maturity securities  certain foreign government fixed maturity securities  exchange traded common stock and certain short term money market securities have been classified into level because of high volumes of trading activity and narrow bid ask spreads  most securities valued by independent pricing services have been classified into level because the significant inputs used in pricing these securities are market observable or can be corroborated using market observable information 
most investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities have been classified within level  while most below investment grade or distressed privately placed fixed maturity securities have been classified within level where estimated fair values are determined by independent pricing services or by independent non binding broker quotations that utilize inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  these instruments have been classified as level use of independent non binding broker quotations generally indicates there is a lack of liquidity or the general lack of transparency in the process to develop these price estimates causing them to be considered level effective april   the company adopted new accounting guidance that clarified existing guidance regarding estimating the estimated fair value of an asset or liability if there was a significant decrease in the volume and level of trading activity for these assets or liabilities and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the company s valuation policies as described above and in summary of critical accounting estimates estimated fair values of investments already incorporated the key concepts from this additional guidance  accordingly  this guidance results in no material changes in our valuation policies 
at april  and at each subsequent quarterly period in  we evaluated the markets that our fixed maturity and equity securities trade in and in our judgment  despite the increased illiquidity discussed above  believe none of these fixed maturity and equity securities trading markets should be characterized as distressed and disorderly 
we will continue to re evaluate and monitor such fixed maturity and equity securities trading markets on an ongoing basis 

table of contents fair value hierarchy 
fixed maturity securities and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources and fair value hierarchy are as follows december  equity fixed maturity securities securities in millions quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level independent pricing source internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques significant other observable inputs level independent pricing source internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques independent broker quotations significant unobservable inputs level total estimated fair value december  fair value measurements using quoted prices significant in active other significant markets for observable unobservable total identical assets inputs inputs estimated level level level fair value in millions fixed maturity securities us corporate securities residential mortgage backed securities rmbs foreign corporate securities us treasury  agency and government guaranteed securities commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs asset backed securities abs foreign government securities state and political subdivision securities other fixed maturity securities total fixed maturity securities equity securities common stock non redeemable preferred stock total equity securities the composition of fair value pricing sources for and significant changes in level securities at december  are as follows the majority of the level fixed maturity and equity securities  as presented above were concentrated in four sectors us and foreign corporate securities  abs and rmbs 

table of contents level fixed maturity securities are priced principally through independent broker quotations or market standard valuation methodologies using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
level fixed maturity securities consists of less liquid fixed maturity securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation methodologies including newly issued agency backed rmbs yet to be priced by independent sources  below investment grade private placements and less liquid investment grade corporate securities included in us and foreign corporate securities and less liquid abs including securities supported by sub prime mortgage loans included in abs 
during the year ended december   level fixed maturity securities decreased by million  or 
favorable estimated fair value changes recognized in other comprehensive income loss were partially offset by transfers out primarily concentrated in foreign corporate securities and to a lesser extent net sales and settlements in excess of purchases and realized and unrealized losses included in earnings 
the increase in estimated fair value in fixed maturity securities was concentrated in us and foreign corporate securities and abs including rmbs backed by sub prime mortgage loans due to improving market conditions including the narrowing of credit spreads reflecting an improvement in liquidity  offset slightly by the effect of rising interest rates on such securities 
the transfers out of level are described in the discussion following the rollforward table below 
net sales and settlements in excess of purchases of fixed maturity securities were concentrated in us and foreign corporate securities 
the realized and unrealized losses included in earnings were primarily due to otti credit losses  including otti credit losses on perpetual hybrid securities included in us and foreign corporate securities 
a rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity securities and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable level inputs for the year ended december  is as follows year ended december  fixed maturity equity securities securities in millions balance  beginning of year total realized unrealized gains losses included in earnings other comprehensive income loss purchases  sales  issuances and settlements transfers in and or out of level balance  end of year an analysis of transfers in and or out of level for the year ended december  is as follows total gains and losses in earnings and other comprehensive income loss are calculated assuming transfers in or out of level occurred at the beginning of the period 
items transferred in and out for the same period are excluded from the rollforward 
total gains and losses for fixed maturity securities included in earnings of million and other comprehensive income loss of million respectively  were incurred for transfers subsequent to their transfer to level  for the year ended december  net transfers in and or out of level for fixed maturity securities were  million for the year ended december   and was comprised of transfers in of  million and transfers out of  million  respectively 

table of contents overall  transfers in and or out of level are attributable to a change in the observability of inputs 
during the year ended december   fixed maturity securities transfers out of level of  million resulted primarily from increased transparency of both new issuances that subsequent to issuance and establishment of trading activity  became priced by pricing services and existing issuances that  over time  the company was able to corroborate pricing received from independent pricing services with observable inputs  primarily for us and foreign corporate securities 
during the year ended december   fixed maturity securities transfers into level of  million resulted primarily from current market conditions characterized by a lack of trading activity  decreased liquidity  fixed maturity securities going into default and credit ratings downgrades eg  from investment grade to below investment grade 
these current market conditions have resulted in decreased transparency of valuations and an increased use of broker quotations and unobservable inputs to determine estimated fair value principally for us and foreign corporate securities

fixed maturity securities credit quality ratings 
the securities valuation office of the naic evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called naic designations 
the naic ratings are generally similar to the rating agency designations of the nrsro for marketable fixed maturity securities 
naic ratings and include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade ie rated baa or better by moody s or rated bbb or better by s p and fitch  by such rating organizations 
naic ratings through include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade ie rated ba or lower by moody s  or rated bb or lower by s p and fitch  by such rating organizations 
the naic adopted a revised rating methodology for non agency rmbs that became effective december  the naic s objective with the revised rating methodology for non agency rmbs was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses  and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for non agency rmbs 
the revised methodology reduces regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allows for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from non agency rmbs 
the following three tables present information about the company s fixed maturity securities holdings by credit quality ratings 
amounts presented for non agency rmbs  including rmbs backed by sub prime mortgage loans reported within abs  held by the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries at december  are based on final ratings from the revised naic rating methodology which became effective december  comparisons between naic ratings and rating agency designations are published by the naic 
the rating agency designations were based on availability of applicable ratings from those rating agencies on the naic acceptable rating organizations list

the majority of the company s agency rmbs were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the fnma  the fhlmc or the gnma 
non agency rmbs includes prime and alt a rmbs 
prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of residential mortgage loans to the most credit worthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles 
alt a are a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower falls between prime and sub prime 
sub prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles 
during  the major rating agencies made significant revisions to their methodologies and loss expectations for non agency rmbs  resulting in significant downgrades for both prime and alt a rmbs  contributing to the decrease in the percentage of rmbs with aaa aaa ratings at december  as compared to december  our analysis suggests that rating agencies are applying essentially the same default methodology to all alt a securities regardless of the underlying collateral 
the company s alt a securities portfolio has superior structure to the overall alt a market 
at december  and  the company s alt a securities portfolio has no exposure to option adjustable rate mortgages arms and a minimal exposure to hybrid arms 
the company s alt a securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate mortgages which have performed better than both option arms and hybrid arms in the overall alt a market

cmbs 
there have been disruptions in the cmbs market due to market perceptions that default rates will increase in part due to weakness in commercial real estate market fundamentals and due in part to relaxed underwriting standards by some originators of commercial mortgage loans within the more recent vintage years ie  and later 
these factors have caused a pull back in market liquidity  increased credit spreads and repricing of risk  which has led to higher levels of unrealized losses as compared to historical levels

based upon the company s current evaluation of these securities in accordance with its impairment policy  the cause of the decline in  or improvement in  gross unrealized losses for the year ended december  being primarily attributable to improving market conditions  including narrowing of credit spreads reflecting an improvement in liquidity and the company s current intentions and assessments as applicable to the type of security about holding  selling  and any requirements to sell these securities  the company has concluded that these securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
in the company s impairment review process  the duration and severity of an unrealized loss position for equity securities is given greater weight and consideration than for fixed maturity securities 
an extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments and the company s evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected 
in contrast  for an equity security  greater weight and consideration is given by the company to a decline in market value and the likelihood such market value decline will recover

table of contents in connection with the equity securities impairment review process at december   the company evaluated its holdings in non redeemable preferred stock  particularly those of financial services companies 
the company considered several factors including whether there has been any deterioration in credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of non redeemable preferred stock with a severe or an extended unrealized loss 
the company also considered whether any non redeemable preferred stock with an unrealized loss  regardless of credit rating  have deferred any dividend payments 
no such dividend payments were deferred 
with respect to common stock holdings  the company considered the duration and severity of the unrealized losses for securities in an unrealized loss position of or more and the duration of unrealized losses for securities in an unrealized loss position of or less in an extended unrealized loss position ie  months or greater 
future other than temporary impairments will depend primarily on economic fundamentals  issuer performance including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected  changes in credit rating  changes in collateral valuation  changes in interest rates and changes in credit spreads

mortgage loan credit quality monitoring process commercial and agricultural loans 
the company reviews all commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis 
these reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll  lease rollover analysis  property inspections  market analysis  
table of contents estimated valuations of the underlying collateral  loan to value ratios  debt service coverage ratios  and tenant creditworthiness 
the monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans  which include those that are classified as restructured  potentially delinquent  delinquent or in foreclosure  as well as loans with higher loan to value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios 
the monitoring process for agricultural loans is generally similar  with a focus on higher risk loans  including reviews of the portfolio on a geographic and sector basis 
loan to value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans 
loan to value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
a loan to value ratio greater than indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
a loan to value ratio of less than indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount 
the debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan 
for commercial loans  at december   the average loan to value ratio was  as compared to at december   and the average debt service coverage ratio was x  as compared to x at december  the values utilized in calculating these ratios are developed in connection with our review of the commercial loan portfolio  and are updated routinely  including a periodic quality rating process and an evaluation of the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
mortgage loan credit quality monitoring process residential and consumer loans 
the company has a conservative residential and consumer loan portfolio and does not hold any option arms  sub prime  low teaser rate  or loans with a loan to value ratio of or more 
higher risk loans include those that are classified as restructured  potentially delinquent  delinquent or in foreclosure  as well as loans with higher loan to value ratios and interest only loans 
the company s investment in residential junior lien loans and residential loans with a loan to value ratio of or more was million at december   and the majority of the higher loan to value loans have mortgage insurance coverage which reduces the loan to value ratio to less than 
additionally  the company s investment in traditional residential interest only loans was million at december  mortgage loans valuation allowances 
recent economic events causing deteriorating market conditions  low levels of liquidity and credit spread widening have all adversely impacted the mortgage loan markets 
as a result  commercial real estate and residential and consumer loan market fundamentals  and fundamentals in certain sectors of the agricultural loan market  have weakened 
the company expects continued pressure on these fundamentals  including but not limited to declining rent growth  increased vacancies  rising delinquencies and declining property values 
these deteriorating factors have been considered in the company s ongoing  systematic and comprehensive review of the commercial  agricultural and residential and consumer mortgage loan portfolios  resulting in higher impairments and valuation allowances for the year ended december  as compared to the prior periods 
the company s valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss  as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified  but for which the company expects to incur a loss 
accordingly  a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses 
the company records valuation allowances and gains and losses from the sale of loans in net investment gains losses 
the company records valuation allowances for loans considered to be impaired when it is probable that  based upon current information and events  the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loans being impaired  loan specific valuation allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the loan over either i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the estimated fair value of the loan s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent  or iii the loan s observable market price 
the company also establishes valuation allowances for loan losses for pools of loans with similar characteristics  such as loans based on similar property types or loans with similar loan to value or similar debt service coverage ratio factors when  based on past experience  it is probable that a credit event has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents the determination of the amount of  and additions to  valuation allowances is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with its loan portfolios 
such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors  including the company s experience for loan losses  defaults and loss severity  and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics 
these evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations regularly  which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised  and such changes in the valuation allowance are also recorded in net investment gains losses

guarantees in the normal course of its business  the company has provided certain indemnities  guarantees and commitments to third parties pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in the future 
in the context of acquisition  disposition  investment and other transactions  the company has provided indemnities and guarantees  including those related to tax  environmental and other specific liabilities  and other indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants provided by the company 
in addition  in the normal course of business  the company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing  as well as for certain other liabilities  such as third party lawsuits 
these obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration  including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law  such as applicable statutes of limitation 
in some cases  the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than million to million  with a cumulative maximum of billion  while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable 
since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations  we do not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future 
we believe that it is unlikely the company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities  guarantees  or commitments 
in addition  the company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by laws 
also  the company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the company s interests 
since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount  the company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future 
the company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on certain international retirement funds in accordance with local laws 
since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount  the company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future 
during the year ended december   the company reduced million of previously recorded liabilities related to certain investment transactions 
the company s recorded liabilities were million and million at december  and  respectively  for indemnities  guarantees and commitments 
in connection with synthetically created investment transactions  the company writes credit default swap obligations that generally require payment of principal outstanding due in exchange for the referenced credit obligation 
if a credit event  as defined by the contract  occurs the company s maximum amount at risk  assuming the value of all referenced credit obligations is zero  was billion at december  however  the company believes that any actual future losses will be significantly lower than this amount 
additionally  the company can terminate these contracts at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the credit default swaps 
at december   the company would have paid million to terminate all of these contracts

policyholder liabilities the company establishes  and carries as liabilities  actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered  an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events  or to provide for future annuity payments 
amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
for more details on policyholder liabilities see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of critical accounting estimates 
also see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of certain policyholder liabilities at december  and due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities  the company cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities  and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts  particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future 
however  we believe our actuarial liabilities for future benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to be paid to policyholders 
we periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience 
we revise estimates  to the extent permitted or required under gaap  if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities 
the company has experienced  and will likely in the future experience  catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism  and turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including pandemics  hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  tornadoes  explosions  severe winter weather including snow  freezing water  ice storms and blizzards  fires and man made events such as terrorist attacks 
due to their nature  we cannot predict the incidence  timing  severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism  but we make broad use of catastrophic and non catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils 
future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of expected future benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of expected future net premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits include mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumed and future losses are projected under loss recognition testing  then additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
insurance products 
future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions  liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance  long term care policies  active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under participating life insurance contracts 
in order to manage risk  the company has often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on new 
table of contents individual life insurance policies 
the reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage 
the company entered into various derivative positions  primarily interest rate swaps and swaptions  to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts 
retirement products 
future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life contingent income annuities  supplemental contracts with and without life contingencies  liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdbs included in certain annuity contracts  and a certain portion of guaranteed living benefits 
see variable annuity guarantees 
corporate benefit funding 
liabilities are primarily related to structured settlement annuities 
there is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities 
a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result 
the company has various derivative positions  primarily interest rate floors and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario 
auto home 
future policy benefits include liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty insurance and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies  levels of severities  inflation  judicial trends  legislative changes or regulatory decisions 
assumptions are based upon the company s historical experience and analyses of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business  and consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
international 
future policy benefits are held primarily for immediate annuities in the latin america region  as well as for total return pass thru provisions included in certain universal life and savings products in latin america  and traditional life  endowment and annuity contracts sold in various countries in the asia pacific region 
they also include certain liabilities for variable annuity guarantees of minimum death benefits  and longevity guarantees sold in the asia pacific region 
finally  in the emei region  they also include unearned premium liabilities established for credit insurance contracts covering death  disability and involuntary loss of employment  as well as a small amount of traditional life and endowment contracts 
factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at issue  lower than expected asset reinvestment rates  asset default and more rapid improvement of mortality levels than anticipated for life contingent immediate annuities 
the company mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and through the development of periodic experience studies 
see variable annuity guarantees 
estimates for the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses are reset as actuarial indications change and these changes in the liability are reflected in the current results of operation as either favorable or unfavorable development of prior year losses 
banking  corporate other 
future policy benefits primarily include liabilities for quota share reinsurance agreements for certain long term care and workers compensation business written by micc  a subsidiary of the company  prior to the acquisition of micc 
these are run off businesses that have been included within banking  corporate other since the acquisition of micc 
policyholder account balances policyholder account balances are generally equal to the account value  which includes accrued interest credited  but exclude the impact of any applicable surrender charge that may be incurred upon surrender 
insurance products 
policyholder account balances are held for death benefit disbursement retained asset accounts  universal life policies  the fixed account of variable life insurance policies  specialized life insurance products for benefit programs  general account universal life policies  and the fixed account of variable life insurance policies 
policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate set by the company  which are influenced by current market rates 
the majority of the policyholder account balances have a guaranteed minimum credited rate between and 
a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings 
table of contents as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees 
the company has various derivative positions  primarily interest rate floors  to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario

corporate benefit funding 
policyholder account balances are comprised of funding agreements 
interest crediting rates vary by type of contract  and can be fixed or variable 
variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index  most commonly month or month libor 
metlife is exposed to interest rate risks  and foreign exchange risk when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date 
the company may invest in floating rate assets  or enter into floating rate swaps  also tied to external indices  as well as caps to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company also mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and seeks to hedge all foreign currency risk through the use of foreign currency hedges  including cross currency swaps 
international 
policyholder account balances are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans in the latin america region and to a lesser degree  amounts for separate account type funds in certain countries in the latin america  asia pacific and emei regions that do not meet the us gaap definition of separate accounts 
also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in the asia pacific region that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees 
liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in the asia pacific region are established in accordance with derivatives and hedging guidance and are also included within policyholder account balances 
these liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates  where there are interest rate guarantees 
the company mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and by hedging its variable annuity guarantees 
see variable annuity guarantees 
variable annuity guarantees the company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit ie  the benefit base less withdrawals 
in some cases the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits  bonus amounts  accruals or market value resets 
these guarantees are accounted for as insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on how and when the benefit is paid 
specifically  a guarantee is accounted for as an embedded derivative if a guarantee is paid without requiring i the occurrence of specific insurable event or ii the policyholder to annuitize 
alternatively  a guarantee is accounted for as an insurance liability if the guarantee is paid only upon either i the occurrence of a specific insurable event or ii upon annuitization 
in certain cases  a guarantee may have elements of both an insurance liability and an embedded derivative and in such cases the guarantee is accounted for under a split of the two models 
the net amount at risk nar for guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  increased equity volatility  or changes in interest rates 
the nar disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements represents management s estimate of the current value of the benefits under these guarantees if they were all exercised simultaneously at december  and  respectively 
however  there are features  such as deferral periods and benefits requiring annuitization or death  that limit the amount of benefits that will be payable in the near future 
none of the gmib guarantees are eligible for a guaranteed annuitization prior to guarantees  including portions thereof  accounted for as embedded derivatives  are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances 
guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include gmab  the non life contingent portion of gmwb and the portion of certain gmib that do not require annuitization 
for more detail on the determination of estimated fair value  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the table below contains the carrying value for guarantees included in policyholder account balances at december  in millions us business guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit international guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit total included in net investment gains losses for the year ended december  and were gains losses of billion and billion  respectively  in embedded derivatives related to the change in estimated fair value of the above guarantees 
the carrying amount of guarantees accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for the company s own credit 
in connection with this adjustment  gains losses of billion and billion are included in the gains losses of billion and billion in net investment gains losses for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the estimated fair value of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  equity volatility  interest rates or foreign exchange rates 
additionally  because the estimated fair value for guarantees accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for the company s own credit  a decrease in the company s credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to increase 
conversely  a widening of the company s credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to decrease 
the company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities 
the derivative instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures  equity options and variance swaps  and interest rate swaps 
the change in valuation arising from the company s own credit is not hedged

table of contents guarantees  including portions thereof  have liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits 
guarantees accounted for in this manner include gmdbs  the life contingent portion of certain gmwb  and the portion of gmib that require annuitization 
these liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns 
the scenarios use best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize deferred acquisition costs 
when current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected  liabilities will increase  resulting in a current period charge to net income 
the opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected 
at each reporting period  the company updates the actual amount of business remaining in force  which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings 
the table below contains the carrying value for guarantees included in future policy benefits at december  in millions us business guaranteed minimum death benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit international guaranteed minimum death benefit total included in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended december  is a credit of million and for the year ended december  is a charge of million  related to the respective change in liabilities for the above guarantees 
the carrying amount of guarantees accounted for as insurance liabilities can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  increased equity volatility  or changes in interest rates 
the company uses reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities 
derivative instruments used are primarily equity futures  treasury futures and interest rate swaps 
included in policyholder benefits and claims associated with the hedging of the guarantees in future policy benefits for the year ended december  and were gains losses of million and million  respectively  related to reinsurance treaties containing embedded derivatives carried at estimated fair value and gains losses of million and million  respectively  related to freestanding derivatives 
while the company believes that the hedging strategies employed for guarantees included in both policyholder account balances and in future policy benefits  as well as other management actions  have mitigated the risks related to these benefits  the company remains liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay 
certain of the company s reinsurance agreements and derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements  both of which  significantly reduces the exposure to counterparty risk 
in addition  the company is subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality  combined with adverse market events  produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed 
lastly  because the valuation of the guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an adjustment for the company s own credit that is not hedged  changes in the company s own credit may result in significant volatility in net income 

table of contents other policyholder funds other policyholder funds include policy and contract claims  unearned revenue liabilities  premiums received in advance  policyholder dividends due and unpaid  and policyholder dividends left on deposit 
the liability for policy and contract claims generally relates to incurred but not reported death  disability  long term care and dental claims  as well as claims that have been reported but not yet settled 
the liability for these claims is based on the company s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims 
the company derives estimates for the development of incurred but not reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims development for each line of business 
the methods used to determine these estimates are continually reviewed 
adjustments resulting from this continuous review process and differences between estimates and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
the unearned revenue liability relates to universal life type and investment type products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods 
the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the product s estimated gross profits and margins  similar to deferred acquisition costs 
such amortization is recorded in universal life and investment type product policy fees 
also included in other policyholder funds are policyholder dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and policyholder dividends left on deposit 
such liabilities are presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders 
policyholder dividends payable policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year on participating policies 
liquidity and capital resources overview beginning in september  the global financial markets experienced unprecedented disruption  adversely affecting the business environment in general  as well as financial services companies in particular 
the us economy entered a recession in january and most economists believe this recession ended in the third quarter of when positive growth returned 
most economists now expect positive growth to continue through conditions in the financial markets have materially improved  but financial institutions may have to pay higher spreads over benchmark us treasury securities than before the market disruption began 
there is still some uncertainty as to whether the stressed conditions that prevailed during the market disruption could recur  which could affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs and obtain capital 
liquidity management 
based upon the strength of its franchise  diversification of its businesses and strong financial fundamentals  we continue to believe that the company has ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and unlikely but reasonably possible stress scenarios 
the company s short term liquidity position cash  and cash equivalents and short term investments  excluding cash collateral received under the company s securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities and cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivative instruments was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
this reduction in short term liquidity reflects the continued improvement in market conditions during the year ended december  during  the company invested a portion of its short term liquidity position in longer term  high quality  liquid asset types such as us government securities and agency residential mortgage backed securities 
we continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for the holding company and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities 

table of contents the company liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs 
liquidity needs are determined from a rolling month forecast by portfolio and are monitored daily 
asset mix and maturities are adjusted based on the forecast 
cash flow testing and stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity  which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal 
we believe that the company has ample liquidity and capital resources to meet business requirements under current market conditions and unlikely but reasonably possible stress scenarios under current market conditions 
the company includes provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of its products  including general account institutional pension products generally group annuities  including funding agreements  and certain deposit fund liabilities sold to employee benefit plan sponsors 
certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product 
in the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs  the company has various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need 
these options include cash flows from operations  the sale of liquid assets  global funding sources and various credit facilities 
under certain stressful market and economic conditions  liquidity may deteriorate broadly which could negatively impact the company 
if the company requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements  the company may have difficulty selling investment assets in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than the company otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
in addition  in the event of such forced sale  accounting rules require the recognition of a loss for certain securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities based upon the company s ability to hold such securities  which may negatively impact the company s financial condition 
a disruption in the financial markets could limit the company s access to  or cost of  liquidity 
in extreme circumstances  all general account assets other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose within a statutory legal entity are available to fund obligations of the general account within that legal entity 
capital capital reflects the financial strength of the company and its ability to generate strong cash flows at the operating companies  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs 
while the company raised new capital from its debt issuances during the difficult market conditions prevailing since the second half of see the company liquidity and capital sources debt issuances and other borrowings  the increase in credit spreads experienced since then has resulted in an increase in the cost of such new capital 
as a result of reductions in interest rates  the company s interest expense and dividends on floating rate securities have been lower  however  the increase in the company s credit spreads since the second half of has caused the company s credit facility fees to increase 
the company manages its capital structure to maintain a level of capital needed for aa financial strength ratings 
however  we believe that the rating agencies have recently heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to life insurance companies and are considering several other factors  in addition to the level of capital  in assigning financial strength ratings 
the rating agencies may also adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 
statutory capital and dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements 
rbc requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action 
rbc is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and statutory reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the 
table of contents insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis 
the formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
these rules apply to each of the holding company s domestic insurance subsidiaries 
state insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain rbc levels 
at the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators  the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those rbc levels 
the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to the holding company or other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings and provide an additional margin for risk protection and invest in our businesses 
we proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives  which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital 
certain of these activities may require regulatory approval 
rating agencies 
rating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to the company s domestic life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to the holding company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the level and composition of our regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and equity capital of the company are among the many factors considered in determining the company s insurer financial strength and credit ratings 
each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors 
we believe that the rating agencies have recently heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies  and that they may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  may request additional information from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 
the company s financial strength ratings for its domestic life insurance companies are aa aa aa a for s p  moody s  fitch  and am best  respectively 
the company s long term senior debt credit ratings are a a a a for s p  moody s  fitch  and am best  respectively 
the company s ratings outlooks are creditwatch negative stable stable under review with negative implications for s p  moody s  fitch  and am best  respectively 
for further discussion  see business company ratings 
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ie  claims paying ratings of the company or its subsidiaries would likely impact the cost and availability of financing for the company and its subsidiaries and result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
liquidity and capital sources cash flows from operations 
the company s principal cash inflows from its insurance activities come from insurance premiums  annuity considerations and deposit funds 
a primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash inflows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal

included within future policyholder benefits are contracts where the company is currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event such as death  as well as those where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract 
also included are contracts where the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death or illness  or where the occurrence of the payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy or contract  is outside the control of the company 
the company has estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience  as well as its expectation of future payment patterns 
liabilities related to accounting conventions  or which are not contractually due  such as shadow liabilities  excess interest reserves and property and casualty loss adjustment expenses  of million have been excluded from amounts presented in the table above 
amounts presented in the table above  excluding those related to property and casualty contracts  represent the estimated cash payments for benefits under such contracts including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and assumptions related to mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  inflation  disability incidence  disability terminations  policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
payments for case reserve liabilities and incurred but not reported liabilities associated with property and casualty contracts of billion have been included using an estimate of the ultimate amount to be settled under the policies based upon historical payment patterns 
the ultimate amount to be paid under property and casualty contracts is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant  which may vary significantly from the liability or contractual obligation presented above especially as it relates to incurred but not reported liabilities 
all estimated cash payments presented in the table above are undiscounted as to interest  net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable 
the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than years from the present date 

table of contents the sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the liability amount of billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to the time value of money  which accounts for at least of the difference  as well as differences in assumptions  most significantly mortality  between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date 
for the majority of the company s insurance operations  estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balance liabilities as presented in the table above are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes 
these cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under generally accepted accounting principles 
see policyholder account balances below 
actual cash payments to policyholders may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments as presented in the table above due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments 
policyholder account balances policyholder account balances include liabilities related to conventional guaranteed interest contracts  guaranteed interest contracts associated with formal offering programs  funding agreements  individual and group annuities  total control accounts  individual and group universal life  variable universal life and company owned life insurance 
included within policyholder account balances are contracts where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to policies where the company is currently making payments and will continue to do so  as well as those where the timing of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts involve payment obligations where the timing of future payments is uncertain and where the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death  or where the occurrence of the payment triggering event  such as a surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  is outside the control of the company 
the company has estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience  as well as its expectation of future payment patterns

such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable 
for obligations denominated in foreign currencies  cash payments have been estimated using current spot rates 
the sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the liability amount of billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to the time value of money  which accounts for at least of the difference  as well as differences in assumptions between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date 
see the comments under future policyholder benefits above regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policyholder benefits and policyholder account balances 
other policyholder liabilities other policyholder liabilities are comprised of other policyholder funds  policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation

other policyholder funds includes liabilities for incurred but not reported claims and claims payable on group term life  long term disability  ltc and dental  policyholder dividends left on deposit and policyholder dividends due and unpaid related primarily to traditional life and group life and health  and premiums received in advance 
liabilities related to unearned revenue of billion have been excluded from the cash payments presented in the table above because they reflect an accounting convention and not a contractual obligation 
with the exception of policyholder dividends left on deposit  and those 
table of contents items excluded as noted in the preceding sentence  the contractual obligation presented in the table above related to other policyholder funds is equal to the liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
such amounts are reported in the less than one year category due to the short term nature of the liabilities 
contractual obligations on policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity 
b 
policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year on participating policies 
as such  the contractual obligation related to policyholder dividends payable is presented in the table above in the less than one year category at the amount of the liability presented in the consolidated balance sheets 
c 
the nature of the policyholder dividend obligation is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long term projection of the performance of the closed block  we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability  if any  presented in the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category 
this was presented to reflect the long duration of the liability and the uncertainty of the ultimate cash payment 
bank deposits bank deposits of billion exceed the amount on the balance sheet of billion due to the inclusion of estimated interest payments 
liquid deposits  including demand deposit accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts  are assumed to mature at carrying value within one year 
certificates of deposit are assumed to pay all interest and principal at maturity 
short term debt  long term debt  collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities amounts presented in the table above for short term debt  long term debt  collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities differ from the balances presented on the consolidated balance sheet as the amounts presented in the table above do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments 
the amounts presented above also include interest on such obligations as described below 
short term debt consists of borrowings with original maturities of less than one year carrying fixed interest rates 
the contractual obligation for short term debt presented in the table above represents the amounts due upon maturity plus the related interest for the period from january  through maturity 
long term debt bears interest at fixed and variable interest rates through their respective maturity dates 
interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations through maturity 
interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
long term debt also includes payments under capital lease obligations of million  million  and million  in the less than one year  one to three years  three to five years and more than five years categories  respectively 
collateral financing arrangements bear interest at fixed and variable interest rates through their respective maturity dates 
interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations through maturity 
interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
pursuant to these collateral financing arrangements  the holding company may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the respective unaffiliated financial institutions 
see the company liquidity and capital sources collateral financing arrangements 
junior subordinated debt securities bear interest at fixed interest rates through their respective redemption dates 
interest was computed using the stated rates on the obligations through the scheduled redemption dates as it is the company s expectation that the debt will be redeemed at that time 
inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by billion 
payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions the company has accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivative transactions

we manage this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our asset liability management strategies including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity guarantee benefits 
the company also manages equity price risk incurred in its investment portfolio through the use of derivatives 
equity exposures associated with other limited partnership interests are excluded from this section as they are not considered financial instruments under generally accepted accounting principles 
management of market risk exposures the company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk  including the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk management 
to manage interest rate risk  the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models  including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
the new york state insurance department regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of metlife s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves 
for several of its legal entities  the company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of asset liability management and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities less the dac asset and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to the surplus segment 
the operating segments may reflect differences in legal entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
the company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing company models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting 
table of contents rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 
common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how the company intends to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each asset portfolio has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and non medical health products  the company may support such liabilities with equity investments  derivatives or curve mismatch strategies 
foreign currency exchange rate risk management 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is assumed primarily in three ways investments in foreign subsidiaries  purchases of foreign currency denominated investments in the investment portfolio and the sale of certain insurance products 
the company s treasury department is responsible for managing the exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries 
limits to exposures are established and monitored by the treasury department and managed by the investment department 
the investment department is responsible for managing the exposure to foreign currency investments 
exposure limits to unhedged foreign currency investments are incorporated into the standing authorizations granted to management by the board of directors and are reported to the board of directors on a periodic basis 
the lines of business are responsible for establishing limits and managing any foreign exchange rate exposure caused by the sale or issuance of insurance products 
metlife uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments  its equity exposure in subsidiaries and its foreign currency exposures caused by the sale of insurance products 
equity price risk management 
equity price risk incurred through the issuance of variable annuities is managed by the company s asset liability management unit in partnership with the investment department 
equity price risk is also incurred through its investment in equity securities and is managed by its investment department 
metlife uses derivatives to hedge its equity exposure both in certain liability guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefit and equity securities 
these derivatives include exchange traded equity futures  equity index options contracts and equity variance swaps 
the company s derivative hedges performed effectively through the extreme movements in the equity markets during the latter part of the company also employs reinsurance to manage these exposures 
hedging activities 
metlife uses derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and equity risk 
derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on accounting results and gaap and statutory capital 
the construction of the company s derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged 
some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets 
the company s use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows risks related to living guarantee benefits the company uses a wide range of derivative contracts to hedge the risk associated with variable annuity living guarantee benefits 
these hedges include equity and interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  currency futures forwards  equity indexed options and interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps 
minimum interest rate guarantees for certain company liability contracts  the company provides the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate 
these contracts include certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities 
the company purchases interest rate floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees 

table of contents reinvestment risk in long duration liability contracts derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts  such as long term care 
hedges include zero coupon interest rate swaps and swaptions 
foreign currency risk the company uses currency swaps and forwards to hedge foreign currency risk 
these hedges primarily swap foreign currency denominated bonds  investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity exposures to us dollars 
general alm hedging strategies in the ordinary course of managing the company s asset liability risks  the company uses interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floors and inflation swaps 
these hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows 
risk measurement sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing the analysis summarized below  the company used market rates at december  the sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of the company s market risk exposures interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate relating to its trading and non trading assets and liabilities 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of its market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the us dollar equivalent estimated fair values of the company s foreign currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates  and the estimated fair value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity market prices 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot ensure that its actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  the derivatives that qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the period 
accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not as substitutes for the experience and judgment of its management 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity exposures

additionally  a change in long term and junior subordinated debt due to an improvement in credit spreads and new issuance of debt  and an increase in the duration of the investment portfolio  decreased risk by million and million  respectively 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest rates across the long end of the swaps and us treasury curves resulting in an increase in the interest rate risk of  million 
the increase in the net base of liabilities and assets of million also increased interest rate risk which contributed to the offset
