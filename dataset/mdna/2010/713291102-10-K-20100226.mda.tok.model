table of contents pepco holdings management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pepco holdings  inc general overview pepco holdings  inc phi or pepco holdings is a diversified energy company that  through its operating subsidiaries  is engaged primarily in two businesses the distribution  transmission and default supply of electricity and the delivery and supply of natural gas power delivery competitive energy generation  marketing and supply competitive energy 
the following table sets forth the percentage contributions to consolidated operating revenue and operating income attributable to the power delivery and competitive energy businesses 
december  including intercompany transactions percentage of consolidated operating revenue power delivery competitive energy percentage of consolidated operating income power delivery competitive energy percentage of power delivery operating revenue power delivery electric power delivery gas power delivery electric consists primarily of the transmission  distribution and default supply of electricity  and power delivery gas consists of the distribution and supply of natural gas 
power delivery represents one operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
the power delivery business is conducted by phi s three utility subsidiaries potomac electric power company pepco  delmarva power light company dpl and atlantic city electric company ace 
each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory 
each company is responsible for the delivery of electricity and  in the case of dpl  natural gas in its service territory  for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commission 
each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier 
the regulatory term for this supply service is standard office service in delaware  the district of columbia and maryland and basic generation service in new jersey 
in this form k  these supply services are referred to generally as default electricity supply 
pepco  dpl and ace are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories 
the rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
transmission rates are updated annually based on a ferc approved formula methodology 
the profitability of the power delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge 
the power delivery operating results historically have been seasonal  generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year 
operating results also can be affected by economic conditions  energy prices and the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity 

table of contents pepco holdings effective june  the maryland public service commission mpsc approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers of pepco and dpl 
the district of columbia public service commission dcpsc also approved a bsa for pepco s retail customers  effective in november for customers to whom the bsa applies  pepco and dpl recognize distribution revenue based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in maryland and the district of columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
for customers to whom the bsa applies  changes in customer usage such as due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue 
as a result of the bsa in maryland and the district of columbia  a revenue decoupling adjustment is recorded representing either a a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from maryland and district and columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that pepco and dpl are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or b a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that pepco and dpl are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
the competitive energy business provides competitive generation  marketing and supply of electricity and gas  and energy management services primarily in the mid atlantic region 
these operations are conducted through subsidiaries of conectiv energy holding company collectively  conectiv energy  which engage primarily in the generation and wholesale supply and marketing of electricity and gas within the pjm interconnection  llc pjm and independent system operator new england isone wholesale markets 
pepco energy services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  pepco energy services  which provide retail energy supply and energy services primarily to commercial  industrial  and governmental customers 
each of conectiv energy and pepco energy services is a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
for the years ended december   and  amounts equal to  and  respectively  of the operating revenues of the competitive energy business were attributable to electric energy and capacity  and natural gas sold to the power delivery segment 
conectiv energy s primary business objective is to maximize the value of its generation fleet by leveraging its operational and fuel flexibilities 
pepco energy services primary objective is to provide energy savings performance contracting services to federal  state and local government and commercial customers throughout the united states 
the financial results of the competitive energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices  the cost of fuel and gas to operate the conectiv energy generating facilities  the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power and gas supply obligations  and the cost of construction services provided by pepco energy services 
the competitive energy business  like the power delivery business  is seasonal  and therefore weather can have a material impact on operating results 
on december   phi announced that it will wind down the retail electric and natural gas supply business that it conducts through pepco energy services 
the decision was made after considering  among other factors  the return phi earns by investing capital in the retail energy supply business as compared to alternative investments 
to effectuate the wind down  pepco energy services will continue to fulfill all of its commercial and regulatory obligations and perform its customer service functions to ensure that it meets 
table of contents pepco holdings the needs of its customers  but will not be entering into any new retail energy supply contracts 
operating revenues related to the retail energy supply business for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively  and operating income amounts for the same periods were million  million and million  respectively 
phi expects the retail energy supply business to remain profitable through december   based on its existing contract backlog and its corresponding portfolio of wholesale hedges  with minimal losses beyond that date 
substantially all of pepco energy services retail customer obligations will be fully performed by june  in connection with the operation of the retail energy supply business  as of december   pepco energy services had collateral requirements  which are based on existing wholesale energy purchase and sale contracts and current market prices  of approximately million committed to its wholesale energy suppliers 
of this collateral amount  million was in the form of letters of credit and million was posted in cash 
pepco energy services estimates that at current market prices  with the wind down of the retail energy supply business  this collateral will be released as follows by december   an aggregate of by december   an aggregate of by december   and substantially all collateral by june   as a result of the decision to wind down the retail energy supply business  pepco energy services in the fourth quarter of recorded i a million pre tax impairment charge reflecting the write off of all goodwill allocated to the business and ii a pre tax charge of less than million related to employee severance 
pepco energy services remaining businesses will not be significantly affected by the wind down of the retail energy supply business 
through its subsidiary potomac capital investment corporation pci  phi maintains a portfolio of cross border energy lease investments with a book value at december  of approximately billion 
this activity constitutes a fourth operating segment  which is designated as other non regulated  for financial reporting purposes 
for a discussion of phi s cross border energy lease investments  see note  commitments and contingencies regulatory and other matters phi s cross border energy lease investments  to the consolidated financial statements of phi  set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
business strategy phi s business strategy is to remain a mid atlantic regional diversified energy delivery utility and competitive energy services company focused on value creation  operational excellence and environmental responsibility 
the components of this strategy include achieving earnings growth in the power delivery business by focusing on transmission and distribution infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes  while maintaining a high level of operational excellence

conectiv energy the impact of operating revenue changes and fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales changes with respect to the conectiv energy component of the competitive energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows 
operating revenues of the conectiv energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity 
the primary components of its costs of sales are fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales 
because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem  price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on operating revenue  fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales without signifying any change in the performance of the conectiv energy segment 
conectiv energy also uses a number of and various types of derivative contracts to lock in sales margins  
table of contents pepco holdings and to economically hedge its power and fuel purchases and sales 
gains and losses on derivative contracts are netted in operating revenue  fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales as appropriate under the applicable accounting rules 
for these reasons  phi from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance

regulated t d electric revenue also includes transmission service revenue that phi s utility subsidiaries receive as transmission owners from pjm 
default electricity supply revenue is the revenue received from the supply of electricity by phi s electric utility subsidiaries at regulated rates to retail customers who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier  and which  depending on the jurisdiction  is also known as sos or bgs service 
the costs related to default electricity supply are included in fuel and purchased energy 
default electricity supply revenue also includes revenue from transition bond charges and other restructuring related revenues 
other electric revenue includes work and services performed on behalf of customers  including other utilities  which is not subject to price regulation 
work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities  highway relocation  rentals of pole attachments  late payment fees  and collection fees 
regulated gas revenue consists of revenues from on system natural gas sales and the transportation of natural gas for customers by dpl within its service territories at regulated rates 
other gas revenue consists of dpl s off system natural gas sales and the short term release of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity not needed to serve customers 
off system sales are made possible when low demand for natural gas by regulated customers creates excess pipeline capacity 
in response to an order issued by the new jersey board of public utilities njbpu regarding changes to ace s retail transmission rates  ace has established deferred accounting treatment for the difference between the rates that ace is authorized to charge its customers for the transmission of default electricity supply and the cost that ace incurs 
under the deferral arrangement  any over or under recovery is deferred as part of deferred electric service costs pending an adjustment of retail rates in a future proceeding 
as a consequence of the order  effective january   ace s retail transmission revenue is being recorded as default electricity supply revenue  rather than as regulated t d electric revenue  thereby conforming to the practice of phi s other utility subsidiaries  which previously established deferred accounting treatment for any over or under recovery of retail transmission rates relative to the cost incurred 
ace s retail transmission revenue for the period prior to january  has been reclassified to default electricity supply revenue in order to conform to the current period presentation

conectiv energy the impact of operating revenue changes and fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales changes with respect to the conectiv energy component of the competitive energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows 
operating revenues of the conectiv energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity 
the primary components of its costs of sales are fuel and purchased power and other services cost of sales 
because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem  price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on operating revenue and costs of sales without signifying any change in the performance of the conectiv energy segment 
conectiv energy also uses a number of and various types of derivative contracts to lock in sales margins  and to economically hedge its power and fuel purchases and sales 
gains and losses on derivative contracts are netted in operating revenue and cost of sales as appropriate under the applicable accounting rules 
for these reasons  phi from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance

the million net liability on energy contracts at december  was primarily attributable to losses on power swaps and natural gas futures and swaps designated as hedges of future energy purchases or production under fasb guidance on derivatives and hedging asc 
prices of electricity and natural gas declined during the year  which resulted in unrealized losses on the energy contracts of the competitive energy business 
competitive energy recorded unrealized losses of million on energy contracts in accumulated other comprehensive loss as these energy contracts were effective hedges under the guidance 
when these energy contracts settle  the related realized gains or losses are expected to be largely offset by the realized loss or gain on future energy purchases or production that will be used to settle the sales obligations of the competitive energy business with its customers

contractual arrangements with credit rating triggers or margining rights under certain contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with the competitive energy business and other transactions  the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the subsidiary are downgraded 
in the event of a downgrade  the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade 
based on contractual provisions in effect at december   a one level downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of phi and each of its rated subsidiaries  which would decrease phi s rating to below investment grade  would increase the collateral obligation of phi and its subsidiaries by up to million  million of which is the net settlement amount attributable to derivatives  normal purchase and normal sale contracts  collateral  and other contracts under master netting agreements as described in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in part ii  item of this form k

phi s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions  diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of phi s potential funding sources 
see item a  risk factors  of this form k  for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
cash flow from operations cash flow generated by regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business is the primary source of phi s cash flow from operations 
additional cash flows are generated by phi s non regulated subsidiaries and from the sale of non core assets 
short term funding sources pepco holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to fund temporarily long term capital requirements 

table of contents pepco holdings pepco holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
pepco and dpl have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to million  and ace up to million 
the commercial paper can be issued with maturities of up to days 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for phi and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness 
regulatory restrictions on financing activities the issuance of debt securities by phi s principal subsidiaries requires approval of either ferc or one or more state public utility commissions 
neither ferc approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by phi 
state financing authority pepco s long term financing activities including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt are subject to authorization by the dcpsc and mpsc 
dpl s long term financing activities are subject to authorization by mpsc and the dpsc 
ace s long term and short term consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less financing activities are subject to authorization by the njbpu 
each utility  through periodic filings with the state public service commission s having jurisdiction over its financing activities  typically seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period 
ferc financing authority under the federal power act fpa  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities  but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating 
under these provisions  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by pepco and dpl 
pepco and dpl have obtained ferc authority for the issuance of short term debt 
because conectiv energy and pepco energy services also qualify as public utilities under the fpa and are not regulated by a state utility commission  ferc also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by those companies 
conectiv energy and pepco energy services have obtained the requisite ferc financing authority in their respective market based rate orders 
money pool pepco holdings operates a system money pool under a blanket authorization adopted by ferc 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by pepco holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool 
pepco holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by pepco holdings 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on pepco holdings short term borrowing rate 
pepco holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants  which may require pepco holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources

critical accounting policies general pepco holdings has identified the following accounting policies  including certain estimates  that as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes in its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
pepco holdings has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
goodwill impairment evaluation phi believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they are subjective and susceptible to change from period to period as management makes assumptions and judgments  and the impact of a change in assumptions and estimates could be material to financial results 
substantially all of phi s goodwill was generated by pepco s acquisition of conectiv in and is allocated to the power delivery reporting unit for purposes of assessing impairment under fasb guidance on goodwill and other intangibles asc 
management has identified power delivery as a single reporting unit based on the aggregation of components which have similar economic characteristics  similar products and services and operate in a similar regulatory environment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
management uses its best judgment to make reasonable projections of future cash flows for power delivery when estimating the reporting unit s fair value 
in addition  phi selects a discount rate for the associated risk with those estimated cash flows 
these judgments are inherently uncertain  and actual results could vary from those used in phi s estimates 
the impact of such variations could significantly alter the results of a goodwill impairment test  which could materially impact the estimated fair value of power delivery and potentially the amount of any impairment recorded in the financial statements 
phi has historically tested its goodwill for impairment annually as of july from to  and on an interim basis whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
after completion of the july  annual test  phi changed the date of its annual test to november  and accordingly phi has performed its next annual impairment test as of november  factors that may result in an interim impairment test include  but are not limited to a change in identified reporting units  an adverse change in business conditions  a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value  an adverse regulatory action  or impairment of long lived assets in the reporting unit 
phi s november  annual impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired 
see note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements of pepco holdings  set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
phi performed an interim test of goodwill for impairment as of march  which updated an interim test performed as of december  as its market capitalization was below its book value at both points in time and its market capitalization relative to book value had declined significantly from the december  market capitalization 
phi concluded that its goodwill was not impaired at either july   march   or december  although phi s market capitalization remained below book value as of december   phi did not perform an interim goodwill impairment test because its market capitalization relative to book value improved compared to earlier periods and there were no other indicators of potential impairment 

table of contents pepco holdings in order to estimate the fair value of the power delivery reporting unit  phi uses two discounted cash flow models 
the models differ in the method used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit 
one model estimates terminal value based on a constant annual cash flow growth rate that is consistent with power delivery s long term view of the business  and the other model estimates terminal value based on a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda that management believes is consistent with ebitda multiples for comparable utilities 
the models use a cost of capital appropriate for a regulated utility as the discount rate for the estimated cash flows associated with the reporting unit 
phi has consistently used this valuation methodology to estimate the fair value of power delivery 
the estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors that are sourced from the power delivery reporting unit s business forecast  including but not limited to interest rates  growth assumptions  returns on rate base  operating and capital expenditure requirements  and other factors  changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing 
assumptions and methodologies used in the models were consistent with historical experience 
a hypothetical percent decrease in fair value of the power delivery reporting unit at november  would not have resulted in the power delivery reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment test  as defined in the guidance  as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been above its carrying value sensitive  interrelated and uncertain variables that could decrease the estimated fair value of the power delivery reporting unit include utility sector market performance  sustained adverse business conditions  change in forecasted revenues  higher operating and capital expenditure requirements  a significant increase in the cost of capital  and other factors 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because i they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
the primary assets subject to a long lived asset impairment evaluation are property  plant  and equipment 
the fasb guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
an impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco holdings considers historical cash flows 
pepco holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
if necessary  the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill discussed above 

table of contents pepco holdings accounting for derivatives pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent critical accounting estimates because management exercises judgment in the following areas  any of which could have a material impact on its financial statements i the application of the definition of a derivative to contracts to identify derivatives  ii the election of the normal purchases and normal sales exception from derivative accounting  iii the application of cash flow hedge accounting iv the estimation of fair value used in the measurement of derivatives and hedged items  which are highly susceptible to changes in value over time due to market trends or  in certain circumstances  significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value that could result in actual results being materially different from pepco holdings estimates 
see note  significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives and note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in part ii  item of this form k for information on phi s accounting for derivatives 
pepco holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices 
the definition of a derivative in the fasb guidance results in management having to exercise judgment  such as whether there is a notional amount or net settlement provision in contracts 
management assesses a number of factors before determining whether it can designate derivatives for the normal purchase or normal sale exception from derivative accounting  including whether it is probable that the contracts will physically settle with delivery of the underlying commodity 
the application of cash flow hedge accounting often requires judgment in the prospective and retrospective assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness as well as whether it is probable that the forecasted transaction will occur 
the fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available 
for instruments that are not traded on an exchange  external broker quotes are used to determine fair value 
internal models use market information when external broker quotes are not available for some custom and complex instruments 
for certain long dated instruments  broker or exchange data is extrapolated for future periods where limited market information is available 
models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions 
the same valuation methods are used for risk management purposes to determine the value of non derivative  commodity exposure 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because i they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  ii they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and iii changes in assumptions could impact pepco holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  and the reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement 
assumptions about the future  including the expected return on plan assets  discount rate applied to benefit obligations  the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs 
in terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in the critical assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant  pepco holdings estimates that a 
decrease in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a million increase in net periodic benefit cost 
additionally  pepco holdings estimates that a 
reduction in the expected return on plan assets could result in a million increase in net periodic benefit cost 
a increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a million increase net periodic benefit cost 
in addition to its impact on cost  a 
decrease in the discount rate would increase phi s projected pension benefit obligation by million and would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit 
table of contents pepco holdings obligation by million at december  pepco holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions  and benchmarks its critical assumptions against other corporate plans 
the impact of changes in assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of income 
for additional discussion  see note  pensions and other postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
accounting for regulated activities fasb guidance on the accounting for regulated activities applies to the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl  and ace and can result in the deferral of costs or revenue that would otherwise be recognized by non regulated entities 
phi defers the recognition of costs and records regulatory assets when it is probable those costs will be recovered in future rates charged to its customers 
phi defers the recognition of revenues and records regulatory liabilities when it is probable that it will refund payments received from customers in the future or that it will incur future costs related to the payments currently received from customers 
pepco holdings believes that the judgments involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because i management must interpret laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of costs from customers or the return of revenues to customers when determining whether those costs or revenues should be deferred  ii decisions made by regulatory commissions or legislative changes at a later date could vary from earlier interpretations made by management and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii writing off a regulatory asset because deferred costs are no longer probable of recovery in future rates charged to customers could have a material negative impact on pepco holdings assets and earnings 
management s most significant judgment is whether to defer costs or revenues when there is not a current regulatory order specific to the item being considered for deferral 
in those cases  management considers relevant historical precedents of the regulatory commissions  the results of recent rate orders  and any new information from its more current interactions with the regulatory commissions on that item 
management regularly reviews its regulatory assets and liabilities to determine whether adjustments to its previous conclusions are necessary based on the current regulatory and legislative environment as well as recent rate orders 
unbilled revenue unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by pepco holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed 
pepco holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology 
the calculation is based on the supply of electricity or gas distributed to customers but not yet billed and adjusted for estimated line loss 
pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent critical accounting estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors to the unbilled revenue calculation 
specifically  the determination of estimated line loss is inherently uncertain 
estimated line loss is defined as the estimates of electricity and gas expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers 
a change in estimated line loss can change the output available for sale which is a factor in the unbilled revenue calculation 
certain factors can influence the estimated line loss such as seasonality and a change in customer mix 
these factors may vary between companies due to geography and density of service territory and the impact of changes in these factors could be material 
the risk of misstatement in the unbilled revenue calculation is mitigated through corroboration of the resultant unbilled revenue with historical information and other available metrics 

table of contents pepco holdings accounting for income taxes pepco holdings exercises significant judgment about the outcome of income tax matters in its application of the fasb guidance on accounting for income taxes and believes it represents a critical accounting estimate because it records a current tax liability for estimated current tax expense on its federal and state tax returns  it records deferred tax assets for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are more likely than not going to result in tax deductions in future years  it determines whether a valuation allowance is needed against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the future tax deductions will not be realized  it records deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities if it is more likely than not that they are expected to result in tax payments in future years  the measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities requires it to estimate future effective tax rates and future taxable income on its federal and state tax returns  it must consider the effect of newly enacted tax law on its estimated effective tax rate and in measuring deferred tax balances  it asserts that tax positions in its tax returns or expected to be taken in its tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained assuming that the tax positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements and that the benefit recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized 
assumptions  judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for current and deferred income taxes and the associated current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
pepco holdings assumptions  judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws and regulations  interpretation of current tax laws and regulations  the impact of newly enacted tax laws and regulations  developments in case law  settlements of tax positions  and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities 
pepco holdings has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although pepco holdings believes that these assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws and regulations or its interpretation of tax laws and regulations as well as the resolutions of the current and any future investigations or legal proceedings could significantly impact the financial results from applying the accounting for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
pepco holdings reviews its application of the more likely than not standard quarterly 
pepco holdings also evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented  if necessary  to realize deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets and the amount of any associated valuation allowance 
the forecast of future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors that can change over time  including growth assumptions  business conditions  returns on rate base  operating and capital expenditures  cost of capital  tax laws and regulations  the legal structure of entities and other factors  which could materially impact the realizability of deferred tax assets and the associated financial results in the consolidated financial statements

table of contents pepco management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potomac electric power company pepco meets the conditions set forth in general instruction i a and b of form k  and accordingly information otherwise required under this item has been omitted in accordance with general instruction i a to the form k 
general overview potomac electric power company pepco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in the district of columbia and major portions of montgomery county and prince george s county in suburban maryland 
pepco also provides default electricity supply  which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier 
default electricity supply is known as standard offer service in both the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco s service territory covers approximately square miles and has a population of approximately million 
as of december   approximately of delivered electricity sales were to maryland customers and approximately were to the district of columbia customers 
effective june  the maryland public service commission mpsc approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers 
the district of columbia public service commission dcpsc also approved a bsa for retail customers  effective in november for customers to whom the bsa applies  pepco recognizes distribution revenue based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in maryland and the district of columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
for customers to whom the bsa applies  changes in customer usage such as due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue 
as a result of the bsa in maryland and the district of columbia  a revenue decoupling adjustment is recorded representing either a a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from maryland and district of columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that pepco is entitled to earn based on the distribution charge per customer approved in the maryland rate order and the dcpsc order approving a bsa for pepco in the district of columbia effective november  or b a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer

table of contents pepco the aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by an increase of million as the result of higher default electricity supply rates 
the following table shows the percentages of pepco s total distribution sales by jurisdiction that are derived from customers receiving default electricity supply from pepco 
amounts are for the year ended december sales to district of columbia customers sales to maryland customers operating expenses purchased energy purchased energy consists of the cost of electricity purchased by pepco to fulfill its default electricity supply obligation and  as such  is recoverable from customers in accordance with the terms of public service commission orders 
purchased energy decreased by million to  million in from  million in primarily due to a decrease of million which is matched by a corresponding decrease in other regulated t d electric revenue due to the transfer of the panda ppa 
a decrease of million primarily due to commercial customer migration to competitive suppliers 
a decrease of million due to lower average electricity costs under default electricity supply contracts 
a decrease of million due to lower electricity sales as a result of milder weather primarily during the summer months as compared to the aggregate amount of these decreases was partially offset by an increase of million due to a higher rate of recovery of electricity supply costs resulting in a decrease in the default electricity supply deferral balance 
other operation and maintenance other operation and maintenance increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related costs  primarily due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
an increase of million primarily due to higher preventative and corrective maintenance costs 
an increase of million in regulatory expenses primarily incurred in connection with the district of columbia distribution rate case 
an increase of million due to higher non deferrable bad debt expenses 

table of contents pepco during  pepco recorded adjustments to correct errors in other operation and maintenance expenses for prior periods dating back to february during which i customer late payment fees were incorrectly recognized and ii stock based compensation expense related to certain restricted stock awards granted under the long term incentive plan was understated 
these adjustments resulted in a total increase in other operation and maintenance expenses for the year ended december  of million 
these adjustments were not considered material either individually or in the aggregate 
other taxes other taxes increased by million to million in from million in the increase which is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in regulated t d electric revenue was primarily due to increased pass throughs resulting from rate increases in utility taxes imposed by the taxing jurisdictions 
effect of settlement of mirant bankruptcy claims in september  pepco transferred the panda ppa to an unaffiliated third party 
in march  the district of columbia public service commission approved an allocation between pepco and its district of columbia customers of the district of columbia portion of the mirant corporation mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the panda ppa 
as a result  pepco recorded a pre tax gain of million reflecting the district of columbia proceeds retained by pepco 
in july  mpsc approved an allocation between pepco and its maryland customers of the maryland portion of the mirant bankruptcy settlement proceeds remaining after the transfer of the panda ppa 
as a result  pepco recorded a pre tax gain of million reflecting the maryland proceeds retained by pepco 
other income expenses other expenses which are net of other income increased by million to a net expense of million in from a net expense of million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense on long term debt as the result of a higher amount of outstanding debt 
income tax expense pepco s effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in the rate primarily resulted from the change in estimates and interest related to uncertain tax positions which was the result of the reduction in previously accrued interest and estimates resulting from the tentative settlement of the mixed service cost issue 
also contributing to the increase in the rate was the benefit recorded for interest received on the state income tax refund 
capital requirements sources of capital pepco has a range of capital sources available  in addition to internally generated funds  to meet its long term and short term funding needs

for customers to whom the bsa applies  dpl recognizes distribution revenue based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  this has the effect of decoupling distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue in maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
for customers to whom the bsa applies  changes in customer usage such as due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies for phi and its subsidiaries are determined by phi s corporate risk management committee  the members of which are phi s chief risk officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  general counsel  chief information officer and other senior executives 
the corporate risk management committee monitors interest rate fluctuation  commodity price fluctuation  and credit risk exposure  and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements 
for information about phi s derivative activities  other than the information disclosed herein  refer to note  significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives and note  derivative instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
pepco holdings  inc commodity price risk the competitive energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations 
certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives based on fasb guidance on derivatives and hedging asc 
the competitive energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives 
the competitive energy segments primary risk management objectives are to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation facilities and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those facilities by selling forward a portion of their projected plant output and buying forward a portion of their projected fuel supply requirements and to manage the spread between wholesale and retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available 
phi s risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the corporate risk management committee  which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the competitive energy business energy market participation 
phi collectively refers to these energy market activities  including its commodity risk management activities  as energy commodity activities 
phi uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its competitive energy segments energy commodity activities 
phi also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities  including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits 
var represents the potential fair value loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level 
in january  phi changed its var estimation model from a delta normal variance covariance model to a delta gamma model 
the other parameters  a percent  one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period  remained the same 
since var is an estimate  it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
the table below provides the var associated with energy contracts for the year ended december  in millions of dollars var for competitive energy commodity activity a confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed period end average for the period high low a this column represents all energy derivative contracts  normal purchase and normal sales contracts  modeled generation output and fuel requirements  and modeled customer load obligations for phi s energy commodity activities 

table of contents conectiv energy economically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change 
economic hedges include the estimated electricity output of conectiv energy s generating facilities and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges  other derivative instruments  wholesale normal purchase and normal sales contracts  and default electricity supply contracts 
conectiv energy maintains a forward month program for economically hedging its projected plant output combined with its energy purchase commitments 
during the fourth quarter of  conectiv energy transitioned to the use of dynamic spread option models to capture the value of its generation portfolio 
the model computes the probability of run time derived from forward market prices for power and fuel  and then computes the desired hedge positions  over the next months 
conectiv executes power and fuel hedges according to the model s projections based on forward market prices and volatilities 
the primary purpose of the risk management program is to improve the predictability and stability of margins by selling forward a portion of projected plant output  and buying forward a matched portion of projected fuel supply requirements 
not all of the value associated with conectiv energy s generation activities can be hedged such as the portion attributable to ancillary services and fuel switching due to the lack of market products  market liquidity  and other factors 
also  the hedging of locational value can be limited due to market liquidity 
since the inception of the reliability pricing model rpm in pjm  conectiv energy has taken steps to ensure a reasonable return on its generation capacity 
prior to the commencement of the first rpm auction for the pjm planning year  conectiv energy sold a portion of its capacity forward into the over the counter market 
conectiv energy continues to sell some of its capacity into the forward market when it believes prices are favorable 
conectiv energy also reserves some of its capacity to serve full requirements load within pjm 
conectiv energy recovers the value of this capacity by including it in the price offered for the bundled load service in individual load auctions 
pepco energy services purchases electric and natural gas futures  swaps  options and forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for delivery to customers 
pepco energy services accounts for its futures and swap contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
its options contracts and certain commodity contracts that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are marked to market through current earnings 
its forward contracts are accounted for using standard accrual accounting since these contracts meet the requirements for normal purchase and normal sale accounting under fasb guidance on derivatives and hedging 

table of contents credit and nonperformance risk pepco holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through  among other things  formal credit policies  regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty  monitoring procedures that include stress testing  the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  and have established reserves for credit losses 
as of december   credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted with investment grade counterparties  with counterparties without external credit quality ratings  and with non investment grade counterparties 
the following table provides information on the competitive energy business credit exposure on competitive wholesale energy contracts  net of collateral  to wholesale counterparties as of december   in millions of dollars 
rating a exposure before credit collateral b credit collateral c net exposure number of counterparties greater than d net exposure of counterparties greater than investment grade non investment grade no external ratings credit reserves a investment grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty 
if the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity eg  its parent  it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor 
included in investment grade are counterparties with a minimum standard poor s or moody s investor service rating of bbb or baa  respectively 
b exposure before credit collateral includes the marked to market mtm energy contract net assets for open unrealized transactions  the net receivable payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to mtm 
amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place 
thus  this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting  but before considering collateral held 
c credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits  letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties  not adjusted for probability of default  and  if applicable  property interests including oil and gas reserves
