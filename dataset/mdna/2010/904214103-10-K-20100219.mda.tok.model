executive overview umpqua s results reflect the continued effects of the us recession  the housing market downturn and declining real estate values 
the economic environment has adversely affected our residential development  commercial real estate  commercial construction and commercial loan portfolios  with the following results non performing assets increased to million  or of total assets  as of december   compared to million  or of total assets as of december  non performing loans increased to million  or of total loans  as of december   compared to million  or of total loans as of december  non accrual loans have been written down to their estimated net realizable values 
net charge offs were million in  or of average loans and leases  as compared to net charge offs of million  or of average loans and leases in the increase in and write down of impaired loans in the current year has contributed to the increase in net charge offs 
downgrades within the loan portfolio and net charge offs in contributed to a million provision for loan and lease losses in  as compared to million in however  the past year was not without some significant accomplishments 
during the year  we raised million through a public offering by issuing  shares of common stock 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  net proceeds to the company were million 
the proceeds from the offering qualify as tier capital and will be used for general corporate purposes  which include capital to support growth and acquisition opportunities and to position us for redemption of our series a preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
increased our total risk based capital ratio to as of december   compared to as of december   primarily due to the successful public stock offering completed in august mortgage banking revenue was million in  compared to million in closed mortgage volume increased in the current year due to a significant increase in purchase and refinancing activity  resulting from historically low mortgage interest rates 
additionally  the prior period s revenue includes a million charge on an ineffective mortgage servicing right msr hedge  which was suspended  due to widening spreads and price declines that were not offset by a corresponding gain in the related msr asset 
opened a new commercial banking center in lynnwood  washington  and community banking stores in portland  oregon and vancouver  washington 
opened our new international banking division in san francisco  california to serve the financing needs of small and middle market companies involved in international trade 
entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the fdic on january   to assume at no premium the insured  non brokered deposit balances  which totaled million  and certain other assets  of the bank of clark county in vancouver  washington  adding two new stores in vancouver  washington 
also during the year net loss per diluted common share was in  as compared to net earnings of per diluted common share earned in the decline in net earnings per diluted common share is principally attributed 
table of contents to a goodwill impairment charge  increased provision for loan and lease losses  losses incurred on other real estate owned  and interest reversals on loans 
operating loss per diluted common share  defined as earnings available to common shareholders before merger related expenses  net of tax  and goodwill impairment divided by the same diluted share total used in determining diluted earnings per common share  was in  as compared to operating income per diluted common share of in operating income per diluted common share is considered a non gaap financial measure 
more information regarding this measurement and reconciliation to the comparable gaap measurement is provided under the heading results of operations overview below 
net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased to in from in the increase in net interest margin resulted from a decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits  partially offset by reductions in earning asset yields due primarily to a lower prime rate during the current year as compared to the prior year 
excluding a million reversal of interest income on loans in  the tax equivalent net interest margin would have been 
we recorded gains of million in the income statement representing the change in fair value on our junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value in  compared to gains of million in the change in fair value recognized in the current period primarily resulted from the widening of credit risk adjusted rate spreads above the company s contractual spreads 
net loss on investment securities of million in includes other than temporary impairment otti charges of million  which primarily relate to non agency collateralized mortgage obligations 
the impairment charge was offset by gains on the sale of securities of million 
fdic assessments increased to million in  as compared to million the increase results from an industry wide increase in assessment rates and a million special assessment incurred in the second quarter of imposed by the fdic in efforts to rebuild the deposit insurance fund 
gross loans and leases decreased to billion as of december   a decrease of million  or  as compared to december  this decrease is principally attributable to charge offs of million and transfers to other real estate owned of million  offset by net loan originations of million during the year 
total deposits were billion as of december   an increase of million  or  as compared to december  excluding the deposits acquired through the fdic assisted purchase and assumption of the bank of clark county  the organic deposit growth rate was annualized 
total consolidated assets were billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   representing an increase of million or 
the growth in total assets is principally attributable to the increase in deposits and the proceeds received from the public offering of common stock in the third quarter of declared cash dividends of per common share for each quarter in in determining the amount of dividends to be paid  we consider capital preservation  expected asset growth  projected earnings and our overall dividend pay out ratio 
summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
not all of these critical accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the bank performs regular credit reviews of the loan and lease portfolio to determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards 
when loans and leases are originated  they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process 
the company s risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from to  where a higher rating represents higher risk 
the risk rating categories are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank has a management allowance for loan and lease losses alll committee  which is responsible for  among other things  regularly reviewing the alll methodology  including loss factors  and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the alll committee reviews and approves loans and leases recommended for impaired status 
the alll committee also approves removing loans and leases from impaired status 
the bank s audit and compliance committee provides board oversight of the alll process and reviews and approves the alll methodology on a quarterly basis 
each risk rating is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses provided for that group of loans and leases with similar risk rating 
credit loss factors may vary by region based on management s belief that there may ultimately be different credit loss rates experienced in each region 
regular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired 
potentially impaired loans are referred to the alll committee which reviews and approves designated loans as impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events  we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
if we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we either recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses or charge off the impaired balance on collateral dependent loans if it is determined that such amount represents a confirmed loss 
the combination of the risk rating based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank may also maintain an unallocated allowance amount to provide for other credit losses inherent in a loan and lease portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the credit loss factors 
this unallocated amount generally comprises less than of the allowance  but may be maintained at higher levels during times of deteriorating economic conditions characterized by falling real estate values 
the unallocated amount is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses  the results of credit reviews and overall economic trends 
as of december   the unallocated allowance amount represented of the allowance 
the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds  such as with a letter or line of credit 
the adequacy of the alll and ruc are monitored on a regular basis and are based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience  and other pertinent information 
management believes that the alll was adequate as of december  there is  however  no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the alll and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 
approximately of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  and a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the us recession  the housing market downturn  and declining real estate values in our markets have negatively impacted aspects of our residential development  commercial real estate  commercial construction and commercial loan portfolios  and have led to an increase in non performing loans and the 
table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses 
a continued deterioration in our markets may adversely affect our loan portfolio and may lead to additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
mortgage servicing rights in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  transfers and servicing  the company determines its classes of servicing assets based on the asset type being serviced along with the methods used to manage the risk inherent in the servicing assets  which includes the market inputs used to value the servicing assets 
the company elected to measure its residential mortgage servicing assets at fair value and to report changes in fair value through earnings 
fair value adjustments encompass market driven valuation changes and the runoff in value that occurs from the passage of time  which are separately reported 
under the fair value method  the msr is carried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in earnings under the caption mortgage banking revenue in the period in which the change occurs 
retained mortgage servicing rights are measured at fair value as of the date of sale 
we use quoted market prices when available 
subsequent fair value measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
in order to determine the fair value of the msr  the present value of expected future cash flows is estimated 
assumptions used include market discount rates  anticipated prepayment speeds  delinquency and foreclosure rates  and ancillary fee income 
this model is periodically validated by an independent external model validation group 
the model assumptions and the msr fair value estimates are also compared to observable trades of similar portfolios as well as to msr broker valuations and industry surveys  as available 
the expected life of the loan can vary from management s estimates due to prepayments by borrowers  especially when rates fall 
prepayments in excess of management s estimates would negatively impact the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the mortgage servicing rights is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model  which we base on current market rates 
management reviews this rate on an ongoing basis based on current market rates 
a significant increase in the discount rate would reduce the value of mortgage servicing rights

valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   we had million in goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of business combinations 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of december additionally  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated on an interim basis when events or circumstance indicate impairment potentially exists 
as a result of the year end analysis in  management determined that there was a million impairment related to the retail brokerage reporting segment as of december   which resulted from the company s evaluation following the departure of certain umpqua investments financial advisors 
the valuation of the impairment at the retail brokerage operating segment was determined using an income approach by discounting cash flows of forecasted earnings 
the remaining balance of goodwill and other intangible assets relate to the community banking reporting segment 
the company performed a goodwill impairment analysis of the community banking reporting segment as of june   due to a further decline in the company s market capitalization below the book value of equity and continued weakness in the banking industry 
the company engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist us in determining whether our goodwill asset was impaired 
the valuation of the reporting unit was determined using discounted cash flows of forecasted earnings  estimated sales price multiples based on recent observable market transactions and market capitalization based on current stock price 
the results of the company s and valuation specialist s step one test indicated that the reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying value  and therefore the company performed a step two analysis 
in the step two analysis  we calculated the fair value for the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  as well as its unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  such as the core deposit intangible and trade name  in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
fair value adjustments to items on the balance sheet primarily related to investment securities held to maturity  loans  other real estate owned  visa class b common stock  deferred taxes  deposits  term debt  and junior subordinated debentures 
based on the results of the step two analysis  the company determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill was greater than its carrying amount on the company s balance sheet  and as a result  recognized a goodwill 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation impairment loss of million 
this write down of goodwill is a non cash charge that does not affect the company s or the bank s liquidity or operations 
in addition  because goodwill is excluded in the calculation of regulatory capital  the company s well capitalized capital ratios were not affected by this charge 
the company evaluated the community banking reporting segment as of december  in the first step of the goodwill impairment test the company determined that the fair value of the community banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
this determination is consistent with the events occurring after the company recognized the million impairment of goodwill second quarter of first  the market capitalization and estimated fair value of the company increased significantly subsequent to the recognition of the impairment charge as the fair value of the company s stock increased from june  to december  secondly  the company s successful public common stock offering in the third quarter of diluted the carrying value of the reporting unit s book equity on a per share basis  based upon which the fair value of the reporting unit is measured 
the impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions 
there can be no assurance that changes in circumstances  estimates or assumption will not result in additional impairment of all  or some portion of  goodwill 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation consistent with the provisions of fasb asc  stock compensation  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation  we recognize expense for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology  and ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb revised fasb asc  business combinations 
fasb asc establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity and the goodwill acquired 
furthermore  acquisition related and other costs will now be expensed rather than treated as cost components of the acquisition 
fasb asc also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the revision to this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after january  the adoption of these revisions will increase the costs charged to operations for acquisitions consummated on or after january  
table of contents in december  fasb amended fasb asc  consolidation 
this amendment establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the standard also requires additional disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent s owners and the interest of the noncontrolling owners of the subsidiary 
this statement is effective on january  for the company  to be applied prospectively 
the impact of adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  fasb amended fasb asc  earnings per share 
this amendment concluded that nonvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two class method 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   to be applied retrospectively 
certain of the company s nonvested restricted stock awards qualify as participating securities as described under this amendment 
the adoption of this provision reduced both basic and diluted earnings per common share by for the year ended december  in january  fasb amended fasb asc  investments other 
this amendment addressed certain practice issues related to the recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  by making its other than temporary impairment otti assessment guidance consistent with fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities 
the amendment removes the reference to the consideration of a market participant s estimates of cash flows and instead requires an assessment of whether it is probable  based on current information and events  that the holder of the security will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
if it is probable that there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows  an otti is deemed to exist  and a corresponding loss shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s carrying value and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made 
this amendment became effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december   and is applied prospectively 
the impact of adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  fasb amended fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  to address issues related to the determination of fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased  and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the revisions affirm the objective that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction that is not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions  even if the market is inactive 
the amendment provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have decreased significantly 
it also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
if determined that a quoted price is distressed not orderly  and thereby not representative of fair value  the entity may need to make adjustments to the quoted price or utilize an alternative valuation technique eg income approach or multiple valuation techniques to determine fair value 
additionally  an entity must incorporate appropriate risk premium adjustments  reflective of an orderly transaction under current market conditions  due to uncertainty in cash flows 
the revised guidance requires disclosures in interim and annual periods regarding the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques and related inputs  if any  during the period 
it also requires financial institutions to disclose the fair values of investment securities by major security type 
the changes are effective for the interim reporting period ending after june   and are to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of these amendments impacted the company s determination of fair value related to our junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value 
as of march   prior to the adoption of these amendments  we discounted these liabilities by the current three month libor plus a credit risk adjusted spread of basis points 
due to the lack of observable  orderly transactions  of either new issuances or trades  we estimated that a market participant would utilize a credit risk adjusted spread of basis points if an actual market transaction in an active market were to take place for an entity with comparable nonperformance risk 
the amendments clarify that a fair value measurement shall assume a risk premium market participants would require at a measurement date under current market conditions  even if the market is inactive 
with the assistance of a third party pricing service  we determined that a credit risk adjusted spread of basis points would be representative of the nonperformance risk premium a market participant would require under current market conditions as of june  in accordance with the guidance  this is accounted for as a change in accounting 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation estimate 
this increase in the credit risk adjusted spread is the primary factor resulting in the million gain on junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value recognized in the second quarter of at december   we continue to estimate that the credit risk adjusted spread of basis points is appropriate 
the change in junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value in the third and fourth quarters of is attributable to changes in three month libor and quarterly interest payments  and would have generally been recognized under both methodologies 
the effect of these amendments did not have a significant impact on the fair value measurement of any other assets or liabilities 
in april  fasb revised fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities  to change the otti model for debt securities 
previously  an entity was required to assess whether it has the intent and ability to hold a security to recovery in determining whether an impairment of that security is other than temporary 
if the impairment was deemed other than temporarily impaired  the investment was written down to fair value through earnings 
under the revised guidance  otti is triggered if an entity has the intent to sell the security  it is likely that it will be required to sell the security before recovery  or if the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
if the entity intends to sell the security or it is likely it will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis  the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings as an otti 
if the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not likely that the entity will be required to sell the security but the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings as an otti 
the credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected of a security 
projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential otti 
the remaining impairment loss related to all other factors  the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and fair value  would be recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income oci 
impairment losses related to all other factors are to be presented as a separate category within oci 
for investment securities held to maturity  this amount is accreted over the remaining life of the debt security prospectively based on the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows 
the accretion of the otti amount recorded in oci will increase the carrying value of the investment  and would not affect earnings 
if there is an indication of additional credit losses the security is re evaluated accordingly based on the procedures described above 
upon adoption of the revised guidance  the noncredit portion of previously recognized otti shall be reclassified to accumulated oci by a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
these revisions became effective in the interim reporting period ending after june  upon adoption of this guidance the company analyzed the securities for which otti had been previously recognized and determined that as of the adoption date such losses were credit related 
as such  there was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or a corresponding adjustment to accumulated oci 
in april  fasb revised fasb asc  financial instruments  to require fair value disclosures in the notes of an entity s interim financial statements for all financial instruments  whether or not recognized in the statement of financial position 
this revision became effective for the interim reporting period ending after june  the adoption of the revised increased interim financial statement disclosures and did not impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  fasb amended fasb asc  subsequent events 
the updated guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the revisions should not result in significant changes in the subsequent events that an entity reports  either through recognition or disclosure in its financial statements 
it does require disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance for the interim period ended june   and the impact of adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued asu no 
 transfers and servicing topic accounting for transfers of financial assets 
this update codifies sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which was previously issued by fasb in june but was not included in the original codification 
asu eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a 
table of contents portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies other sale accounting criteria  and changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets 
this statement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november   and for interim periods therein 
this standard will primarily impact the company s accounting and reporting of transfers representing a portion of a financial asset for which the company has a continuing involvement  generally known as loan participations 
in order to recognize the transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  the transferred portion and any portion that continues to be held by the transferor must represent a participating interest  and the transfer of the participating interest must meet the conditions for surrender of control 
to qualify as a participating interest i the portions of a financial asset must represent a proportionate ownership interest in an entire financial asset  ii from the date of transfer  all cash flows received from the entire financial asset must be divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership  iii involve no recourse other than standard representation and warranties to  or subordination by  any participating interest holder  and iv no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset 
if the participating interest or surrender of control criteria are not met the transfer is not accounted for as a sale and derecognition of the asset is not appropriate 
rather the transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing arrangement 
the impact of certain participations being reported as secured borrowings rather than derecognizing a portion of a financial asset would increase total assets loans  liabilities term debt and their respective interest income and expense 
an increase in total assets also increases regulatory risk weighted assets and could negatively impact our capital ratios 
the company is reviewing our participation agreements to ensure new originations meet the criteria to allow for sale accounting in order to limit the impact upon our financial statements 
the terms contained in certain participation and loan sale agreements  however  are outside the control of the company 
these arrangements largely relate to small business administration sba loan sales 
these sales agreements contain recourse provisions generally days that will initially preclude sale accounting 
however  once the recourse provision expires  transfers of portions of financial assets may be reevaluated to determine if they meet the participating interest definition 
as a result  we expect to report sba and potentially certain other transfers of financial assets as secured borrowings which will defer the gain of sale on these transactions  at least until the recourse provision expires  assuming all other sales criteria for each transaction are met 
the company does not believe it has or will have a significant amount of participations subject to recourse provisions or other features that would preclude derecognition of the assets transferred 
the company does not believe the impact of adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued asu no 
 consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
this update codifies sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which was previously issued by fasb in june but was not included in the original codification 
asu eliminates fasb interpretations r fin r exceptions to consolidating qualifying special purpose entities  contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary  and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
under the revised guidance  the primary beneficiary of a vie party who must consolidate the vie is the enterprise that has i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie  or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
asu also contains a new requirement that any term  transaction  or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity s status as a variable interest entity  a company s power over a variable interest entity  or a company s obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying fin r provisions 
the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and its consolidation exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments 
this statement requires additional disclosures regarding an entity s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this statement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november   and for interim periods therein 
the company has evaluated the impact of this guidance in regards to our involvement with variable interest entities 
this guidance potentially impacts the accounting for our limited partnership equity investments in affordable housing development funds and real estate investment funds 
in regards to affordable housing investments  the primary activities that most significantly impacts the vie s economic performance include leasing rental units at appropriate rent rates in compliance with low income housing restrictions and requirements  operating the rental property thereby generating income loss from the partnership operations  and protecting the low income housing tax credits from recapture 
as a limited partner  the company 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation generally does not participate in the control of the partnerships business  our involvement is limited to providing a stated amount of financial support commitment or subscription as stated within contractual agreements  and the primary purpose of the investment is to receive the tax attributes tax credits of the partnership 
the general partner  which generally are a developer or non profit organization  exercise the day to day control and management of the partnerships that most significantly impacts the vie s economic performance 
in regards to the real estate investment funds  the primary activities that most significantly impacts the vie s economic performance include the development  financing  and leasing of real estate related properties  and ultimately finding a profitable exit from such investments 
the company s involvement in these funds are limited minority interest partners 
according to the terms of the partnerships  the general partners have exclusive control to manage the enterprise and power to direct activities that impact the vie s economic performance 
the impact of adoption did not result in the company consolidating or deconsolidating any variable interest entities as accounted for under previous guidance and  therefore  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  fasb codified fasb asc  generally accepted accounting principles  to establish the fasb asc the codification 
the codification is not expected to change us gaap  but combines all authoritative standards into a comprehensive  topically organized online database 
following this guidance  the financial accounting standards board will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standards updates asu to update the codification 
after the launch of the codification on july  only one level of authoritative us gaap for non governmental entities will exist  other than guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission 
this statement is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september  the adoption of the fasb asc did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  and only affects how the company s references authoritative accounting guidance going forward 
in august  the fasb issued asu no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value 
this update amends fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosure  in regards to the fair value measurement of liabilities 
fasb asc clarifies that in circumstances in which a quoted price for a identical liability in an active market in not available  a reporting entity shall utilize one or more of the following techniques i the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  ii the quoted price for a similar liability or a similar liability when traded as an asset  or iii another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fasb asc in all instances a reporting entity shall utilize the approach that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs 
also  when measuring the fair value of a liability a reporting entity shall not include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
this update is effective for the company in the fourth quarter of this update primarily affects our considerations related to our measurement of junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value 
the adoption of fasb asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
fasb asu no 
requires i fair value disclosures by each class of assets and liabilities generally a subset within a line item as presented in the statement of financial position rather than major category  ii for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the amounts of significant transfers between levels and  and transfers into and out of level  and the reasons for those transfers  including separate discussion related to the transfers into each level apart from transfers out of each level  and iii gross presentation of the amounts of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the level recurring measurement reconciliation

table of contents results of operations overview for the year ended december   net loss available to common shareholders was million  or per diluted common share  as compared to net earnings available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted common share for the year ended december  the decrease in net earnings available to common shareholders in is principally attributable to increased provision for loan and lease losses  decreased non interest income  increased non interest expense and increased preferred stock dividends  partially offset by increased net interest income 
non interest expense in the year ended december  includes a goodwill impairment charge recognized in the second quarter of million related to the community banking operating segment 
we assumed the insured non brokered deposit balances and certain other assets of the bank of clark county on january  and the results of the acquired operations are included in our financial results starting on january  for the year ended december   net earnings available to common shareholders was million  or per diluted common share  a decrease of on a per diluted common share basis compared to the decrease in net earnings available to common shareholders in is principally attributable to increased provision for loan and lease losses and non interest expense  partially offset by increased net interest and non interest income 
we completed the acquisition of north bay bancorp on april   and the results of the acquired operations are included in our financial results starting on april  we incur significant expenses related to the completion and integration of mergers 
additionally  we may recognize goodwill impairment losses that have no effect on the company s or the bank s cash balances  liquidity  or regulatory capital ratios 
accordingly  we believe that our operating results are best measured on a comparative basis excluding the impact of merger related expenses  net of tax  and other charges related to business combinations such as goodwill impairment charges 
we define operating income as earnings available to common shareholders before merger related expenses  net of tax  and goodwill impairment  and we calculate operating income per diluted share by dividing operating income by the same diluted share total used in determining diluted earnings per common share see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
operating income and operating income per diluted share are considered non gaap financial measures 
although we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides a better indication of our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
the following table presents a reconciliation of operating loss income and operating loss income per diluted share to net loss earnings and net loss earnings per diluted common share for years ended december   and reconciliation of operating loss income to net loss earnings available to common shareholders years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net loss earnings available to common shareholders merger related expenses  net of tax goodwill impairment operating loss income per diluted common share net loss earnings available to common shareholders merger related expenses  net of tax goodwill impairment operating loss income 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation the following table presents the returns on average assets  average common shareholders equity and average tangible common shareholders equity for the years ended december   and for each of the years presented  the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net loss earnings available to common shareholders and operating loss income as shown in the table above 
our return on average common shareholders equity is negatively impacted as a result of capital required to support goodwill 
to the extent this performance metric is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger related intangible assets  we believe it beneficial to also consider the return on average common tangible shareholders equity 
the return on average common tangible shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net loss earnings available to common shareholders by average common shareholders common equity less average goodwill and intangible assets  net excluding msrs 
the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders equity

umpqua believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for period to period and company to company comparisons  which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company 
tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less preferred stock and less goodwill and other intangible assets  net excluding msrs 
in addition  tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets  net excluding msrs 
the tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders equity divided by tangible assets 
the tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the total shareholders equity and the total shareholders equity ratio

the increase in net interest income in as compared to is attributable to growth in outstanding average interest earnings assets  primarily loans and leases and investment securities  partially offset by both growth in interest bearing liabilities  primarily money market  time deposits and term debt  and a decrease in net interest margin 
in addition to organic growth  the fdic assisted purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities of the bank of clark county  which was completed on january   partially contributed to the increase in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in over the deposit liabilities assumed from the bank of clark county purchase and assumption transaction totaled million as of the assumption date 
the north bay merger  which was completed on april   contributed to the increase in interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities during the fair value of interest earnings assets acquired as a result of the north bay merger totaled million  and interest bearing liabilities totaled million 
the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earnings assets on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  an increase of basis points as compared to the same period in the increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from the decrease in our interest expense to earning assets of basis points in resulting from the lower costs of interest bearing deposits  and junior subordinated debentures that are indexed to the three month libor 
this was partially offset by the decreased yield on interest earning assets of basis points primarily resulting from reductions in the prime rate  holding higher interest bearing cash balances with the federal reserve bank at basis points  and interest reversals on loans 
the increased interest bearing cash balances result from the historically low yields available in the bond

the net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  a decrease of basis points as compared to the same period in the decrease in net interest margin in resulted from decreases in market index rates  such as prime and the fed funds rates  and interest reversals on loans 
the decreased yield on interest earnings assets of basis points in primarily resulted from reductions in the prime rate 
this decline in net interest margin was partially offset by the decrease in our interest expense to earning assets of basis points from the lower costs of interest bearing deposits 
the million reversal of interest income on loans in contributed to a basis point decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin for the year 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in the yields earned on interest earnings assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds

provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses was million for  compared to million for and million for as a percentage of average outstanding loans  the provision for loan losses recorded for was  an increase of basis points and basis points from and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in as compared to and is principally attributable to downgrades within the portfolio related primarily to the housing market downturn and its impact on our residential development and other segments of our portfolio  the us recession and declining real estate values in our markets and the resulting impact on our commercial real estate and commercial construction portfolio  and the increase in loans charged off 
prior to the second quarter of  the company established specific reserves within the allowance for loan and leases losses for loan impairments and recognized the charge off of the impairment reserve when the loan was resolved  sold  or foreclosed and transferred to other real estate owned 
due to declining real estate values in our markets and the deterioration of the us economy in general  it is increasingly likely that impairment reserves on collateral dependent loans  particularly those relating to real estate  will not be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss 
as a result  beginning in the second quarter of  the 
table of contents company began recognizing the charge off of impairment reserves on impaired loans in the period they arise for collateral dependent loans 
this process has effectively accelerated the recognition of charge offs recognized since the second quarter of the change in our assessment of the possible recoverability of our collateral dependent impaired loans carrying values has ultimately had no impact on our impairment valuation procedures or the amount of provision for loan and leases losses included within the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the non accrual loans of million as of december  have already been written down to their estimated fair value  less estimated costs to sell  and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss  absent further decline in market prices 
depending on the characteristics of a loan  the fair value of collateral is estimated by obtaining external appraisals 
the provision for loan and lease losses is based on management s evaluation of inherent risks in the loan portfolio and a corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
additional discussion on loan quality and the allowance for loan and lease losses is provided under the heading asset quality and non performing assets below

the increase in deposit service charges in over is principally attributable to increased volume of deposit accounts during the year 
brokerage commissions and fees declined as a result of the continuation of stressed conditions in the trading market during  relative to the same periods in and  and the departure of certain umpqua investments financial advisors in the fourth quarter of however  brokerage commissions and fees in the second half of increased over the first half of due to the new leadership s ability to recruit new brokers and grow assets under management 
mortgage banking revenue in increased due to a significant increase in purchase and refinancing activity  resulting from historically low mortgage interest rates  as compared closed mortgage volume for was million  representing an increase over production 
the current low mortgage interest rate environment contributed to a million decline in fair value on the mortgage servicing right msr asset in the current year  compared to a million decline in fair

additionally  mortgage banking revenue in the first quarter of reflects a million realized loss on an ineffective msr hedge  which has been suspended  due to widening spreads and price declines that were not offset by a corresponding gain in the related msr asset 
the decrease in mortgage banking revenue in compared to primarily resulted from the difference between the million loss and a  loss on the msr asset between the respective periods  and the million realized loss on an ineffective msr hedge due to significant market volatility in the first quarter of  partially offset by increased fees on loans sold 
the net loss on investment securities recognized in represents an other than temporary impairment otti charge of million  partially offset by the realized gain on sale of investment securities of million 
the otti charge recognized in earnings primarily related to held to maturity non agency collateralized mortgage obligations  and the amount recognized in earnings represents our estimate of the credit loss component of the total impairment 
in  the company realized a million gain on sale of investment securities as part of a repositioning of the investment portfolio to reduce the weighted average life in response to the current economic outlook  and other factors 
this gain was offset by a million otti charge primarily related to held to maturity non agency collateralized mortgage obligations 
additional discussion on the otti charges and gain on sale of investment securities are provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and under the heading investment securities below 
the change in fair value of the junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value for all periods presented primarily resulted from the widening of the credit risk adjusted spread over the contractual rate of each junior subordinated debenture measured at fair value

in the first quarter of visa completed an initial public offering and the company received million as part of a subsequent mandatory partial redemption of our visa class b shares 
as part of this offering  visa also established a billion escrow account to cover settlements  the resolution of pending litigation and related claims covered litigation 
the company s remaining  shares of visa class b common stock are restricted and may not be transferred until the later of three years from the date of the initial public offering or the period of time necessary to resolve the covered litigation 
a conversion ratio of was established for the conversion rate of class b shares into class a shares 
if the funds in the escrow account are insufficient to settle all the covered litigation  visa may sell additional class a shares  use the proceeds to settle litigation  and further reduce the conversion ratio 
if funds remain in the escrow account after all litigation is settled  the class b conversion ratio will be increased to reflect that surplus 
in december  visa deposited additional funds into the escrow account to satisfy a settlement with discover card related to an antitrust lawsuit 
in july  visa deposited additional funds into the litigation escrow account to provide additional reserves to cover potential losses related to the two remaining litigation cases 
the deposit of these funds into the escrow account reduced the conversion ratio applicable to class b common stock outstanding from per class a share to per class a share 
as of december   the value of the class a shares was per share 
the value of unredeemed class a equivalent shares owned by the company was million as of december   and has not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
other income increased in over as a result of compensatory damages awarded to the company and increased income on trading assets invested in trust for the benefit of certain executives or former employees of acquired institutions as required by agreements 
the increase was partially offset by decreased gains and broker fee income related to small business administration loan sales and proceeds from a legal settlement in the first quarter of other income decreased in over largely due to decreased gains and broker fee income related to small business administration sba loan sales  and losses related to trading assets

excluding the incremental impact of the mortgage division s variable costs  non interest expense in over increased million  or  which is less than the growth in total assets during the current year 
excluding these non controllable or infrequently occurring items  non interest expense in over decreased  due to the company s extensive cost control measures that were put in place in reaction to the slowing economy 
of the million increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in compared to  approximately million is a direct result of increased production in our mortgage banking division  and million is a result of reduced loan origination activity related to lower customer demand  resulting in a reduced offset to compensation expense for deferred loan costs 
the remainder primarily results from the increase in employees by full time equivalents in the current year 
the increase in total salaries and employee benefits expense in compared to is primarily a result of reduced loan origination activity  resulting in a reduced offset to compensation expense for deferred loan costs

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation expense continues to increase primarily as a result of the growth in the number of our company s locations 
the growth in reflects the two new banking locations obtained through the fdic assisted purchase and assumption of the bank of clark county in january  the addition of two de novo community banking locations  in portland  oregon and vancouver  washington  and the opening of a new commercial banking center in lynnwood  washington 
in  we opened a new commercial banking center in san francisco  california and a mortgage office in stockton  california 
additionally  in  we remodeled thirty eight stores  primarily locations acquired through acquisitions  to meet umpqua brand standards and customer expectations throughout the california region 
the expense recognized in reflects ten new banking locations as a result of the north bay acquisition in april  and the addition of three de novo banking locations 
the increase in net occupancy and equipment expense in also reflects increased maintenance contract and software amortization costs 
communications  marketing  supplies  and other expenses fluctuated in the current year as a result of normal operations 
services expense increased in compared to primarily due to higher legal and other professional fees 
the decline in communications  marketing  and supplies expense  as well as the modest increase in services expense  in compared to are a result of aggressive cost saving initiatives implemented in late fdic assessments represent premiums payable to the fdic for deposit insurance and financing corporation fico assessments 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of reform act created a new system and rate schedule related to fdic deposit insurance assessments effective in as a result  the company was assessed deposit insurance premiums beginning in  however  most of the premium was offset by a one time assessment credit that was provided to eligible institutions as part of the reform act 
the company s one time deposit insurance assessment credit was fully exhausted in the increase in fdic assessments in compared to prior years is a result of increased deposit insurance assessments rates and no remaining one time assessment credits available to offset the current period expense 
in december and again in february  the fdic adopted rules to further modify the risk based deposit insurance assessment system that increased the assessment rates in attempts to restore the deposit insurance fund to targeted reserve ratios 
the increase in fdic assessment expense in compared to results from the industry wide increase in assessment rates and a million special assessment imposed in the second quarter of by the fdic in efforts to rebuild the deposit insurance fund 
additional discussion on fdic insurance assessments is provided in item business above  under the heading federal deposit insurance 
the continued slowdown in the housing industry  which has detrimentally affected our residential development portfolio  and declines in the fair value of real estate  that serves as collateral securing real estate related credits  has led to an increase of foreclosures on real estate related properties and movement of the properties into other real estate owned oreo 
declines in the market values of these properties after foreclosure have resulted in additional losses on the sale of the properties or by valuation adjustments 
during  the company recognized losses on sale of oreo of million 
the increase in losses on sale of oreo was due to a combination of the continued value compression of real estate properties and our desire to expedite the sale of several properties 
of the total loss on sale of oreo recognized in the  million related to two residential development related properties located in central oregon

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation the mortgage related securities in serial maturities in the table above include both pooled mortgage backed issues and high quality collaterized mortgage obligation structures  with an average duration of years 
these mortgage related securities provide yield spread to us treasury or agency securities  however  the cash flows arising from them can be volatile due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans 
the equity security in other investment securities in the table above at december  principally represents an investment in a community reinvestment act investment fund comprised largely of mortgage related securities  although funds may also invest in municipal bonds  money market accounts or asset backed securities 
we review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti or permanent impairment  taking into consideration current market conditions  fair value in relationship to cost  extent and nature of the change in fair value  issuer rating changes and trends  whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment  which may be maturity  and other factors 
prior to the second quarter of  the company would assess an otti or permanent impairment based on the nature of the decline and whether the company has the ability and intent to hold the investments until a market price recovery 
if the company determined a security to be other than temporarily or permanently impaired  the full amount of impairment would be recognized through earnings in its entirety 
new guidance related to the recognition and presentation of otti of debt securities became effective in the second quarter of rather than asserting whether a company has the ability and intent to hold an investment until a market price recovery  a company must consider whether they intend to sell a security or if it is likely that they would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis of the investment  which may be maturity 
for debt securities  if we intend to sell the security or it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis  the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings as an otti 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings 
the credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected 
projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential otti 
the remaining impairment related to all other factors  the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and fair value  is recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income oci 
impairment losses related to all other factors are presented as separate categories within oci 
for investment securities held to maturity  this amount is accreted over the remaining life of the debt security prospectively based on the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows 
the accretion of the amount recorded in oci increases the carrying value of the investment and does not affect earnings 
if there is an indication of additional credit losses the security is reevaluated accordingly to the procedures described above 
prior to the company s adoption of the new guidance related to the recognition and presentation of otti of debt securities which became effective in the second quarter of  the company recorded a million otti charge in the three months ended march  this charge related to three non agency collateralized mortgage obligations carried as held to maturity for which the default rates and loss severities of the underlying collateral and credit coverage ratios of the security indicated that it was probable that credit losses were expected to occur 
in  the company recorded million in otti 
charges of million related to seven non agency collateralized mortgage obligations carried as held to maturity for which the default rates and loss severities of the underlying collateral and credit coverage ratios of the security indicated that it was probable that credit losses were expected to occur

the remaining non agency securities within mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations carried as held to maturity were specifically evaluated for otti  and the default rates and loss severities of the underlying collateral indicated that credit losses are not expected to occur 
upon adoption of the new otti guidance in the second quarter of  the company analyzed these securities as well as other securities where otti had been previously recognized  and determined that as of the adoption date such losses were credit related 
as such  there was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or a corresponding adjustment to accumulated oci

we estimated the cash flows of the underlying collateral for each security considering credit  interest and prepayment risk models that incorporate management s estimate of projected key assumptions including prepayment rates  collateral default rates and loss severity 
assumptions utilized vary from security to security  and are influenced by factors such as loan interest rates  geographic location  borrower characteristics and vintage  and historical experience 
we then used a third party to obtain information about the structure of each security  including subordination and other credit enhancements  in order to determine how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each security issued in the structure 
these cash flows were then discounted at the interest rate used to recognize interest income on each security 
we reviewed the actual collateral performance of these securities as of december  and noted no significant further deterioration of the underlying mortgages that would significantly impact the inputs or cash flow projections we utilized since the last date these securities were evaluated for impairment

restricted equity securities restricted equity securities were million at december  and million at december  of the million at december   million and million represent the bank s investment in the federal home loan banks fhlb of seattle and san francisco  respectively 
fhlb stock is carried at par and does not have a readily determinable fair value 
ownership of fhlb stock is restricted to the fhlb and member institutions  and can only be purchased and redeemed at par 
the remaining restricted equity securities represent investments in pacific coast bankers bancshares stock 
although as of september   the fhlb of seattle met all of its regulatory requirements including the risk based capital requirement  on november   the finance agency reaffirmed the fhlb of seattle capital classification as undercapitalized 
the finance agency also indicated that it would not change the capital classification to adequately capitalized until the finance agency believes the fhlb of seattle has demonstrated sustained performance in line with an approved capital restoration plan 
management periodically evaluates fhlb stock for other than temporary or permanent impairment 
management s determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value 
the determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of cost is influenced by criteria such as the significance of any decline in net assets of the fhlb as compared to the capital stock amount for the fhlb and the length of time this situation has persisted  commitments by the fhlb to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the fhlb  the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and  accordingly  the customer base of the fhlb  and the liquidity position of the fhlb 
under federal housing finance agency regulations  a fhlb that fails to meet any regulatory capital requirement may not declare a dividend or redeem or repurchase capital stock in excess of what is required for members current loans 
moody s investors service moody s current assessment of the fhlb s portfolios indicates that the true economic losses embedded in these securities are significantly less than the accounting impairments would suggest and are manageable given the fhlb s capital levels 
according to moody s  the large difference between the expected economic losses and the mark to market impairment losses for accounting purposes is attributed to market illiquidity  de leveraging and stress in the credit market in general 
the fhlbs have access to the us government sponsored enterprise credit facility  a secured lending facility that serves as a liquidity backstop  substantially reducing the likelihood that the fhlbs would need to sell securities to raise liquidity and  thereby  cause the realization of large economic losses 
in addition  the federal reserve has begun to purchase direct debt obligations of freddie mac  fannie mae and the fhlbs 
moody s has stated that their aaa senior debt rating and prime short term debt rating for the fhlb system are likely to remain unchanged based on expectations that the fhlbs have a very high degree of government support 
moody s rating of the fhlb of seattle as aaa with stable outlook was reaffirmed in may  and standard and poors rating of aa was reaffirmed in august based on the above  the company has determined there is not an other than temporary impairment on the fhlb stock investment as of december  loans and leases total loans and leases outstanding at december  were billion  a decrease of million  or  from year end this decrease is principally attributable to charge offs of million and transfers to other real estate owned of million  offset by net loan originations of million during the year

asset quality and non performing assets we manage asset quality and control credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices 
the bank s credit quality group is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the bank 
the provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral  and other trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
reviews of non performing  past due loans and larger credits  designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses  and to determine the adequacy of the allowance  are conducted on a quarterly basis 
these reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  loan loss experience  estimated loan losses  growth in the loan portfolio  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is contained in part i item of this report in the section titled lending and credit functions 
non performing loans  which include non accrual loans and accruing loans past due over days  totaled million or of total loans as of december   as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  non performing assets  which include non performing loans and foreclosed real estate other real estate owned  totaled million  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets as of december  the increase in non performing assets in attributable to the effects of the us recession  the housing market downturn and declining real estate values on our loan portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events  we determine it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
generally  when loans 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation are identified as impaired they are moved to our special assets division 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the loan for potential impairment using discount cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of collateral  less selling costs 
the starting point for determining the fair value of collateral is through obtaining external appraisals 
generally  external appraisals are updated every six to nine months 
we obtain appraisals from a pre approved list of independent  third party  local appraisal firms 
approval and addition to the list is based on experience  reputation  character  consistency and knowledge of the respective real estate market 
at a minimum  it is ascertained that the appraiser is a currently licensed in the state in which the property is located  b is experienced in the appraisal of properties similar to the property being appraised  c is actively engaged in the appraisal work  d has knowledge of current real estate market conditions and financing trends  e is reputable  and f is not on freddie mac s nor the bank s exclusionary list of appraisers and brokers 
in certain cases appraisals will be reviewed by our real estate valuation services group to ensure the quality of the appraisal and the expertise and independence of the appraiser 
upon receipt and review  an external appraisal is utilized to measure a loan for potential impairment 
our impairment analysis documents the date of the appraisal used in the analysis  whether the officer preparing the report deems it current  and  if not  allows for internal valuation adjustments with justification 
typical justified adjustments might include discounts for continued market deterioration subsequent to appraisal date  adjustments for the release of collateral contemplated in the appraisal  or the value of other collateral or consideration not contemplated in the appraisal 
an appraisal over one year old in most cases will be considered stale dated and an updated or new appraisal will be required 
any adjustments from appraised value to net realizable value are detailed and justified in the impairment analysis  which is reviewed and approved by senior credit quality officers and the company s allowance for loan and lease losses alll committee 
although an external appraisal is the primary source to value collateral dependent loans  we may also utilize values obtained through purchase and sale agreements  negotiated short sales  broker price opinions  or the sales price of the note 
these alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution 
impairment analyses are updated  reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis at or near the end of each reporting period 
based on these processes  we do not believe there are significant time lapses for the recognition of additional loan loss provisions or charge offs from the date they become known 
loans are classified as non accrual when collection of principal or interest is doubtful generally if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by days or more unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
additionally  all loans that are impaired are considered for non accrual status 
loans placed on non accrual will typically remain on non accrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain 
upon acquisition of real estate collateral  typically through the foreclosure process  we promptly begin to market the property for sale 
if we do not begin to receive offers or indications of interest we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether a lower price reflects the market value of the property and would enable us to sell the property 
in addition  we update appraisals on other real estate owned property six to nine months after the most recent appraisal 
increases in valuation adjustments recorded in a period are primarily based on a updated appraisals received during the period  or b management s authorization to reduce the selling price of the property during the period 
unless a current appraisal is available  an appraisal will be ordered prior to a loan moving to other real estate owned 
foreclosed properties held as other real estate owned are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or market value of the property less expected selling costs 
other real estate owned at december  totaled million and consisted of properties 
at december   one property with a carrying value of million is subject to a sales contract  but is accounted for under the deposit method and continues to be reported as other real estate owned 
loans are reported as restructured when the bank grants a concession s to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties that it would not otherwise consider 
examples of such concessions include a reduction in the loan rate  forgiveness of principal or accrued interest  extending the maturity date s or providing a lower interest rate than would be normally available for a transaction of similar risk 
as a result of these concessions  restructured loans are impaired as the bank will not collect all amounts due  both principal and interest  in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
impairment reserves on non collateral dependent restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows on the 
table of contents restructured loans discounted at the interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loan s carrying value 
these impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the company has written down impaired  non accrual loans as of december  to their estimated net realizable value  based on disposition value  and expects resolution with no additional material loss  absent further decline in market prices

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation affected by the housing market downturn or the real estate bubble  or indirectly impacted from the contraction of real estate dependent businesses 
the remaining non performing loans in these segments primarily reflect the impact of the us recession on certain businesses 
the company is continually performing extensive reviews of our permanent commercial real estate portfolio  including stress testing 
these reviews are being performed on both our non owner and owner occupied credits 
these reviews are being completed to verify leasing status  to ensure the accuracy of risk ratings  and to develop proactive action plans with borrowers on projects 
the stress testing has been performed to determine the effect of rising cap rates  interest rates and vacancy rates  on this portfolio 
based on our analysis  the company believes our lending teams are effectively managing the risks in this portfolio 
there can be no assurance that any further declines in economic conditions  such as potential increases in retail or office vacancy rates  will exceed the projected assumptions utilized in the stress testing and may result in additional non performing loans in the future 
at december  and december   impaired loans of million and million were classified as performing restructured loans  respectively 
the restructurings were granted in response to borrower financial difficulty  and generally provide for a temporary modification of loan repayment terms 
the performing restructured loans on accrual status represent the only impaired loans accruing interest at each respective date 
in order for a restructured loan to be considered performing and on accrual status  the loan s collateral coverage generally will be greater than or equal to of the loan balance  the loan is current on payments  and the borrower must either prefund an interest reserve or demonstrate the ability to make payments from a verified source of cash flow

allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for loan and lease losses alll totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses as of december  as compared to prior year is principally attributable to an increase in provision for loan and lease losses in excess of charge offs 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses allowance for loan and lease losses composition as of december  in thousands real estate commercial loans to individuals and overdrafts unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses the unallocated portion of alll provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk rating based component  or in the specific impairment reserve component of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models 
as of december   the unallocated allowance amount represented of the allowance for loan and lease losses  consistent with the level at december  the level in unallocated alll in the current year reflects management s evaluation of the existing general business and economic conditions  and declining credit quality and collateral values of real estate in our markets 
the alll composition should not be interpreted as an indication of specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs may occur

the us recession  the housing market downturn  and declining real estate values in our markets have negatively impacted aspects of our residential development  commercial real estate  commercial construction and commercial loan portfolios  resulting in downgrades within the portfolio  an increase in non performing loans  and an increase in loans charged off during the year 
downgrades within the portfolio have increased our classified credit balances resulting in a higher risk rating based component of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
all impaired loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
if the measurement of each impaired loans value is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we recognize this impairment and adjust the carrying value of the loan to fair value through the allowance for loan and lease losses 
this can be accomplished by charging off the impaired portion of the loan or establishing a specific component within the allowance for loan and lease losses 
if in management s assessment the sources of repayment will not result in a reasonable probability that the carrying value of a loan can be recovered  the amount of a loan s specific impairment is charged off against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
prior to the second quarter of  the company established specific reserves within the allowance for loan and leases losses for loan impairments and recognized the charge off of the impairment reserve when the loan was resolved  sold  or foreclosed and transferred to other real estate owned 
due to declining real estate values in our markets and the deterioration of the us economy in general  it is increasingly likely that impairment reserves on collateral dependent loans  particularly those relating to real estate  will not be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss 
as a result  beginning in the second quarter of  the company began recognizing the charge off of impairment reserves on impaired loans in the period they arise for collateral dependent loans 
this process has effectively accelerated the recognition of charge offs recognized since the second quarter of the change in our 
table of contents assessment of the possible recoverability of our collateral dependent impaired loans carrying values has ultimately had no impact on our impairment valuation procedures or the amount of provision for loan and leases losses included within the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment reserves on non collateral dependent restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows on the restructured loans discounted at the interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loan s carrying value 
these impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
at december   the recorded investment in loans classified as impaired totaled million  with a corresponding valuation allowance included in the allowance for loan and lease losses of million 
the valuation allowance on impaired loans represents the impairment reserves on performing restructured loans 
at december   the total recorded investment in impaired loans was million  with no corresponding valuation allowance 
the majority of loan charge offs in the current year relate to real estate related credits 
in the current year we experienced increased charge offs related to our residential development  commercial real estate  commercial construction and commercial portfolios 
these charge offs were largely driven by the deteriorating economic conditions coupled with falling real estate values in our markets 
the majority of all charge offs taken in the current year relate to borrowers that were directly affected by the housing market downturn or indirectly impacted from the contraction of real estate dependent businesses the following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc summary of reserve for unfunded commitments activity years ended december  in thousands balance  beginning of year acquisition net decrease credited to other expenses balance  end of year we believe that the alll and ruc at december  are sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit commitments outstanding as of that date  respectively  based on the best information available 
this assessment  based in part on historical levels of net charge offs  loan growth  and a detailed review of the quality of the loan portfolio  involves uncertainty and judgment 
therefore  the adequacy of the alll and ruc cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation mortgage servicing rights the following table presents the key elements of our mortgage servicing rights asset as of december   and summary of mortgage servicing rights years ended december  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year additions for new mortgage servicing rights capitalized changes in fair value due to changes in model inputs or assumptions other balance  end of year balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions  which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates 
represents changes due to collection realization of expected cash flows over time 
mortgage servicing rights are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in mortgage banking revenue 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is impacted by market rates for mortgage loans 
historically low market rates can cause prepayments to increase as a result of refinancing activity 
to the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded  it is possible that certain mortgage servicing rights assets may decrease in value 
generally  the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began using derivative instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of msr due to changes in interest rates 
starting in late february and continuing into march  the bond markets experienced extraordinary volatility 
this volatility resulted in widening spreads and price declines on the derivative instruments that were not offset by corresponding gains in the msr asset 
as a result  a million charge was recognized within mortgage banking revenue in the first quarter of in march  the company suspended the msr hedge  given the continued volatility 
additional information about the company s mortgage servicing rights is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had recognized goodwill of million  as compared to million at december  the goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management evaluates intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of december additionally  we perform impairment evaluations on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others  a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  and unanticipated competition 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit eg retail brokerage and community banking to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  the company would be required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step the company calculates the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the estimated fair value of the company is allocated to all of the company s assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  as if the company had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is the price paid to acquire it 
the allocation process is performed only for purposes of determining the amount of goodwill impairment 
no assets or liabilities are written up or down  nor are any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets recorded as a part of this process 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings in an amount equal to that excess 
substantially all of the company s goodwill is associated with our community banking operations 
due to a further decline in the company s market capitalization below book value of equity and continued weakness in the banking industry  the company performed a goodwill impairment evaluation of the community banking operating segment as of june  the company engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist us in determining whether and to what extent our goodwill asset was impaired 
we utilized a variety of valuation techniques to analyze and measure the estimated fair value of reporting units under both the income and market valuation approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by projecting future earnings for five years  utilizing a terminal value based on expected future growth rates  and applying a discount rate reflective of current market conditions 
the estimation of forecasted earnings uses management s best estimate of economic and market conditions over the projected periods and considers estimated growth rates in loans and deposits and future expected changes in net interest margins 
various market based valuation approaches are utilized and include applying market price to earnings  core deposit premium  and tangible book value multiples as observed from relevant  comparable peer companies of the reporting unit 
we also valued the reporting unit by applying an estimated control premium to the market capitalization 
weightings are assigned to each of the aforementioned model results  judgmentally allocated based on the observability and reliability of the inputs  to arrive at a final fair value estimate of the reporting unit 
the results of the company s and valuation specialist s step one impairment test indicated that the reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying value 
as a result  the company performed a step two analysis 
the external valuation specialist assisted management s analysis under step two of the goodwill impairment test 
under this approach  we calculated the fair value for the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  as well as its unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  such as the core deposit intangible and trade name 
fair value adjustments to items on the balance sheet primarily related to investment securities held to maturity  loans  other real estate owned  visa class b common stock  deferred taxes  deposits  term debt  and junior subordinated debentures carried at amortized cost 
the external valuation specialist assisted management to estimate the fair value of our unrecognized identifiable assets  such as the core deposit intangible and trade name 
the most significant fair value adjustment made in this analysis was to adjust the carrying value of the company s loans receivable portfolio to fair value 
the fair value of the company s loan receivable portfolio at june  was estimated in a manner similar to methodology utilized as part of the december  goodwill impairment evaluation 
as part of the december  loan valuation  the loan portfolio was stratified into sixty eight loan pools that shared common characteristics  namely loan type  payment terms  and whether the loans were performing or non performing 
each loan pool was discounted at a rate that considers current market interest rates  credit risk  and assumed liquidity premiums required based upon the nature of the underlying pool 
due to the disruption in the financial markets experienced during and continuing through  the liquidity premium reflects the reduction in demand in the secondary markets for all grades of non conforming credit  including those that are performing 
liquidity premiums for individual loan categories generally ranged from for performing loans to for construction and non performing loans 
at december   the fair value of the overall loan portfolio was calculated to be at a discount relative to its book value 
the composition of the loan portfolio at june   including loan type and performance indicators  was substantially similar to the loan portfolio at december  at june   the fair value of the loan portfolio was estimated to be at a discount relative to its carrying value 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation the additional discount is primarily attributed to the additional liquidity premium required as of the measurement date associated with the company s concentration of commercial real estate loans 
other significant fair value adjustments utilized in this goodwill impairment analysis included the value of the core deposit intangible asset which was calculated as of core deposits  and includes all deposits except certificates of deposit 
the carrying value of other real estate owned was discounted by  representing a liquidity adjustment given the current market conditions 
the fair value of our trade name  which represents the competitive advantage associated with our brand recognition and ability to attract and retain relationships  was estimated to be million 
the fair value of our junior subordinated debentures carried at amortized cost was determined in a manner and utilized inputs  primarily the credit risk adjusted spread  consistent with our methodology for determining the fair value of junior subordinated debentures recorded at fair value 
information relating to our methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial instruments that were adjusted to fair value as part of this analysis  including the visa class b common stock  deposits  term debt  and junior subordinated debentures  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on the results of the step two analysis  the company determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than its carrying amount on the company s balance sheet  and as a result  we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million in the second quarter of this write down of goodwill is a non cash charge that does not affect the company s or the bank s liquidity or operations 
in addition  because goodwill is excluded in the calculation of regulatory capital  the company s well capitalized regulatory capital ratios are not affected by this charge 
the company also conducted its annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment as of december  in the first step of the goodwill impairment test the company determined that the fair value of the community banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
this determination is consistent with the events occurring after the company recognized the million impairment of goodwill second quarter of first  the market capitalization and estimated fair value of the company increased significantly subsequent to the recognition of the impairment charge as the fair value of the company s stock increased from june  to december  secondly  the company s successful public common stock offering in the third quarter of diluted the carrying value of the reporting book equity on a per share basis  against which the fair value of the reporting unit is measured 
the significant assumptions and methodology utilized to test for goodwill impairment as of december  were consistent with the impairment evaluations performed throughout the year 
if the company s common stock price declines further or continues to trade below book value per common share  or should general economic conditions deteriorate further or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time  particularly in the financial industry  the company may be required to recognize additional impairment of all  or some portion of  its goodwill 
it is possible that changes in circumstances  existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future  or changes in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments  assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill  such as valuation multiples  discount rates  or projected earnings  could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
additional impairment charges  if any  may be material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
however  any potential future impairment charge will have no effect on the company s or the bank s cash balances  liquidity  or regulatory capital ratios 
the inputs management utilizes to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit in step one of the goodwill impairment test  and estimating the fair values of the underlying assets and liabilities of a reporting unit in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  require management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates where observable market may not readily exist 
such inputs include  but are not limited to  trading multiples from comparable transactions  control premiums  the value that may arise from synergies and other benefits that would accrue from control over an entity  and the appropriate rates to discount projected cash flows 
additionally  there may be limited current market inputs to value certain assets or liabilities  particularly loans and junior subordinated debentures 
these valuation inputs are considered to be level inputs 
management will continue to monitor the relationship of the company s market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value  which management attributes to both financial services industry wide and company specific factors  and to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents as a result of the december  goodwill impairment evaluation related to the retail brokerage reporting segment  management determined that there was a million impairment following the departure of certain umpqua investments financial advisors 
the valuation of the impairment at the retail brokerage operating segment was determined using an income approach by discounting cash flows of forecasted earnings 
the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit include earnings forecasts for five years  a terminal value based on expected future growth rates  and a discount rate reflective of current market conditions 
the company evaluated the retail brokerage reporting segment s goodwill for impairment as of december  the first step of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value 
as of december   the ending carrying value of the retail brokerage segment s goodwill was million 
at december   we had other intangible assets of million  as compared to million at december  as part of a business acquisition  a portion of the purchase price is allocated to the other value of intangible assets such as the merchant servicing portfolio or core deposits  which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit 
the value of these other intangible assets were determined by a third party based on the net present value of future cash flows for the merchant servicing portfolio and an analysis of the cost differential between the core deposits and alternative funding sources for the core deposit intangible 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives  and are also reviewed for impairment 
we amortize other intangible assets on an accelerated or straight line basis over an estimated ten to fifteen year life 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an  impairment related to the merchant servicing portfolio obtained through the north bay acquisition 
the remaining decrease in other intangible assets resulted from scheduled amortization 
no other impairment losses were recognized in connection with other intangible assets since their initial recognition

cdars deposits can be reciprocal or one way 
all of the bank s cdars deposits are reciprocal 
at december  and december   the company s cdars balances totaled million and million  respectively

at december   the bank had outstanding term debt of million primarily with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
term debt outstanding as of december  decreased million since december  primarily as a result of the repayment of fhlb borrowings 
the overall decrease in borrowings is largely attributable to the enhanced liquidity and growth in deposits in the current year 
advances from the fhlb amounted to million of the total term debt and are secured by investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
of the million  million of the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had a fixed interest rate of  and the remaining balances had fixed interest rates ranging from to 
of the total term debt outstanding  million  or  mature prior to december   and the remaining mature after december  management expects continued use of fhlb advances as a source of short and long term funding

junior subordinated debentures we had junior subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million  respectively  at december  and at december   approximately million  or of the total issued amount  had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over three month libor 
interest expense for junior subordinated debentures 
table of contents decreased in as compared to and in as compared to  primarily resulting from decreases in short term market interest rates and libor 
although increases in short term market interest rates will increase the interest expense for junior subordinated debentures  we believe that other attributes of our balance sheet will serve to mitigate the impact to net interest income on a consolidated basis 
on january   the company elected the fair value measurement option for certain pre existing junior subordinated debentures of million the umpqua statutory trusts 
the remaining junior subordinated debentures as of the adoption date were acquired through business combinations and were measured at fair value at the time of acquisition 
in  the company issued two series of trust preferred securities and elected to measure each instrument at fair value 
accounting for junior subordinated debentures originally issued by the company at fair value enables us to more closely align our financial performance with the economic value of those liabilities 
additionally  we believe it improves our ability to manage the market and interest rate risks associated with the junior subordinated debentures 
the junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value and amortized cost have been presented as separate line items on the balance sheet 
the ending carrying fair value of the junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value represents the estimated amount that would be paid to transfer these liabilities in an orderly transaction amongst market participants under current market conditions as of the measurement date 
prior to the second quarter of  we estimated the fair value of junior subordinated debentures using an internal discounted cash flow model 
the future cash flows of these instruments were extended to the next available redemption date or maturity date as appropriate based upon the spreads of recent issuances or quotes from brokers for comparable bank holding companies  as available  compared to the contractual spread of each junior subordinated debenture measured at fair value 
the significant inputs utilized in the estimation of fair value of these instruments is the credit risk adjusted spread and three month libor 
the credit risk adjusted spread represents the nonperformance risk of the liability  contemplating both the inherent risk of the obligation and the company s entity specific credit risk 
generally  an increase in the credit risk adjusted spread and or a decrease in the three month libor will result in positive fair value adjustments 
conversely  a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and or an increase in the three month libor will result in negative fair value adjustments 
for additional assurance  we obtained valuations from a third party pricing service to validate the results of our model 
prior to the third quarter of  we utilized a credit risk adjusted spread that was based upon recent issuances or quotes from brokers for comparable bank holding companies as of the date of valuation  and we considered this to be a level input 
due to the increasing credit concerns in the capital markets and inactivity in the trust preferred markets that have limited the observability of credit risk adjusted market spreads  we classified this as a level fair value measure in the third quarter of in the second quarter of  due to continued inactivity in the junior subordinated debenture and related markets  and clarified guidance relating to the determination of fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased or where transactions are not orderly  management utilized a third party pricing service to estimate the fair value of these liabilities 
the pricing service utilizes an income approach valuation technique  specifically an option adjusted spread oas valuation model 
this oas model values the cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios and discounts these cash flows using a credit risk adjustment spread over the three month libor swap curve 
the oas model currently being utilized is more sophisticated and computationally intensive than the model previously used  however  the models react similarly to changes in the underlying inputs and the results are considered comparable 
with the assistance of a third party pricing service  we determined that a credit risk adjusted spread of basis points is representative of the nonperformance risk premium a market participant would require under current market conditions as of december  generally  an increase in the credit risk adjusted spread and or a decrease in the swap curve will result in positive fair value adjustments 
conversely  a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and or an increase in the swap curve will result in negative fair value adjustments 
we recorded gains of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting from the change in fair value of the junior subordinated debentures recorded at fair value 
the change in fair value of the junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value during these periods primarily result from the widening of the credit risk adjusted spread 
management believes that the credit risk adjusted spread being utilized is indicative of the 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation nonperformance risk premium a willing market participant would require under current market conditions  that is  the inactive market 
future contractions in the credit risk adjusted spread relative to the spread currently utilized to measure the company s junior subordinated debentures at fair value as of december   or the passage of time  will result in negative fair value adjustments 
generally  an increase in the credit risk adjusted spread and or a decrease in the three month libor swap curve will result in positive fair value adjustments 
conversely  a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and or an increase in the three month libor swap curve will result in negative fair value adjustments 
in management s estimation  the change in fair value of the junior subordinated debentures during the periods represent changes in the market s nonperformance risk expectations and pricing of this type of debt  and not as a result of changes to our entity specific credit risk 
additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
all of the debentures issued to the trusts  less the common stock of the trusts  qualified as tier capital as of december   under guidance issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system

liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the bank s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs 
we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
one source of funds includes public deposits 
individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits  typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance 
the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state  depending on the individual state s risk assessment of depository institutions 
changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits  drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement  or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank 
in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities  the bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit  sell securities under agreements to repurchase  borrow on a secured basis from the fhlb or issue brokered certificates of deposit 
the bank had available lines of credit with the fhlb totaling billion at december  subject to certain collateral requirements  namely the amount of pledged loans and investment securities 
the bank had uncommitted federal funds line of credit agreements with additional financial institutions totaling million at december  availability of the lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility 
these lines are intended to support short term liquidity needs  and the agreements may restrict the consecutive day usage 
the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of the company s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
in  the bank paid the company million in dividends to fund regular operations 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to fund its quarterly cash dividend distributions to shareholders  when approved  and meet its ongoing cash obligations  which consist principally of debt service on the million issued amount of outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowing arrangements of its own 
additional discussion related to liquidity related risks given the current economic climate is provided in item a risk factors above 
as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this report  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the difference between cash provided by operating activities and net loss largely consisted of

the million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million increase in net deposits and in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  partially offset by million repayment of term debt  million of dividends paid on common stock and million of dividends paid on preferred stock 
although we expect the bank s and the company s liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during  there is significant competition for bank deposits 
it is possible that our deposit growth for may not be maintained at previous levels due to increased pricing pressure or  in order to generate deposit growth  our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits

the federal reserve board has in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank financial holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
our consolidated tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill  other intangible assets  disallowed servicing assets and disallowed deferred tax assets  totaled billion at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of  the allowance for loan and lease losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits 
the total of tier i capital plus tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was billion at december  the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  the tier and total risk based capital ratios at december  were and  respectively 
a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as period end shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated financial holding companies that are not undertaking significant expansion programs  the federal reserve board may require a financial holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and financial holding companies 
our consolidated leverage ratios at december  and were  and  respectively 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the bank s regulatory capital category 
during the year ended december   the company contributed million to the bank to strengthen its capital position 
at december   all three of the capital ratios of the bank exceeded the minimum ratios required by federal regulation 
management monitors these ratios on a regular basis to ensure that the bank remains within regulatory guidelines

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
net interest income and the fair value of financial instruments are greatly influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
we manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies that are established by the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the board of directors loan and investment committee provides oversight of the asset liability management process  reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the alco and approves the asset liability policy on an annual basis 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the table below sets forth interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  
table of contents interest sensitivity gap dollars in thousands by repricing interval non rate sensitive total months months years over years assets interest bearing deposits temporary investments trading account assets securities available for sale securities held to maturity loans and loans held for sale non interest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase term debt junior subordinated debentures non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a of earning assets changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and generally relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of short term assets tied to the prime rate are different from those of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these prepayments may have a significant impact on our net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of december  is indicated in the table below 
for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
for example  the up basis points scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of basis points per month for twelve months applied to the balance sheet of december for each respective year 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation interest rate simulation impact on net interest income as of december  dollars in thousands increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points at december   we believe our balance sheet was in a liability sensitive position  as the repricing characteristics were such that an increase in market interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income and a decrease in market interest rates would have positive effect on net interest income 
as of december   we were liability sensitive in three of four scenarios 
in an increased market interest rate scenario  our liability sensitivity need increased from at december   we were liability sensitive in an increased market interest rate scenario  and asset sensitive in a decreased interest rate scenario 
some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which we could undertake to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected  in the actual level of market interest rates or competitive influences on our deposit base 
a second interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
this approach provides a longer term view of interest rate risk  capturing all future expected cash flows 
assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques 
the table below illustrates the effects of various market interest rate changes on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities excluding mortgage servicing rights as compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values interest rate simulation impact on fair value of financial assets and liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands increase decrease in estimated fair value of equity percentage change increase decrease in estimated fair value of equity percentage change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points consistent with the results in the interest rate simulation impact on net interest income  our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes as of december  has decreased compared to december  
table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
we believe that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on management s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
we have an asset liability management program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
our financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions
