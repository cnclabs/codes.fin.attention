customers we supply our products primarily to manufacturers in the medical device market 
our customers include large orthopedic device manufacturers  including biomet inc  depuy orthopaedics  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  depuy  medtronic inc  smith nephew plc  stryker corp 
and zimmer holdings  inc zimmer 
we also have established relationships  primarily through our case product offerings  with leading medical device manufacturers and distributors in numerous other medical device market segments  including cardinal health  inc  karl storz  edward lifesciences and st 
jude medical inc 
with the addition of ssi in august  we serve over  additional customers  some of which own multiple hospitals 
we sold to approximately  customers in fiscal sales to our ten largest customers represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
our largest customer accounted for of our revenue in fiscal and our two largest customers accounted for and of our revenue in fiscal our largest customer in fiscal was depuy 
our largest customers in were depuy and zimmer 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenue in fiscal or fiscal we typically serve several product teams and facilities within each of our largest customers  which mitigate our reliance on any particular customer 
over the past four years  we have reduced our concentration in the orthopedic industry with the acquisitions of riley medical  tnco and ssi  which are primarily in non orthopedic medical markets  and clamonta ltd  which serves the aerospace industry 
we may experience a seasonal impact of the orthopedic industry on revenue in the third quarter because many of our products are used in elective procedures that tend to decline to some degree during the summer months 
we sell our products to customers domestically and in a number of regions outside the united states 
in addition  our customers often distribute globally products purchased from us in the united states 
set forth below is a summary of percent of revenue by selected geographic locations in our last three fiscal years  based on the location to which we shipped our products

table of contents sales and marketing our sales and marketing efforts emphasize our design and engineering expertise  internally developed symmetry products  manufacturing capabilities  international distribution network and our ability to provide customers with a comprehensive product offering 
we are increasingly presenting our products to customers in a total solutions concept which offers the customer a collaborator for developing complete implant  instrument and case solutions 
we have over sales and marketing personnel worldwide serving our original equipment manufacturer oem customers and more than direct sales personnel selling directly to hospitals 
in addition to our internal sales efforts  we also sell standard cases through distributors 
our sales personnel are trained in all of our products in order to cross sell and identify opportunities outside their immediate area of focus 
we typically serve several product teams and facilities within each oem customer which diminishes our reliance on any one purchasing decision 
our customer base for cases extends into nearly every segment of the medical device market 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage our existing relationships among this customer base to achieve greater penetration of our customized instrument and implant products 
we intend to increase our marketing of implants  instruments and our total solutions concept to these customers 
our sales personnel are technically trained and are based in close proximity to or located at our largest customers sites 
this physical proximity allows sales personnel to engage quickly with the marketing  design  engineering and purchasing staffs of these orthopedic device manufacturers 
our sales people are empowered to bring in design and engineering product development teams to facilitate a customer s efforts 
our goal is to collaborate with customers early in the development cycle and to continue through production  packaging  delivery and logistics 
manufacturing and materials we have manufacturing facilities in the united states  united kingdom  france  ireland and malaysia 
we have made investments in recent years to modernize our production facilities  improve our production processes and develop superior technical skills that complement our manufacturing capabilities 
these investments have allowed us to continue to improve the quality of our products  increase our manufacturing capacity and improve our efficiency 
our manufacturing processes include forging 
our forging process uses presses to force heated metal between two dies called tooling that contain a precut profile of the desired implant 
the forging process enhances the strength of an implant  which is important for hip stems and other implants that must withstand significant stress 
many customers prefer forging because it provides greater mechanical properties 
we forge gross shaped  near net shaped and net shaped implants 
our know how enables us to produce precision net shaped forgings in large volumes 
casting 
in the casting process  metal is heated until it is liquid and then poured into an implant mold 
casting can be used to produce implants with intricate shapes 
we have developed a technologically advanced  highly automated  casting facility in sheffield  united kingdom 
plastic and metal forming 
our know how and technology facilitates our extensive plastic and metal forming capabilities 
we use thermoform processes to draw uniform plastic cases and specialized equipment to form metal 
our laser controlled metal working machines allow us to punch and shape metal in intricate and complex detail 
machining finishing 
machining is used extensively to enhance our forged  cast and formed products 
we use computer numerically controlled  multi axis and wire electric discharge equipment to cut  bend  punch  polish and otherwise shape or detail metal or plastic 
our finishing processes include polishing  laser etch marking  graphics and other customer specific processes 
during and  we developed machining capabilities to better serve the spine implant market 

table of contents the majority of products that we produce are customized to the unique specifications of our customers 
our ability to maintain flexible operations is an important factor in maintaining high levels of productivity 
we endeavor to use just in time manufacturing and flexible manufacturing cells in our production processes 
just in time manufacturing is a production technique that minimizes work in process inventory and manufacturing cycles 
manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations grouped in a circular configuration  with the operators placed centrally within the configuration 
cell manufacturing provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs  which enhances our ability to maintain product volumes that are consistent with our customers requirements and reduce our level of inventory 
we use raw materials  including titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other components in the manufacture of our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources  from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we obtain patented radel r plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  from a single supplier for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases 
quality assurance we maintain a comprehensive quality assurance and quality control program  which includes the control and documentation of all material specifications  operating procedures  equipment maintenance and quality control methods 
our quality systems are based upon fda requirements and the iso standards for medical device manufacturers 
we believe that all of our facilities are currently in substantial compliance with regulations applicable to them 
for example  in the united states and united kingdom these regulations include the current good manufacturing practice regulations and other quality system regulations imposed by the fda 
specific united states based facilities are registered with and audited by the fda 
our line of polyvac standard cases received fda k clearance  which can reduce our customers burden in obtaining fda approval 
the european  malaysia and specific united states based facilities are iso registered and audited annually 
our facilities have obtained numerous industry specific quality and regulatory assurance certifications 
competition our oem customers  to varying degrees  are capable of internally developing and producing most of the products we provide 
while we believe that our comprehensive offerings and core production competencies allow medical device companies to reduce costs and shorten time to market  one or more of our customers may seek to expand their development and manufacturing operations which may reduce their reliance on independent suppliers such as us 
we compete on the basis of development capability  breadth of product offering  manufacturing quality  cost and on time delivery 
we also compete with independent suppliers of implants  instruments and cases to medical device companies 
a majority of these suppliers are privately owned and produce some  but not all  of the products required in orthopedic implant systems 
we compete with other independent suppliers primarily on the basis of development capability  breadth of product offering  manufacturing quality  cost and on time delivery 
we believe that we are the largest independent supplier of implants  instruments and cases to orthopedic device manufacturers 
however  other independent suppliers may consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing capabilities and brand recognition that are greater than ours 
intellectual property we believe our patents are valuable  however  our knowledge  experience  proprietary and trade secret information  manufacturing processes  product design and development staff and sales staff have been equally or more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we seek to protect our non patented know how  trade secrets  processes and other proprietary confidential information principally through confidentiality  non compete and invention assignment agreements 

table of contents we currently own total issued patents and patents pending related to our cases and instruments 
these patents expire at various times beginning in and ending in we also have issued trademarks and pending trademarks 
our policy is to protect technology  inventions and improvements that we consider important through the use of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets in the united states and significant foreign markets 
if our products were found to infringe any proprietary right of a third party  we could be required to pay significant damages or license fees to the third party or cease production  marketing and distribution of those products 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information we own and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
we cannot provide complete assurance that our existing or future patents  if any  will afford adequate protection  that any existing patent applications will result in issued patents  that our patents will not be circumvented  invalidated  or held unenforceable  that our proprietary information will not become known to  or be independently developed by  our competitors  or that the validity or enforceability of any patents or other intellectual property owned by or licensed to us will be upheld if challenged by others in litigation 
due to these and other risks  we do not rely solely on our patents and other intellectual property to maintain our competitive position 
although intellectual property is important to our business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset  we do not believe that any single patent  trade secret  trademark or copyright  or group of patents  trade secrets  trademarks or copyrights is critical to the success of our business 
employees as of february  we had  employees 
our employees are not represented by any unions 
from time to time in the past  however  some of our employees have attempted to unionize at two of our facilities 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees 
government regulation our business is subject to governmental regulation 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the emission  discharge  use  storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of these materials at our facilities and at off site disposal locations 
we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws currently applicable to our business and we are not subject to any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any company facility or any off site location 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such environmental liabilities in the future as a result of historic or current operations 
as a component manufacturer  our medical products are subject to regulation by the fda 
the fda and related state and foreign governmental agencies regulate many of our customers products as medical devices 
in many cases  the fda must approve those products prior to commercialization 
we believe that our existing medical manufacturing plants comply with current good manufacturing practices as applicable 
we have master files on record with the fda 
master files may be used to provide confidential detailed information about facilities  processes or articles used in the manufacturing  processing  packaging and storing of one or more medical device components 
these submissions may be used by device manufacturers to support the premarket notification process required by section k of the federal food drug cosmetic act 
this notification process is necessary to obtain clearance from the fda to market a device for human use in the united states 
we are also subject to various other environmental  transportation and labor laws as well as various other directives and regulations both in the us and abroad 
we believe that compliance with these laws will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
given the scope and nature of these laws  however  there can be no assurance that they will not have a material impact on our results of operations

risk factors our profitability is subject to risks described under this section on risk factors described below 
although the following are not necessarily the only ones facing our company  our business  financial condition or results of operations they could be materially adversely affected by many of the following risks 
risks related to our business we depend heavily on sales to our significant customers  and our business could be adversely affected if any of them reduced or terminated purchases from us 
a limited number of large orthopedic device manufacturers  all of whom are our customers  control the predominant share of the orthopedic device market 
we depend heavily on revenue from these large companies 
revenue from our ten largest customers represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year and of our revenue in fiscal year our largest customer accounted for approximately of our revenue in the fiscal year and our two largest customers accounted for and of our revenue in fiscal we expect that we will continue to depend on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
our sales may be impacted by significant changes in our customers market share  cyclicality  unpredictability of their new product launch activity and possible changes in their supply chain management 
many healthcare companies are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power 
as the healthcare industry continues to consolidate  our customers may delay demand as they integrate operations and products 
a consolidation of our customers may also impact demand for our products as the consolidated company implements their supply chain management philosophy 
consolidation of our competitors may also increase pressure as they combine product and services offerings 
consolidation of our customers or competitors may increase pricing pressure or reduce our revenue  either of which would impact our operating results 
if we are unable to continue to improve our current products and develop new products  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products or our products could become obsolete  and our business would be adversely affected 
we sell our products to customers in markets that are characterized by technological change  product innovation and evolving industry standards 
we are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs  both in collaboration with our customers and independently 
our customers may engage in additional in house development and manufacturing  and we may be unable to compete effectively with our independent competitors  unless we can continue to develop and assist our customers in developing innovative products 
our competitors product development capabilities could become more effective than ours  and their new products may get to market before our products  may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
if one or more of these events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
we face competition from our customers in house capabilities  established independent suppliers and potential new market entrants  and if we lose customers it could have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
our customers have varying degrees of development and manufacturing capabilities  and one or more of them may seek to expand their in house capabilities in the future  including adding capacity in existing sites or expanding into low labor cost areas such as asia 
many of our customers are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and can commit significant resources to product development and manufacturing 
many of our independent competitors are smaller companies  many of which have close customer relationships and either a low cost structure or highly specialized design or production capabilities 
our independent competitors may continue to consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing and manufacturing capabilities or brand recognition that are greater than ours 
in addition  the innovative nature of our markets may attract new entrants to the field 
our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies  which could result in the loss of customers and  as a result  decreased revenue and operating results 
if product liability lawsuits are brought against us or our customers our business may be harmed 
the manufacture and sale of our healthcare and other products  including our aerospace products  expose us to potential product liability claims and product recalls  including those which may arise from misuse 
table of contents or malfunction of  or design or manufacturing flaws in  our products  or use of our products with components or systems not manufactured by us 
product liability claims or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or otherwise require us to pay significant damages  which could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
we carry product liability insurance but it is limited in scope and amount and may not be adequate to protect us against product liability claims 
we may be unable to maintain this insurance at reasonable costs and on reasonable terms  if at all 
our operating results are subject to significant potential fluctuation and historical results should not be relied on as an indication of our future results 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year in the future due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the timing of significant orders and shipments  including the effects of changes in inventory management practices by our customers  the number  timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us  our customers and our competitors  changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors  changes in medical treatment or regulatory practices  restrictions and delays caused by regulatory review of our customers products  recalls of our customers products  availability and cost of raw materials  and general economic factors 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
if we do not retain key individuals and retain and attract skilled manufacturing workers  we may not be able to operate successfully  and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives 
our success depends in part upon the retention of key managerial  sales and technical personnel  particularly skilled manufacturing workers 
we compete for such personnel with other companies and other organizations  many of which are larger and have greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully 
we compete with numerous precision manufacturing companies to attract and retain qualified and highly skilled manufacturing employees 
our warsaw  indiana facilities  in particular  face significant competition  including from certain of our customers and other companies located in or near warsaw that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do  for skilled production employees 
if we are not able to retain and attract skilled manufacturing employees  we may be unable to support our anticipated growth  which could adversely affect our profitability 
a significant shift in technologies or methods used in the treatment of damaged or diseased bone and tissue could make our products obsolete or less attractive 
the development of new technologies could reduce demand for our products 
for example  pharmaceutical advances could result in non surgical treatments gaining more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopedic implants 
the emergence of successful new biological tissue based or synthetic materials to regenerate damaged or 
table of contents diseased bone and to repair damaged tissue could increasingly minimize or delay the need for implant surgery and provide other biological alternatives to orthopedic implants 
new surgical procedures could diminish demand for our instruments 
a significant shift in technologies or methods used in the treatment of damaged or diseased bone and tissue could adversely affect demand for our products 
we depend on third party suppliers  and in some cases a single third party supplier  for key components and raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and the loss of these sources could harm our business 
we use plastic  titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other raw materials in our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources  from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we obtain patented radel r plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases from a single supplier 
any supply interruption in a limited or sole sourced component or raw material could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply  if any  could be found 
we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
this could interrupt our business or reduce the quality of our products 
our current or future levels of indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business  finance acquisitions and pursue new business strategies 
as of january   our total indebtedness  including short term debt  long term debt and capital lease obligations was million 
presently  we have the full amount available under our million revolving credit facility and million of term loans 
although our senior credit facility  maturing june  contains covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  in the future we may incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  business opportunities  capital expenditures or other capital requirements 
our indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions  make it more difficult to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  require us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of our cash flow from operations for making payments on our indebtedness  which would prevent us from using it for other purposes  make us susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates that affect the cost of our borrowings to the extent that our variable rate debt is not covered by interest rate derivative agreements  and make it more difficult to pursue strategic acquisitions  alliances and collaborations 
our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
we believe that  based upon current levels of operations  we will be able to meet our debt service obligations when due 
significant assumptions underlie this belief  including  among others  that we will continue to be successful in implementing our business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in our business  liquidity or capital requirements 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations and commitments  we may be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose 
we cannot assure you that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all  or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments 
to the extent we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations in the future  the risks associated with our indebtedness described above  including our possible inability to service our debt  would increase 
our senior credit facility contains restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt  make acquisitions and make other investments 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders or other payments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios 
if we do not satisfy these tests or comply with 
table of contents these ratios  our creditors could declare a default under our debt instruments  and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 
our ability to comply with the provisions of our senior credit facility may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control 
our senior credit facility also contains covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness  invest in our foreign operations  acquire other businesses and make capital expenditures  and impose various other restrictions 
these covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
we may be unable to comply with the foregoing financial ratios or covenants and  if we fail to do so  we may be unable to obtain waivers from our lenders 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenue generated by sales of our products  expenses incurred in manufacturing and selling our products  costs of developing new products or technologies  costs associated with capital expenditures  costs associated with our expansion  costs associated with regulatory compliance  including maintaining compliance with the quality system regulations imposed by the fda  the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions  working capital requirements related to our growing new acquisitions  and expansion of our international facilities 
as a result of these factors  we may need to raise additional funds  and these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
furthermore  if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds  our existing stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  execute our business strategy  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements 
we may not realize all of the sales expected from new product development programs 
we incur substantial expenses in developing and testing new products and related devices 
the realization of additional revenue from new product development efforts is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties  including  directly or indirectly  end user acceptance of the product  reimbursement approval of third party payers such as medicaid  medicare and private insurers and  in some cases  fda or comparable foreign regulatory approval of the product 
in addition  our customers typically have no contractual requirement to purchase from us the products that we develop for their medical devices  and they could seek to have another supplier or in house facility manufacture products that we have developed for their medical devices 
we also incur costs and make capital expenditures for new product development and production based upon certain estimates of production volumes for our existing and anticipated products 
if the actual demand for our products is less than planned  our revenue and net income may decline 
our earnings could decline if we write off goodwill or intangible assets created as a result of our various acquisitions 
as a result of acquisitions we have accumulated a substantial amount of goodwill  amounting to million as of january   or approximately of our total assets as of such date 
goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment by us annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances develop that would 
table of contents likely result in impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal or business climate  an adverse regulatory action  unanticipated competition or financial restatements 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property and property rights  or are subject to intellectual property claims by third parties  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  know how  trademarks  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our technologies and products 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that they will deter infringement  misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expenses and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws  or at all 
we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive advantages 
we seek to protect our trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part  with confidentiality agreements with our employees  independent distributors and customers 
we cannot assure you  however  that these agreements will not be breached  we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors 
we hold licenses with third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we are infringing  misappropriating or violating their intellectual property rights 
we could be found to infringe those intellectual property rights  which could affect our ability to manufacture any affected product 
in addition  any protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could drain our financial resources  divert the time and effort of our management and cause customers to delay or limit their purchases of the affected product until resolution of the litigation 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not successful  could result in substantial costs and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which could adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign or  in the case of trademark claims  rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may not be possible and could be costly and time consuming if it is possible to do so 
significant changes to product or manufacturing process within our industry 
our business may be impacted if there is a significant  game changing  technological manufacturing process or product innovation which is protected by intellectual property and we are not able to react to this change or we are locked out of the new technology by competition owned intellectual property 

table of contents we are subject to risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have significant international operations and we continue to expand and grow these operations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  ireland and malaysia 
certain risks are inherent in international operations  including difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  tax rates in certain foreign countries that may exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country  general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate or where end users of orthopedic devices reside may have an adverse effect on our operations  difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights  and required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business as a whole 
efforts to acquire additional companies or product lines may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations  and if we complete additional acquisitions  we may incur or assume additional liabilities or experience integration problems 
since the beginning of  we have completed six acquisitions 
going forward  we may seek to acquire additional businesses or product lines for various reasons  including providing new product manufacturing capabilities  adding new customers  increasing penetration with existing customers or expanding into new geographic markets 
our ability to successfully grow through additional acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financings 
these additional efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and integration of our recently completed acquisitions 
if we complete additional acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these businesses  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies  or adverse customer reaction to the business combination 
additional acquisitions could also materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt and acquisition expenses or requiring us to amortize acquired assets 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenue and financial results 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars 
currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to  among other things  changes in local  regional or global economic conditions  the imposition of currency 
table of contents exchange restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments 
to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs incurred in the same currency  exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we may be adversely affected as a result of the long lead times required for sales of certain new products 
we often compete for business at the beginning of the development of new medical devices or upon customer redesign of existing medical devices 
our customers generally must obtain clearance or approval from the fda before commercially distributing their products 
unless exempt  a new medical device must be approved for commercial distribution in the united states by the fda through the k pre market notification process or  in some cases  through the more burdensome pre market approval  or pma  process 
it generally takes three to six months from the date of submission to the fda to obtain k clearance and one to three years from the date of submission to the fda to obtain approval through the pma process  but in each case may take significantly longer 
this results in long lead times for some of our customers new products  which may make it difficult in the short term for us to obtain sales of new products to replace any unexpected decline in sales of existing products 
we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages  other labor matters  or new labor laws 
currently  none of our facilities are unionized 
however  from time to time some of our employees have attempted to unionize at two of our facilities 
in addition  some of our orthopedic device customers have unionized work forces 
while we have not experienced any adverse effects from work stoppages or slow downs at our customers facilities  work stoppages or slow downs experienced by us  our suppliers or our customers or their suppliers could result in slow downs or closures of facilities where our products are made or used 
we cannot assure you that we will not encounter strikes  further unionization efforts  new labor laws  or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes one or more of our manufacturing facilities  we may be unable to manufacture certain products for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline 
we have seventeen manufacturing facilities located in the united states  united kingdom  france  ireland and malaysia 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment and personnel know how that we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event that one of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to attempt to shift production to our other manufacturing facilities or rely on third party manufacturers  and our other facilities or a third party manufacturer may not have the capability to effectively supply the affected products 
although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business  this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
the recent financial crisis and current uncertainty in global economic conditions could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the united states and other countries around the world have been experiencing deteriorating economic conditions  including unprecedented financial market disruption 
if this trend in economic conditions continues to deteriorate further  it could lead to delayed or decreased demand for our product 
it may additionally adversely affect our customers access to capital  willingness to spend capital on our products  or ability to pay for products they will order or have already ordered from us 
furthermore  if our suppliers face challenges in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses  they may become unable to continue to offer the key components and raw materials needed in our manufacturing processes 
during these periods of potential economic uncertainty  our ability to accurately forecast the future may be impacted 
we may experience difficulties  delays or unexpected costs from our facility consolidation plan 
we may be required to further consolidate our operations in order to improve our cost structure  achieve increased operating efficiencies  and improve our competitive standing or results of operations and or to address unfavorable economic conditions 
as part of these actions  we may further reduce staff  make changes to certain capital projects  close certain production operations and abandon leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our operations 
in conjunction with any actions  we will continue to 
table of contents make significant investments and build the framework for our future growth 
we may not realize  in full or in part  all of the anticipated benefits and savings from these efforts due to unforeseen difficulties  delays or unexpected costs 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain all of the resulting savings or benefits to our business or other unforeseen events occur  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
as a result of the global economic downturn  we have worked and will continue to work to increase cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures  and in the event of further deterioration of the economy  we may also be required to consider further steps to improve our cost structure 
additionally  the anticipated benefits of our cost reduction initiatives are based on forecasts which could vary substantially from actual results  and we cannot provide assurance that any such cost saving initiatives will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
significant changes to us federal  state and foreign tax laws and regulations that apply to our operations and activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our operations are subject to the tax laws  regulations and administrative practices of the united states  us state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business 
significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
for example  our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
substantial reform of us tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
risks related to our industry orthopedic device manufacturers have significant leverage over their independent suppliers and consolidation could increase their leverage  which could result in the loss of customers or force us to reduce our prices 
we compete with many distributors and manufacturers to develop and supply implants  surgical instruments and cases to a limited number of large orthopedic device manufacturers 
as a result  orthopedic device manufacturers have historically had significant leverage over their independent suppliers 
for example  independent suppliers like us are subject to continuing pressure from the major orthopedic device manufacturers to reduce the cost of products while maintaining quality levels 
in recent years  the medical device industry has experienced substantial consolidation 
if the medical device industry  and the orthopedic device industry in particular  continue to consolidate  competition to provide products to orthopedic device manufacturers may become more intense 
orthopedic device manufacturers may seek to use their market power to negotiate price or other concessions for our products 
if we are forced to reduce prices or if we lose customers because of competition  our revenue and results of operations would suffer 
our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment measures and other industry trends affecting pricing that could result in reduced sales of or prices for our products 
acceptance of our customers products by hospitals  outpatient centers and physicians depend on  among other things  reimbursement approval of third party payers such as medicaid  medicare and private insurers 
the continuing efforts of government  insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to lower reimbursement rates or non reimbursement for medical procedures that use our products 
if that were to occur  medical device manufacturers might insist that we lower prices on products related to the affected medical device or they might significantly reduce or eliminate their purchases from us of these related products  which could affect our profitability 
we and our customers are subject to substantial government regulation that is subject to change and could force us to make modifications to how we develop  manufacture and price our products 
the medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
some of our manufacturing processes are required to comply with quality systems regulations  including current good manufacturing practice requirements that cover the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging and shipping of our products 
further  some of our facilities  records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the fda or other agencies 

table of contents failure to comply with applicable medical device regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  repairs  replacements  refunds  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  refusal of the fda or other regulatory agencies to grant future pre market clearances or approvals  withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution 
in addition  orthopedic implants and other medical devices produced by our customers are subject to intensive regulation and potential pre approval requirements by the fda and similar international agencies that govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
compliance with these regulations may be time consuming  burdensome and expensive for our customers and  indirectly  for us to the extent that our customers compliance depends on our operations 
these regulations could negatively affect our customers abilities to sell their products  which in turn would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
this may result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue 
the regulations that we and our customers are subject to are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state levels 
in addition  these regulations may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and  to the extent we sell our products in foreign countries  we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations  higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue 
if our customers fail to obtain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  fda clearances or approvals to commercially distribute our future products our ability to sell our products could suffer 
some of our medical devices are subject to rigorous regulatory pre approval by the fda and other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
our customers are typically responsible for obtaining the applicable regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our products 
the process of obtaining this approval  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that our customers will obtain the required approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda  for example  assigns medical devices to one of three classes which determine  among other things  the type and degree of fda approval required to commercially distribute the device in the united states 
we produce class i  ii and iii devices 
class i devices are deemed to present little risk to patients and are generally exempt from fda approval requirements 
class ii devices can generally be commercially distributed only after the device has received k clearance 
the fda will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if certain design  testing and validation requirements are met and it is demonstrated that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that was legally marketed prior to may   or to another commercially available device subsequently cleared through the k pre market notification process 
this process generally takes three to six months  but may take substantially longer 
before a class iii device can be commercially distributed in the united states  a pre market approval  or pma  must be obtained from the fda 
the pma process can be expensive and uncertain  requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and other data and generally takes between one and three years  but may take significantly longer 
the commercial distribution of any products we develop that require regulatory clearance may be delayed 
in addition  because we cannot assure you that any new products or any product enhancements we develop for commercial distribution in the united states will be exempt from the fda market clearance requirements or subject to the shorter k clearance process  the regulatory approval process for our products or product enhancements may take significantly longer than anticipated by us or our customers 
we may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations 
if we violate 
table of contents or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could incur fines  penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
environmental laws tend to become more stringent over time  and we could incur material expenses in the future relating to compliance with future environmental laws 
in addition  we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third party waste disposal sites 
such costs could be material 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur material liabilities as a result of any contamination or injury 
us healthcare reform may impact our medical device customers or business adversely 
recent us house and senate bills contained multiple proposed changes which  if enacted  may impact our customers or our business directly 
one proposal included a ten year tax on medical device companies based on their current market share 
this tax is currently estimated at billion for the entire industry over a ten year period 
other proposals also include effectiveness trials and delivery system reforms as well as physician payment disclosures  among other changes 
in addition  the proposed changes may also include additional healthcare coverage for the uninsured 
it has been estimated that these increased insured could reach million within ten years 
while proposed legislation has not yet become law  it appears likely some changes will be forthcoming and it is difficult to determine the overall impact to our industry or our business 
risks relating to our common stock our common stock may be volatile and could decline substantially 
there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the medical device industry  including our company  which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
price declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  our announcements or our competitors announcements regarding new products  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic investments  loss of any of our key management or technical personnel  conditions affecting orthopedic device manufacturers or the medical device industry generally  product liability lawsuits against us or our customers  clinical trial results with respect or our customers medical devices  changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates  developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights  or those of our competitors  fda and international actions with respect to the government regulation of medical devices and third party reimbursement practices  public concern as to the safety of our products  changes in health care policy in the united states and internationally  conditions in the financial markets in general or changes in general economic conditions  our inability to raise additional capital  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  other comparable companies or the medical device industry generally  or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock  sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors and five percent stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock  
table of contents changes in accounting principles  and announcement of financial restatements 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities or financial restatements  litigation has often been brought against that company 
if litigation of this type is brought against us  it could be extremely expensive and divert management s attention and the corporation s resources 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law  our certificate of incorporation and our by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors 
these provisions include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  limiting the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  and authorizing of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and shares of our common stock 
we are also protected by section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or stockholder approvals were obtained 
as a result of our discovery of accounting irregularities at our sheffield  uk operating unit and the related restatement  the sec is conducting an informal investigation  which may not be resolved favorably 
following the discovery of the accounting irregularities at our sheffield  uk operating unit  the audit committee self reported the matter to the staff of the sec in october thereafter  the sec commenced an informal inquiry regarding this matter 
we have fully cooperated with the sec in its investigation 
at this time we are unable to predict the time period necessary to resolve the investigation or the ultimate resolution thereof 
to date  considerable legal  tax and accounting expenses have been incurred in connection with our audit committee s investigation into this matter and expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future with regard to the sec s investigation 
it is also possible that the investigation may continue to require management s time and attention and accounting and legal resources  which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
moreover  any action by the sec against us  or members of our management  may cause us to be subject to injunctions  fines and other penalties or sanctions or result in private civil actions  loss of key personnel or other adverse consequences and may require us to devote additional time and resources to these matters 
the investigation may adversely affect our ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the sec investigation and the remedies applied may affect certain of our business relationships and consequently may have an adverse effect on our business in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as a leading independent provider to orthopedic device manufacturers  we offer a broad range of products  including implants  instruments and cases as well as design and development services 
we also provide these types of products and services to companies in other segments of the medical device market  including dental  osteobiologic  and endoscopy sectors  and we provide limited specialized products to non healthcare markets  such as the aerospace industry 
we manufacture many of the products we sell and have manufacturing locations worldwide to service our global customer base 
we believe that our comprehensive product and services offering  our quality and regulatory expertise  our global resources and our size and capability provide us a competitive advantage 
we leverage these competitive advantages to accelerate our customers time to market as they develop and launch new products 
this relationship typically leads to an ongoing supply of products to our customers during the life of the product 
our core business strategy is built around our business model which leverages our global resources to expand our leadership position within the orthopedic sector as well as to diversify within related medical markets 
in the non orthopedic sector  we are expanding that core strategy by adding new distribution channels to reach even more end users of medical instruments  containers and related products 
using this strategy  we strive to provide the best possible customer experience by offering superior value  the highest quality  new technology  customized services  superior support  and the combination of our products and services into our total solutions offering 
historically  our growth has been driven organically from our core businesses as well as acquisitions designed to augment select areas of our business with more products  services  and technology 
the global medical device market was estimated to be approximately billion in  which was an increase from the billion in in revenues generated by sales of orthopedic products worldwide neared billion  an increase of over global revenues 
of the billion  or billion came from the ten largest orthopedic companies in the world 
the us orthopedic device market was billion in representing of the global medical device market 
growth for the us orthopedic device market alone is projected to be billion by orthopedic devices consist of reconstructive implants used to repair knees  hips  shoulders and other joints  as well as other orthopedic devices to repair bone fractures and the spine 
in  global sales of joint replacement products hips  knees  shoulders  elbows  wrists  digits exceeded billion  an increase of just under over sales generated in knees comprised the largest sub segment of the joint replacement market at billion followed by hips at billion 
geographically  sales in the us accounted for of global joint replacement revenue 
worldwide  spine procedure volumes exceeded three million in  including fusion  discectomy  disc replacement  vertebroplasty kyphoplasty and fracture repair 
in  sales of spine products excluding biologics approached billion worldwide  an increase of over revenues 
the six largest companies in the global spine market controlled sales in this segment 
we expect continued growth in the orthopedic device market to be driven by a number of trends including growing elderly population  aging  affluent and active baby boomers  improving technologies that expand the market  including minimally invasive surgery  successful clinical outcomes increasing patient confidence  increasing patient awareness through orthopedic device companies direct marketing programs  increasing volume of procedures to replace older implants or revision procedures  and developing international markets 
we offer our customers total solutions for complete implant systems implants  instruments and cases 
while our revenue to date has been derived primarily from the sale of implants  instruments  and cases separately  or instruments and cases together  our ability to provide total solutions for complete implant 
table of contents systems has already proven to be attractive to our customers  and we expect this capability will provide us with growth opportunities 
in addition  we expect that our total solutions capability will increase the relative percentage of value added products that we supply to our customers 
we believe that we have well established relationships with our major customers and these relationships  to a significant extent  involve the sale of products that we have developed or modified specifically for our customers particular product lines 
in connection with the launch of a new implant system  our customers typically provide a customized implant specific instrument set in cases to end users hospitals  outpatient centers and physicians for use with the new implant system 
as a result  our sales of instruments and cases in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new product launch activity by our customers 
our revenues are affected by changes in the number and size of orders and the timing of delivery dates 
our revenues have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to the effects of changes in inventory management practices and new product introductions by our customers 
despite our recent levels of revenue  we are optimistic about the future as the larger oems are increasingly focused on improving their supply chains 
this will result in fewer suppliers who in turn will be expected to provide a wider range of services coupled with high quality and reduced overall costs 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from increased oem outsourcing and consolidation of suppliers 
recently we have been engaged in more active and positive discussions with our customers to provide enhanced services 
while these strategic changes do not happen overnight  we continue to believe that we are in a favorable position to emerge as a supplier of choice for our major customers 
we believe our global capacity and competitive strengths will benefit us when the order volume and large project launches return  particularly within the dynamic and aging us population 
we have been focused on cost reduction and cash conservation for some time and are confident that further cost savings can be achieved 
we are reviewing all aspects of our operations to achieve these further cost reductions 
we believe the following actions will help position us for sustainable long term profitable growth

liquidity and capital resources current market conditions we are experiencing very challenging business conditions due to the overall economic environment that has resulted in reduced demand from our major oem customers 
our major oem customers continue to work down inventory levels and manage the timing of their product launch activity 
current global economic conditions have resulted in increased volatility in the financial markets 
during fiscal  we actively monitored the financial health of our supplier base  tightened requirements for customer credit  and increased spending controls across the company 
we will continue to monitor and manage these activities depending on current and expected market developments 
liquidity our principal sources of liquidity in fiscal were cash generated from operations 
principal uses of cash in fiscal included capital expenditures as well as debt service 
we expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to finance working capital  to pay for capital expenditures  to service debt and to fund possible future acquisitions 
in january  we obtained a new million term loan with a five year maturity to fund the million new bedford acquisition and to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash resources will permit us to stay committed to our strategic plan of increasing our share in the orthopedic market and expanding into other medical device segments 
in order to sustain profitability and cash flow during these current economic conditions  we have reduced our work force and compensation costs  renegotiated a key supply agreement for reduced material costs  implemented other cost control measures and consolidated certain operating facilities 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our senior credit agreement will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital  planned capital spending and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
the corporation s senior credit agreement  including the revolving credit facility  which has a balance of million at january   matures in june we have begun to explore refinancing alternatives to pay off the remaining balance and to establish adequate funds for future expansion

the applicable margin for borrowings under the amendment ranges from to for base rate borrowings and to for libor borrowings  subject to adjustment based on the average availability under the revolving credit facility 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are normally based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short time 
we enter into blank orders with vendors that have preferred pricing terms  however  these orders are normally cancelable by us without penalty 
amounts predominantly represent purchase agreements to buy minimum quantities of cobalt chrome and titanium through december this table does not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of million as reasonable estimates could not be made regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements include our operating leases and letters of credit  which are available under the senior credit facility

environmental our facilities and operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of hazardous materials  the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes  the cleanup of contamination  and the health and safety of our employees 
under such laws and regulations  we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
we could also be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third party waste disposal sites 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials  and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
we incurred approximately million and million in capital expenditures for environmental  health and safety in and  respectively 
during  purchases focused on two areas safety and environmental 
projects included purchases of new press controllers and emergency stops  wet dust collection systems and a nitric system 
during  our significant purchases included an ep passivate system and a wet dust collection system 
in connection with past acquisitions  we completed phase i environmental assessments and did not find any significant issues that we believe needed to be remediated 
we cannot be certain that environmental issues will not be discovered or arise in the future related to these acquisitions 
in conjunction with the new bedford acquisition  we purchased million of environmental insurance coverage for this facility 
this policy period expires january  while the insurance may mitigate the risk of certain environmental liabilities  we cannot guarantee that a particular liability will be covered by this insurance 
based on information currently available  we do not believe that we have any material environmental liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for our judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  which may be

revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on orders received from customers when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that is supportive of revenue recognition  the customer has made a fixed commitment to purchase the product for a fixed or determinable sales price  collection is reasonably assured under our normal billing and credit terms  and ownership and all risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer  which is normally upon shipment 
inventory 
inventories generally are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we review our inventory balances monthly for excess products or obsolete inventory levels and write down  if necessary  the inventory to net realizable value 
impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets 
the corporation assesses the impairment of definite lived long lived assets when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  undiscounted cash flows  or external appraisals  as applicable 
the corporation reviews long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist of technology  non compete and customer related intangible assets acquired in connection with our various acquisitions 
these assets are amortized using the straight line method 
the corporation is required to reassess the expected useful lives of existing intangible assets annually 
the corporation also evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets subject to amortization based on undiscounted operating cash flows when factors indicate impairment may exist 
in the event of impairment  the corporation makes appropriate write downs of recorded costs to fair value 
the corporation reviewed its amortizing intangible assets and has not recorded any impairment related to these assets for fiscal  or goodwill is not amortized but is periodically tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment 
potential impairment is determined by comparing estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit 
fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the corporation has multiple operating segments 
the corporation has defined its reporting units at the component of an operating segment as this is the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available and the operating results of that component are regularly reviewed by management 
the corporation completed its annual impairment testing and concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed for fiscal  or intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to review each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life as well as an annual impairment test in accordance with this statement 
the corporation reviewed its intangible assets and has not recorded any impairment related to these assets for fiscal  or the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects management s assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include future sales volume  prices  inflation  discount rates  exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates  as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific reporting unit to which the assets are attributed 
stock based compensation 
the corporation measures stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is 
table of contents recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for performance based awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
for restricted stock  the fair market value of the award is determined based upon the closing value of the corporation s stock price on the grant date 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the corporation estimates pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest 
income taxes 
the consolidated financial statements of the corporation have been prepared using the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for the expected future tax consequences of net operating losses  credits  and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
additionally  we use tax planning strategies as part of our global tax compliance program 
judgments and interpretation of statutes are inherent in this process 
the corporation provides related valuation reserves  where applicable  in accounting for uncertain tax positions 
interest and penalties associated with reserves for uncertain tax positions are classified in income tax expense in the statements of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of our fixed rate and variable rate debt and through the use of interest rate swaps 
the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at january   we had approximately million of variable rate debt 
the weighted average interest rate for this debt in was

commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities  such as titanium  stainless steel  cobalt chrome and aluminum 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can impact product costs 
to manage these fluctuations  we utilize competitive pricing methods such as bulk purchases  blanket orders and long term contracts with our major suppliers to reduce short term fluctuations 
for  we have entered into purchasing contracts on certain raw materials totaling million at fixed prices in order to manage our risk of commodity price movements 
additionally  we often do not set prices for our products in advance of our commodity purchases  therefore  we can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
in instances where we have supply agreements with customers  many of these agreements allow us to partially adjust prices for the impact of any raw material price increases 
however  to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be adversely affected
