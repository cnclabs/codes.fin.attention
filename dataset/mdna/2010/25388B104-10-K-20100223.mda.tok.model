as announced on october   symantec corporation has informed us that it has elected not to renew its e commerce agreement with us  which will result in the termination of the e commerce agreement on june  we expect a material decrease in revenue and operating income as a result of symantec s decision to not renew its e commerce agreement with us as symantec migrates its stores from our e commerce 
table of contents infrastructure to their internally developed e commerce platform 
however  as symantec has not yet informed us of its migration plans or the nature of the support symantec will require from us during the transition period  we are currently unable to predict the magnitude or timing of the revenue impact on our business  our future revenues and our operating results 
our intention is to moderate the impact on our consolidated financial results of the expected reduction in revenue through acquisition of new clients  organic growth within existing clients  new product and service introductions  cost saving initiatives and acquisition activities 
unless and until we generate sufficient new business to offset the loss of symantec  our financial results will be difficult or impossible to duplicate in we were incorporated in delaware in february our headquarters are located at west th street  eden prairie  minnesota and our telephone number is general information about us can be found at www 
digitalriver 
com under the company investor relations link 
our annual report on forms k  quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k  as well as any amendments or exhibits to those reports  are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with the securities and exchange commission 
current year results the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  this compared with net income of million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  net income was approximately million less and basic and diluted earnings per share were and less  respectively  than initially reported in the company s earnings press release and form k  both dated january  in performing its detailed review of the financial statements and notes at year end  management identified an additional adjustment associated with its january   convertible note repurchase 
after the company filed its year end press release it determined that a million non cash expense for debt financing costs million net of tax  previously deferred and amortized over the period of the note  was to be written off to earnings in conjunction with the note repurchase 
acquisitions and comparability of results we acquired netgiro systems ab in september  ia users club  inc dba customcd and digitalswift corporation in january and think subscription  inc in september the results of these acquisitions must be factored into any comparison of our results to the results for or see note of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for pro forma financial information as if these entities had been acquired on january  critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
we determine whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as net revenue 
we act as the merchant of record on most of the transactions processed and have contractual relationships with our clients  which obligate us to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
we derive our revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services rendered associated with the e commerce and other services provided to our clients and end customers 
our revenue is recorded net as generally our 
table of contents clients are subject to inventory risks and control customers product choices 
we sell both physical and digital products 
revenue is recognized upon fulfillment and based upon when products are shipped and title and significant risk of ownership passes to the customer 
we also provide customers with various proprietary software backup services 
we recognize revenue for these backup services based upon historical usage within the contract period of the digital backup services when this information is available 
digital backup services are recognized straight line over the life of the backup service when historical usage information is unavailable 
shipping revenues are recorded net of any associated costs 
we also  to a lesser extent  provide fee based client services  which include website design  custom development and integration  analytical marketing  affiliate marketing and email marketing services 
if we receive payments for fee based services in advance of delivery  these amounts  if significant  are deferred and recognized over the service period 
provisions for doubtful accounts and transaction losses and authorized credits are made at the time of revenue recognition based upon our historical experience 
the provision for doubtful accounts and transaction losses are recorded as charges to operating expense  while the provision for authorized credits is recognized as a reduction of net revenues 
the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
the company presents these taxes on a net basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates and assumptions that can affect the amount of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses we report in any financial reporting period 
we use estimates in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  which are based on our historical experience and current trends 
we must estimate the collectability of our billed accounts receivable 
we analyze accounts receivable and consider our historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
credit card chargeback reserve 
we use estimates based on historical experience and current trends to determine accrued chargeback expenses 
significant management judgments are used and estimates made in connection with these expenses in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment  amortize certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period of time over which the assets will generate revenue or benefit our business 
we review assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value we are carrying on our financial statements for an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation considers non financial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance 
if there are indications that impairment may be necessary  we use an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine the impairment amount  if any 
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be necessary utilizing a two step approach 
there have been no material impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years  and income taxes and deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record deferred tax assets for favorable tax attributes  including tax loss carryforwards 
we currently have us tax loss carryforwards  consisting solely of acquired operating tax loss carryforwards  and a lesser amount of acquired foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 
a 
table of contents portion of the benefit of the acquired tax loss carryforwards has been reserved by a valuation allowance pursuant to us gaap 
these valuation allowances of the deferred tax asset will be reversed if and when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
any future release of valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense 
as of december   we had us tax loss carryforwards of approximately million and foreign tax loss carryforwards of million 
these tax loss carryforwards consist solely of acquired net operating losses 
the us tax loss carryforwards expire in the years through however  we anticipate most us tax loss carryforwards will be utilized in the next few years 
there is uncertainty of future realization of the deferred tax assets resulting from acquired tax loss carryforwards due to anticipated limitations 
therefore  a valuation allowance was recorded against the tax effect of such tax loss carryforwards 
at december   the company has a valuation allowance on approximately million of deferred tax assets related to acquired operating losses and other tax attributes as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
any future release of this valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense 
no provision has been made for federal income taxes on approximately million of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december  since we plan to indefinitely reinvest all such earnings 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us income taxes on such earnings 
the amount of us income taxes would be subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and for the impact of the step up in the basis of assets resulting from an election made at the time of acquisition 
if these earnings were to be distributed  the income tax liability would be approximately million 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for share based payments made to our employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock grants and employee stock purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values under the provisions of asc stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized using the straight line amortization method over the vesting period 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
asc also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow 
stock based compensation expense of million  million and million was charged to operating expenses during  and  respectively 
see note for further information regarding the accounting for share based compensation

these tax loss carryforwards consist solely of acquired net operating losses 
the us tax loss carryforwards expire in the years through however  we anticipate most us tax loss carryforwards will be utilized in the next few years

table of contents as announced on october   symantec corporation has informed us that it has elected not to renew its e commerce agreement with us  which will result in the termination of the e commerce agreement on june  we expect a material decrease in revenue and operating profit as a result of symantec s decision to not renew its e commerce agreement with us 
however  as symantec has not yet informed us of its migration plans or the nature of the support symantec will require from us during the transition period  we are currently unable to predict the magnitude or timing of the revenue impact on our future revenues and our internal liquidity 
as of december   we held million of investments at par value  million fair value  in auction rate securities ars  all are aaa aaa rated and over collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government with the exception of one security which is rated aaa a and one security which is rated aaa aa all the securities are guaranteed by the department of education or the federal family education loan program ffelp with the exception of two securities which are and guaranteed by ffelp 
almost all of these securities continue to fail at auction due to illiquid market conditions 
the company determined a market value discount  due to current illiquid market conditions  was required and recorded a temporary fair value reduction of million of par value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on the december  balance sheet 
in  million of our ars were successfully liquidated at par 
as of december   the company adjusted the market value discount to million of par value through accumulated other comprehensive income 
the determination of fair value required management to make estimates and assumptions about the securities 
the discounted cash flow model we used to value the securities included the following assumptions determination of the penalty coupon rate  frequency of reset period associated with each ars an average redemption period of seven years a contribution of the ars paying its contractually stated interest rate determination of the risk adjusted discount rate based on libor rates for these maturities plus market information on student loan credit spreads in aggregate the ars portfolio is yielding and we continue to receive of the contractually required interest payments 
we continue to believe that we will be able to liquidate at par over time 
we do not intend to sell the investments prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis nor do we believe it is more likely than not we may be required to sell the investments prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis 
accordingly  we treated the fair value decline as temporary 
we anticipate we will have sufficient cash flow from operations to execute our business strategy and fund our operational needs 
we believe that capital markets are also available if we need to finance other investing alternatives 
see note for further information 
our principal commitments consist of interest and principal on our convertible senior notes and long term obligations outstanding under operating leases 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate continued capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to grow as our overall business grows and that operating expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december  payment due by period in thousands total amount and contractual obligations committed thereafter operating lease obligations convertible senior notes  including interest total with respect to our convertible senior notes due january  the notes  we are required to pay interest on the notes on january and july of each year so long as the notes are outstanding 
on january   we paid million in interest for the period july through december  the notes 
table of contents bear interest at a rate of and  if specified conditions are met  are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes may be surrendered for conversion under certain circumstances  including the satisfaction of a market price condition  such that the price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold  the satisfaction of a trading price condition  such that the trading price of the notes falls below a specified level  the redemption of the notes by us  the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  as defined in the related indenture  and the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the related indenture 
the initial conversion price is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  of principal amount of the notes 
we will adjust the conversion price if certain events occur  as specified in the related indenture  such as the issuance of our common stock as a dividend or distribution or the occurrence of a stock subdivision or combination 
holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes prior to maturity on january  and we have the right to redeem the notes at any time on or after january  on january   we announced that holders of of the notes exercised the option to require us to repurchase those notes on january  at a purchase price of of the principal amount of each tendered note 
notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately million remain outstanding 
in light of the right of holders to require us to redeem the notes on january   on january   we reclassified the notes as short term debt 
as such right has expired and the exercise of the next right to require us to redeem the notes will not occur until january   we have reclassified the remaining notes as long term debt 
we believe that existing sources of liquidity and the results of our operations will provide adequate cash to fund our operations and to repurchase the remaining notes  if necessary  although we may seek to raise additional capital 
in january  we filed a registration statement to increase our available shelf registration amount and we have approximately million available for future use 
in addition  we filed an acquisition shelf registration statement for up to approximately million shares 
in february  we filed a shelf registration that would allow us to sell an undetermined amount of equity or debt securities in accordance with the recently approved rules applying to well known seasoned issuers 
these filings were made to provide future flexibility for acquisition and financing purposes 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
outlook we believe the outlook for our business remains positive for global online sales continue to strengthen across most categories and buyers appear to be increasingly comfortable shopping online 
in our core markets  software  consumer electronics and games  trends continue to favor the migration toward online shopping 
additionally  we see opportunities to grow our share of business in adjacent and complementary markets such as business to business software and subscriptions management 
we also see opportunities to expand our core service offerings in areas such as payment processing and strategic marketing 
we anticipate that we will continue to reallocate resources in the first half of in support of our strategic growth initiatives and plan to implement cost savings initiatives by the end of the second quarter of which should begin to benefit the expense structure in the back half of the year 
we believe the initiatives outlined in our strategic plan will enable us to continue to be a leader in the software delivery market  strengthen our product and service offering by investing in our core business  continue to expand into new vertical markets such as consumer electronics  and computer and video games and supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions

for debt securities  the new guidance requires an entity to assess whether a it has the intent to sell the debt security  or b it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  an other than temporary impairment on the security must be recognized 
in instances in which a determination is made that a credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis exists but the entity does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis ie  the amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the new guidance changes the presentation and amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in the income statement 
when adopting the additional guidance related to asc  an entity is required to record a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized other than temporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income if the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis

 fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc provisions define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosure requirements 
the new guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants 
the guidance provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in relation to normal market activity 
in addition  when transactions or quoted prices are not considered orderly  adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be needed to determine the appropriate fair value 
the guidance also requires increased disclosures 
we adopted the new guidance for the period ending june   and it did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the required disclosures are included in note  fair value measurements

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments is maintained in a variety of securities  including government agency obligations and money market funds 
investments are classified as available for sale securities and carried at their market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the market value of certain securities in our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a hypothetical and immediate one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  and  by million and by million  respectively 
a hypothetical and immediate one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  and  by million and by million  respectively 
the approximate gains or losses in earnings are estimates  and actual results could vary due to the assumptions used 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of fixed rate contingent convertible debt outstanding 
foreign currency risk growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses 
conversely  our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
the effect on our consolidated statements of income from changes in exchange rates versus the us dollar is as follows in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  at prior exchange at prior exchange at prior exchange year rate as year rate as year rate as rates effect reported rates effect reported rates effect reported revenue costs and expenses income from operations represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results

changes in the fair value of these derivatives  as well as re measurement gains and losses  are recognized in current earnings in other expense  net 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were a gain of million in  a gain of million in and a loss of million in translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet
