company overview we are a development stage company focused on commercializing a patent portfolio for securing real time communications over the internet 
these patents were acquired by our principal operating subsidiary  virnetx  from science applications international corporation  or saic 
saic is a fortune scientific  engineering  and technology applications company that uses its deep domain knowledge to solve problems of vital importance to the nation and the world  in national security  energy and the environment  critical infrastructure  and health 
although we believe we may derive revenues in the future from our principal patent portfolio and are currently endeavoring to develop certain of those patents into marketable products  we have not done so to date 
because we have limited capital resources  our revenues are insignificant and our expenses  including but not limited to those we expect to incur in our patent infringement case against microsoft  are substantial  we may be unable to successfully complete our business plans  our business may fail and your investment in our securities may become worthless 
see risk factors for additional information 
we are in the development stage and consequently we are subject to the risks associated with development stage companies including the need for additional financings  the uncertainty that our patent and technology licensing program development efforts will produce revenue bearing licenses for us  the uncertainty that our development initiatives will produce successful commercial products as well as the marketing and customer acceptance of such products  competition from larger organizations  dependence on key personnel  uncertain patent protection  and dependence on corporate partners and collaborators 
to achieve successful operations  we will require additional capital to continue research and development and marketing efforts 
no assurance can be given as to the timing or ultimat e success of obtaining future funding

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the critical accounting policies we employ in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those which involve impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  fair value of financial instruments and stock based compensation 
impairment of long lived assets we identify and record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable  but not less than annually 
recoverability is measured by comparison of the anticipated future net undiscounted cash flows to the related assets carrying value 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the asset 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
fair value of financial instruments carrying amounts of our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities  approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
stock based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in the statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options based on estimated fair values 
using the modified retrospective transition method of adopting this standard  the financial statements presented herein reflect compensation expense for stock based awards as if the provisions of this standard had been applied from the date of our inception 
in addition  we record stock and options granted to non employees at fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity investments issued as they vest over the performance period 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the guidance must be ap plied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying the guidance at adoption is to be reported as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings for the year of adoption 
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes was effective for the first quarter of the adoption of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes did not have an impact to the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expanded disclosure about fair value measurements including valuing securities in markets that are not active 
the company adopted the framework for measuring fair value effective january  with the exception of the application of the framework to non recurring  non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
the adoption of the framework for measuring fair value did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in march  the fasb amended and expanded the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures about how and why the company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
these requirements were effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted the amended and expanded disclosure requirements for derivatives instruments and hedging activities as of january   and adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance requiring that unvested instruments granted in share based payment transactions that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities subject to the two class method of computing earnings per share 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb required disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements  effective for interim reporting periods ending after june   and required those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
the company adopted the new disclosure guidance over fair value of financial instruments  and adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued subsequent events 
under the new guidance  entities are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated  as well as the rationale for why that date was selected 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the company adopted the provisions of this new guidance as of june   and adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the company evaluated subsequent events through march  in june  the fasb established the accounting standards codification codification as the single source of authoritative gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities  except for the rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
while not intended to change gaap  the codification significantly changes the way in which the accounting literature is referenced and organized 
the codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the codification was adopted as of august  adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
operations revenue royalties revenue generated for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to  during the period from july  the closing date of the merger between us and virnetx  inc to december  our revenue in was solely limited to the royalties earned under a single license agreement through our japanese subsidiary 
we expect the revenue from this license to decrease substantially in the future 
we do not intend to enter into additional licenses or generate significant revenue through our japanese subsidiary 
research and development expenses research and development costs include expenses paid to outside development consultants and compensation related expenses for our engineering staff 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses increased from  for the period from august  date of inception to december   to  for to  for to  for  and to  for  primarily as a result of increased engineering activities for product development 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as employees are hired to provide in house research and development 
because we expect to use outside contractors for additional product development on a limited basis  we expect those costs to remain level or decline over time 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include management and administrative personnel costs  as well as costs of outside legal  accounting  and consulting services 
our general and administrative expenses increased from  for the period from august  date of inception to december   to  for to  for  to  for  and to  for within general and administrative expenses  professional fees  primarily legal fees  increased from  in the period from august  date of inception to december  to  in to  in to  in and to  in the fees were incurred to pursue the litigation with microsoft  assist in the merger between virnetx  inc and virnetx holding corporation  audit the financial statements  assist in obtaining financing and potential contract negotiations and in general corporate matters 
although we view the mckool smith fixed fee arrangement as a positive arrangement and one that will help us manage our expenses in connection with the microsoft litigation  we anticipate that our legal fees and other expenses associated with this litigation wi ll be material and will negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
also within general and administrative  compensation expenses increased from  in the period from august  date of inception to december   to  in   in   in and  in compensation expenses were higher in compared to due to the higher proportion of stock based compensation expense in the increases from to in compensation expenses are due principally to stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to our employees and directors and an increase in the number of our employees as we added resources to comply with financial reporting requirements 
other general and administrative expenses increased from  in the period from august  date of inception to december  to  in to  in  to  in and decreased to  for  as we incurred costs related to building our infrastructure and litigation support 
we also incurred additional general and administrative expenses in connection with the implementation of a directors and officers insurance policy and certain other costs 
the decrease in in due primarily to reduced cost in public relations  outsourced services  printing and other costs 
liquidity and capital resources we are in the development stage and have raised capital since our inception through the issuance of our equity securities 
as of december   we had a working capital deficiency of approximately  and approximately  in cash 
subsequent to year end through march   we have received approximately  from the exercise of warrants 
we have used the net proceeds to fund our operations and provide working capital for general corporate purposes 
we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through proceeds from equity or debt financings  loans  joint ventures  and or collaborative agreements with corporate and strategic partners 
we also intend to license our patent portfolio  technology and software  including our secure domain name registry service 
we expect to derive the majority of our revenue from license fees and royalties associated with our patent portfolio  technology and software 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  including the proceeds from the completed exercises of warrants noted above are insufficient to fund our operations for longer than through the end of our third quarter of during  our cash flow used in operations was  or an average of approximately  per month 
during the fourth quarter of  our cash balance used in operations increased on average to  per month 
with our average monthly cash requirement including the impact of a reduction of our working capital deficit at december   we expect our average monthly cash flow used in operations in will be modestly greater than in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable off balance sheet arrangements on june   we entered into an engagement letter with mckool smith  confirming mckool as our lead counsel in the february lawsuit against microsoft corporation 
mckool has agreed to represent us in the microsoft litigation for a fixed fee of million and a contingency fee of of the litigation proceeds 
in the event of a judgment or settlement below an agreed upon amount designed to approximate the total legal fees associated with the matter  mckool s fixed fee will be limited to the actual time spent by mckool  up to a maximum of million  plus the contingency fee of of the litigation proceeds 
mckool s out of pocket expenses are not capped pursuant to the engagement letter but are estimated to be approximately million
