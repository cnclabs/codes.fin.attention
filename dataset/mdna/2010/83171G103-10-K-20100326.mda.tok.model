item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
certain statements in this discussion and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of see forward looking statements following the table of contents of this k 
because this discussion involves risk and uncertainties  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we measure our operations using both financial and other metrics 
the financial metrics include revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and income from continuing operations 
other key metrics include i revenues by sales source  ii online sales  iii cash flows and iv ebitda 
some of the most significant trends affecting our business are the following the increasing recognition by professionals and corporations that they must continually improve their skills and those of their employees in order to remain competitive  continuing and expanding professional education requirements by governing bodies  including states and professional associations  the plethora of new laws and regulations affecting the conduct of business and the relationship between employers and their employees  the increased competition in today s economy for skilled employees and the recognition that effective training can be used to recruit and train employees  the development and acceptance of the internet as a delivery channel for the types of products and services we offer  and current economic conditions 
over the last five years  our annual revenues have grown from million to million 
this growth is due in large part to eight acquisitions that we have completed in this period 
our most recent acquisition was executive enterprise institute eei in july eei is a leading provider of live training to corporate financial professionals and attorneys  and complements the live training that loscalzo provides to accountants 
eei s live training is marketed directly to larger corporations and through associations  such as fei 
we intend to continue focusing on acquisitions that will allow us to increase the breadth and depth of our current product offerings  including the general corporate market for compliance  governance and ethics 
we will also consider acquisitions that will give us access to new markets and products 
we prefer acquisitions that are accretive  as opposed to those that are dilutive  but ultimately the decision will be based on maximizing shareholder value rather than short term profits 
the size of the acquisitions will be determined  in part  by our size  the capital available to us  and the liquidity and price of our stock 
we may use debt to enhance or augment our ability to consummate larger transactions 
there are many risks involved with acquisitions  some of which are discussed in item of part of this report above under the caption certain risk factors that may affect our growth and profitability 
these risks include identifying appropriate acquisition candidates  successfully negotiating the business  legal and financial terms of the acquisitions  integrating the acquired business into our existing operations and corporate structure  retaining key employees  and minimizing disruptions to our existing business 
we cannot assure that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities or negotiate reasonable terms or that any acquired business or assets will deliver the shareholder value that we anticipated at the outset 
with respect to our performance for the recently completed fiscal year  while we were able to increase revenue  our expenses increased at a faster rate 
the increase in revenue was attributable primarily to our accounting finance division  our financial services training division  skye and our consulting business 
all our other divisions and subsidiaries experienced a reduction in revenue 
the increase in accounting finance revenue is attributable almost entirely to loscalzo  which had its first full year of operations  and eei  which we acquired in mid year 
the decrease in revenue experienced by our other operating units  we believe was almost entirely attributable to general economic conditions 
as the overall business environment improves  we expect these units to increase their level of business as well 
on the expense side  loscalzo and eei were significant factors in the increase as well 
to offset these increases  which were anticipated  we reduced staff in other areas of our operations and restructured various compensation arrangements where possible 
we will continue to closely monitor our direct and general and administrative costs and make the necessary adjustments where warranted 
for example  we are committed to installing a new telecommunications system  at a cost of approximately  which we believe will result in future savings in our operating costs 
seasonality and cyclicality historically  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter  primarily because a portion of our business is non subscription based 
custom jobs and consulting work are subject to both the general business climate and client s needs 
our engineering revenue is subject to staffing levels in both the private and public sector 
in economic downturns  staff reductions result in fewer people taking professional engineering licensing exams 
our subscription based revenue is spread over the life of the subscription  which is generally one year and can be effected by staff reductions  as well 
with our acquisition of loscalzo and eei  these quarterly fluctuations have become more evident and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
both loscalzo and eei generate most of their revenue from live training programs 
in eei s case  the revenue is recognized almost exclusively in the second and fourth quarters  when the sessions take place 
in loscalzo s case  the revenue tends to be recognized over the second  third and fourth quarters  with the fourth quarter revenue being the greatest 
while the costs that are directly related to the production of this revenue are expensed over the same period  both loscalzo and eei have general and administrative expenses that are incurred ratably over the year  creating the fluctuations in our operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition 
revenues a large portion of our revenues is in the form of subscription fees for any of our monthly accounting update programs or access to our library of accounting  financial services training and legal courses 
other sources of revenue include direct sales of programs or courses on a non subscription basis or from various forms of live training  fees for web site design  software development  tape and dvd duplication  video production  video conversion  course design and development  ongoing maintenance of the pec  and licensing fees 
subscriptions are billed on an annual basis  payable in advance and deferred at the time of billing 
sales made over the internet are by credit card only 
renewals are usually sent out days before the subscription period ends 
larger transactions are usually dealt with by contract  the financial terms of which depend on the services being provided 
revenues from subscription services are recognized as earned  deferred at the time of billing or payment  and amortized into revenue on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription 
engineering products are non subscription based and revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product  or in the case of online sales  payment 
revenues from live training are recognized when earned  usually upon the completion of the seminar or conference 
revenues from non subscription services provided to customers  such as web site design  video production  consulting services and custom projects  are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis where sufficient information relating to project status and other supporting documentation is available 
the contracts may have different billing arrangements resulting in either unbilled or deferred revenue 
we obtain either a signed agreement or purchase order from our non subscription customers outlining the terms and conditions of the sale or service to be provided 
otherwise  these services are recognized as revenues after completion and delivery to the customer 
duplication and related services are generally recognized upon shipment or  if later  when our obligations are complete and realization of receivable amounts is assured 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  goodwill and certain intangible assets annually for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
upon completing our review and testing for the current period we believe that we have not incurred any impairment to such assets stock based compensation we have adopted the recognition and measurement requirements of accounting standards codification asc the codification topic that discuss stock based compensation 
as a result  compensation costs are recognized in the financial statements for stock options or grants awarded to employees and directors 
options and warrants granted to non employees are recorded as an expense at the date of grant based on the then estimated fair value of the security granted 
segment reporting all of our operations constitute a single segment  that of educational services 
revenues from non educational services  such as video production are not a material part of our operating income 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and the following table compares our statement of operations data for the years ended december   and december  the trends suggested by this table may not be indicative of future operating results  which will depend on various factors including the relative mix of products sold accounting finance  engineering or corporate training and the method of sale video or online 
year ended december amount percentage amount percentage change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income before provision for benefit for income taxes income tax provision benefit net income net revenues net revenues for increased compared to net revenues for  primarily as a result of the acquisition of eei and a full year of loscalzo acquired july 
online revenues continue to be an important factor contributing to our overall revenue growth 
in both and  net revenues from online sales of subscription based products and other sales accounted for approximately and million  or of our net revenues  respectively 
although online revenues have increased in total dollars  as a percentage of total net revenues  it has remained flat 
net revenues from sales of our accounting finance products grew in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  primarily as a result of the eei acquisition and a full year of operations by loscalzo 
in  net revenues from our accounting finance and related products were million  compared to million in in each of and  net revenues from accounting finance products  including both subscription and non subscription based revenue  was and million  respectively 
net revenues from live training  custom work and advertising were million in  as compared to million in the difference is primarily attributable to loscalzo and eei 
net revenues from sales of our engineering products  which are not subscription based  were  in  compared to  in the decrease in engineering sales is due to current economic conditions  as engineering firms and governmental agencies have reduced personnel and curtailed spending 
net revenues from video production  duplication and consulting services increased in by  to  from  in  as a result of increased consulting work 
video production and duplication income fluctuates annually  but overall they continue to decline 
the duplication business has declined because tape is no longer used and we do not have the capability of doing very large dvd duplication jobs 
our video production facility is primarily used for internal work and income results from the renting of our facilities and or our equipment 
consulting work varies from year to year  and sales are credited to the department from which they originate and not to the department where the work is performed 
net revenues from sle decreased from million in to  in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of  from our cognistar legal division  and a decrease of  from our ethics division 
the decrease in cognistar sales is due to the economy as many law firms have reduced staff and cut budgets 
the ethics division s income is from custom consulting jobs and economic conditions have curtailed spending in that area  as well 
skye generated million of net revenues in  as compared to million in skye produces customized training and educational material for the pharmaceutical industry  professional firms  financial service companies and others 
our financial services training division generated net revenues of million in  as compared to only million in the largest portion of the growth comes from financialcampus course sales  which are delivered over the internet 
our technology training product watchit  acquired in august  generated net revenues of  in  as compared to  of revenues in cost of revenues cost of revenues includes i production costs  such as the salaries  benefits and other costs related to personnel  whether employees or independent contractors  who are used directly in connection with producing or conducting our educational programs  ii royalties paid to third parties  iii the cost of materials  such as dvds  printed matter and packaging materials  and iv shipping costs 
compared to  cost of revenues in increased by approximately million 
this increase is a result of a full year of costs for loscalzo  costs directly related to eei and business that required a substantial amount of outsourcing in order to complete projects 
cost of revenues in increased to from in  resulting in a decrease in our gross profit margin 
with the addition of loscalzo and eei  which together represent approximately of our current net revenues  we anticipate a lower gross profit percentage as these businesses are more labor and cost intensive than our subscription based products 
there are many different types of expenses that are characterized as production costs and they vary from period to period depending on many factors 
the expenses that showed the greatest variations from to and the reasons for those variations were as follows outside labor and direct production costs 
outside labor includes the cost of hiring actors and production personnel  such as directors  producers and cameramen and the outsourcing of non video technology 
it also includes the costs of instructors for live training and the production of those courses 
these costs increased by  in from both skye and our consulting technology departments employ a number of consultants to write scripts  edit course material and provide technology services 
loscalzo and eei employ a number of consultants to develop course material in addition to hiring instructors to deliver programs throughout the united states 
we have been outsourcing some of the programming and content development functions that were previously done by our employees to firms in india and china at a substantial savings 
we are always exploring other areas  such as the philippines  for outsourcing our technology needs 
direct production costs  which are costs related to producing videos other than labor costs such as the cost of renting equipment and locations  and the purchase of materials increased by  these variations are related to the type of video production and custom projects and do not reflect any trends in our business 
salaries 
overall payroll and related costs attributable to production personnel increased by approximately  the increase was primarily attributable to salaries and related costs from our recent acquisitions offset by decreases in other areas  such as video production tape duplication and our technology group 
while our sle salaries and related costs decreased by  this was offset by increased salaries from skye of approximately  in from royalties 
royalty expense was relatively flat in as compared to this was due to increased royalties in accounting education offset by an equal decrease in engineering products 
we often have to estimate the royalty expense due our partners  as the information may not be available 
if volume increases or if we enter into new agreements or modify existing agreements  the actual royalty payments in under these agreements may be either higher or lower than they were in other costs 
travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses increased by  primarily related to loscalzo  eei and some custom projects 
the largest component of these expenses is travel and entertainment that increased by  in from  offset by a reduction in shipping costs of  as a result of converting to dvd from videotape 
loscalzo and skye often bill their customers for travel 
as our business grows we may be required to hire additional production personnel  increasing our cost of revenues 
selling general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include corporate overhead  such as i compensation and benefits for administrative  sales and marketing and finance personnel  ii rent  iii insurance  iv professional fees  v travel and entertainment  and vi office expenses 
general and administrative expenses in were higher than they were in by  overhead expenses directly attributable to loscalzo and eei  which include marketing expenses  rent  salaries and related costs and other costs was approximately  exclusive of these increases  other overhead expenses decreased approximately  primarily due to reduced salaries and related costs 
in addition  in conformity with applicable accounting standards  we are expensing the costs associated with the grants of option and restricted stock to employees and directors 
this non cash expense was  in and  in we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in as we fully absorb the eei acquisition with its substantial marketing expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were  higher in than they were in the increase is attributable to intangible assets acquired in the loscalzo and eei transactions  as well as and the capitalization of intangible assets developed internally  principally our new pec 
the total cost of the intangible assets acquired in the loscalzo and eei transaction was approximately  of which approximately  is being amortized over various periods ranging from three to years 
the total capitalized cost of our new pec is  and is being amortized over five years 
as we are always upgrading our computer hardware and systems  and because we have a number of projects in development  we expect our depreciation and amortization expenses on our fixed and intangible assets to increase 
operating income for  operating income was  compared to million in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of net revenues  operating income in was compared to in  a decrease of 
our acquisition of eei in the second half of  as well as a decrease in revenue from our legal and ethics division and our engineering division  has contributed to the decrease in operating income 
other income other income and expense items primarily consist of interest earned on deposits 
we currently have no outstanding debt  other than normal trade payables 
net interest income decreased by  due to the fact that interest rates were significantly lower in compared to we do not anticipate an increase in interest income as interest rates continue to remain very low in income tax provision benefit in  we recorded a net tax expense of  compared to a  benefit in we have analyzed all of the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million after a valuation allowance of approximately  as compared to a net deferred tax asset of million in the prior year 
the current period expense consisted of net federal income tax benefit of  offset by state and local taxes of approximately  in the prior period  we recorded a tax benefit of  after recording a net federal tax benefit of  offset by state and local taxes of  in and we recorded a net tax benefit after evaluating our estimated taxable income for each ensuing five year period 
our estimates were based on a number of factors including prevailing economic conditions and the effect of recent acquisitions on future earnings 
we have estimated that our net income will increase by in and by per year for each of taking into account various factors including the pace of the recovery from the recent recession and the impact of differences between financial and tax accounting on our taxable income during the years in question 
net income for  we recorded net income of  compared to million for our net profit margin for was  compared to in  a decrease of 
the decrease in net income is primarily due to a decrease in gross profit  higher general and administrative expenses  as well as lower interest income 
in addition  we recognized a net tax expense in  as compared to a tax benefit in liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our working capital requirements through internally generated funds  sales of equity and debt securities  and proceeds from short term bank borrowings 
at year end  we had no indebtedness for borrowed money 
our working capital as of december   was approximately million  compared to a million working capital as of december  the increase is attributable to positive cash flow from operations offset by cash used to pay the former shareholders of skye their contingent payment 
our current ratio at december   is to  compared to to at december  the current ratio is derived by dividing current assets by current liabilities and is a measure used by lending sources to assess our ability to repay short term liabilities 
the largest component of our current liabilities  approximately million and million at december   and respectively  is deferred revenue  which is revenue collected or billed but not yet earned under the principles of revenue recognition 
most of this revenue is in the form of subscription fees and will be earned over the next months 
the cost of fulfilling our monthly subscription obligation does not exceed this revenue and is booked to expense as incurred 
for some of our products  there are no additional costs  other than shipping costs  required to complete this obligation as the material is already in our library 
for the year ended december   we had a net increase in cash of  we generated million in cash from operations  offset by million in investing activities  including  for additional purchase consideration paid for the acquisition of skye   for eei  and the balance for purchases or internal development of various capital assets 
in addition  we expended  for the purchase of treasury shares 
the primary components of our operating cash flows are our net income adjusted for non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  and the changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and deferred revenues 
in comparison  for the year ended december   we had a million decrease in cash 
that decrease was a result of cash generated by operations of million offset by cash expended for investing activities of million  primarily for acquisitions of million and  for various asset acquisitions or internal capitalization of intangibles 
we also expended  in financing activities primarily for the purchase of treasury shares of  offset by cash generated from the exercise of options and warrants and other of  capital expenditures for the year ended december   were approximately  of which  consisted primarily of computer equipment  most of which was for our off site backup center  a requirement of sox compliance 
we capitalized  of costs for the production of various courses and  for capitalizing the costs of our new pec and other products 
we are constantly reviewing and upgrading our technology 
for fiscal  we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures other than software and course development costs  including  budgeted to upgrade our telecommunications platform 
in march  we purchased  shares of our common stock for approximately  in addition  we declared a dividend of 
per common share payable april   to shareholders of record on april  contractual obligation  commitments and contingencies as of december   we had commitments under various leases for our offices in hawthorne  new york  the sle office in westborough  massachusetts  skye s offices in bridgewater  new jersey  and loscalzo s office in red bank  new jersey 
the total aggregate commitment under these leases is approximately million through january sle recently entered into a new lease that expires in january with monthly rent of approximately  the skye lease was recently extended to january at a base monthly rent of  and the lease for the loscalzo office expires on june   at a monthly rent of  in the future  we may issue additional debt or equity securities to satisfy our cash needs 
any debt incurred or issued may be secured or unsecured  at a fixed or variable interest rate and may contain other terms and conditions that our board of directors deems prudent 
any sales of equity securities may be at or below current market prices 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in generating sufficient capital to adequately fund our liquidity needs 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates 
as we may hold us treasury securities or money market funds  we may be exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve 
credit risk most of our cash is held in deposit accounts  us treasury and non treasury money market funds 
our bank deposit accounts are insured by the us government  but only up to a maximum of  at any one bank 
our money market funds are held in a brokerage account that is insured by the security industry protection corp up to  and various brokerage firms may carry additional insurance from commercial insurance companies 
our cash balances vary from time to time based on a variety of factors  but in most cases are significantly in excess of the insurable limit 
as a result  we have exposure on these accounts in the event these financial institutions become insolvent 
in addition  we may have credit risk with respect to customers who default on custom orders or who default on subscription payments 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  the codification 
the codification is a single source of authoritative us nongovernmental generally accepted accounting principles 
the codification does not change generally accepted accounting principles  but is intended to make it easier to find and research issues and changes the way gaap is referenced 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  we began to use the new codification when referring to gaap in our financial statements for the third quarter of in may  the fasb issued acs  the subsequent events topic that provides guidance on management s assessment of subsequent events 
this standard establishes the accounting and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
this section is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  in accordance with the codification  we reviewed the events for inclusion in the financial statements through the filing date of this form k 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
