item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in this section of the form k  entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we attempt to give you a look at our company through the eyes of management so that you can assess the financial condition and results of operations of our company 
the discussion that follows should give you information that will help you understand our business and its performance 
we intend for the discussion to be clear and to explain the drivers of our results so that you can assess the quality of our earnings and the predictability of our future results 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results includes hillenbrand  inc hillenbrand and those of its operating segments  batesville services  inc batesville and k tron international  inc 
k tron  together with their wholly owned subsidiaries 

table of contents results of operations the consolidated operating results of our company are included in the selected financial data in part ii  item of this form k 
we have disaggregated the relevant operating information into our two reporting segments  batesville and k tron  along with our corporate operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for a reconciliation of the financial information below to our consolidated financial results 
the sections that follow present comparative operating results for batesville  k tron  and our corporate operations 
we also discuss changes in non operating expenses and income  along with our income tax provision  in further detail below 
batesville results fiscal year ended september  of of of amounts in millions amount revenue amount revenue amount revenue revenue gross profit operating expenses operating income depreciation and amortization batesville fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue batesville s net revenues for the year were down from the same period last year  decreasing million or 
burial unit volume decreased or million compared to the same period last year and was the primary contributor to the reduction in net revenue  although improved volume on non burial products helped limit the impact 
we believe the volume decrease is attributable to a lower number of reported deaths year over year and increased cremation rates 
offsetting this impact was a modest increase in average selling price that contributed million to revenue 
we believe that batesville s merchandising initiatives and new product launches helped improve average selling prices and slow the downward trend in product mix  especially in customer locations that used the batesville merchandising system 
finally  batesville also experienced the favorable impact of currency fluctuations during the year as it benefited from a strengthening canadian dollar 
this resulted in increased revenue of million over the prior year 
we can t predict how currency rates will move and they may either help or hurt our results in the future 
gross profit batesville s gross profit for the year was up from the same period last year  increasing million or 
in addition to the impacts noted above  cost of goods sold decreased million 
in batesville s manufacturing operations  costs decreased million  driven by a million decrease due to lower volume and an million decrease due to lower commodity costs 
although full year commodity prices have been favorable overall  more recently batesville has been paying more for commodities as compared to levels at september  these favorable effects were partially offset by million of cost increases attributable to a number of other categories across manufacturing operations 
within its distribution operations  batesville generated million in cost efficiencies associated with lower personnel  benefit costs  and outside carrier costs 
the effects of higher fuel rates were evenly offset by million of lower costs across batesville s remaining distribution related cost categories 
we are continuing to optimize our cost structure utilizing lean business principles 

table of contents operating expenses batesville operating expenses increased million or for the year as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the primary drivers of the cost increases were million related to variable compensation and pension  million due to higher legal fees related to antitrust litigation  million of additional spending on new business initiatives  and million spread over to a number of other components of batesville s operating expenses 
during the three months ended december   it was discovered that batesville over remitted sales tax in certain jurisdictions and  as a result  recorded a million sales tax receivable related to these overpayments 
in the quarter ended september   batesville recognized an additional recovery of million related to these over payments  the effect of which lowered operating expenses compared to the same three month period in the prior year 
batesville fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue batesville s net revenues for fiscal were down from the same period in fiscal  decreasing million or 
burial unit volume decreased or million compared to the same period in fiscal and was the primary contributor to the reduction in net revenue 
we believe this volume decrease was attributable to a lower number of reported deaths year over year  increased cremation rates  and aggressive price competition 
we suspect that higher cremation rates were fueled by the onset of the economic recession which in turn caused the aggressive price competition for the remaining volume 
offsetting this impact was an increase in average selling price that contributed million to revenue 
finally  during fiscal  the unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations from a stronger us dollar  mainly compared to the canadian dollar resulted in decreased revenue of million from the prior year 
gross profit batesville s gross profit for the year was down from the same period last year  decreasing million or 
in addition to the revenue impacts noted above  cost of goods sold decreased million 
in batesville s manufacturing operations  million of lower costs were due to the unfavorable impact of lower volume 
additionally  higher commodity costs of million for steel and red metals offset cost savings of million attributable to a number of other categories across manufacturing operations 
during fiscal  batesville s distribution operations benefited from a million reduction in fuel cost as compared to the prior year 
it also experienced a million decrease in other distribution cost categories which were mainly related to lower employee benefit costs in similar fashion to its manufacturing operations 
operating expenses batesville s operating expenses decreased million or for fiscal year as compared to the same period in the prior year 
in fiscal  batesville realized a million decrease in its bad debt expense as a result of collecting a customer balance that had previously been nearly fully reserved causing fiscal expense to be relatively higher 
this increased expense was offset by a decrease in variable compensation of million tied to lower fiscal revenues and a decrease of million in legal fees related to antitrust litigation 
the remaining decrease in core operating expenses of million was attributable to other components of batesville s operating expense categories 
k tron results fiscal year ended september  representing six months of operations since date of acquisition on april  amounts in millions amount of revenue revenue gross profit operating expenses operating income depreciation and amortization 
table of contents results for k tron since we have only recently acquired k tron  we do not present comparative period results for variance analysis 
k tron s results for the last six months of fiscal were significantly impacted by the non recurring effects of the step ups in value to inventories and backlog eg the value of firm orders which are not yet complete for our customers required by acquisition accounting 
these step ups are being charged against income over the turnover period of the related inventories and acquired backlog 
these step ups reduced gross profit and operating income by million and million  respectively  and increased operating expenses and amortization by million 
the future revenue associated with k tron s business lines is influenced by order backlog 
this is typical for these business lines because of the lead time involved in manufacturing specialized equipment and parts for customers 
backlog can be an indicator of future revenue 
however  it may not include many projects and parts orders that are booked and shipped within a quarter eg it is substantially new equipment orders 
the timing of order placement  size  and customer delivery dates can create unusual fluctuations in backlog 
backlog is also affected by foreign exchange fluctuations since a portion of the orders are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
when we acquired k tron  backlog was approximately million 
based upon new orders accepted  less orders completed and shipped during the last six months of fiscal  k tron s backlog was approximately million as of september  revenues in the last six months of fiscal exceeded the orders placed for future delivery  causing the reduction in backlog as of the end of the year 
the backlog decrease was largely driven by the completion of a multi million dollar order during the fourth quarter of fiscal corporate results fiscal year ended september  amounts in millions operating expenses business acquisition costs restructuring costs separation costs depreciation and amortization excluding business acquisition  restructuring  and separation costs 
corporate fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  operating expenses we have excluded business acquisition  restructuring and separation costs because we believe this provides a clearer picture for analyzing our operating cost structure without the effects of these activities due to the significant and infrequent nature of these costs 
operating expenses increased million or for the year as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increases were primarily related to employee compensation and benefits costs of million and variable compensation costs of million which were offset by aggregate cost decreases of million across other components of our corporate operations 
business acquisition costs during fiscal  we incurred million of business acquisition related costs  of which million are included in our corporate costs for the fiscal year ended september  these non recurring acquisition costs include advisory  legal  accounting  valuation  and other professional and consulting fees that are directly attributable to our acquisition of k tron 
restructuring costs during fiscal  we incurred restructuring charges of million related to our joint ownership interests in corporate aircraft that were distributed to us in connection with our separation from hill rom 
these restructuring charges resulted from our collective plans with hill rom to sell or dispose of two of four of our jointly owned aircraft  and modifications to our aviation access and use agreements 
the charges consist of million in asset impairments related to two aircraft and approximately million related to severance 
this restructuring will optimize our future cost structure with our intended use of these aviation assets 

table of contents corporate fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  operating expenses during fiscal  we substantially completed building teams and processes to support ourselves as a stand alone public company 
we also initiated our acquisition strategy and put in place people  processes  and resources to enable successful execution of that strategy 
as a result of these activities  we incurred an increase in corporate operating costs of million in fiscal as compared to the previous year 
this increase was partially offset by the fact that we were no longer allocated corporate costs from hill rom effective april  these allocated costs decreased by in fiscal compared to the prior year 
separation costs in fiscal year  we incurred or were allocated million in separation costs associated with the separation of the company from hill rom 
included in these non recurring costs were million tied to the acceleration of previously unvested stock grants  million in stock option modification charges  and million of investment banking and advisory fees 
the balance of the costs were primarily legal and professional fees 
other income and expense fiscal year ended september  amounts in millions interest expense investment income and other interest expense interest expense increased million for the year ended september   as compared to the same period in the prior year  due to increased borrowings on our revolving credit facilities resulting from the acquisition of k tron and issuance of year  fixed rate senior unsecured notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal our revolving credit facility had an average weighted interest rate for fiscal of as compared to for fiscal fiscal marked our first full year as a stand alone public company and our first full year of financing costs under our credit facility 
since our separation from hill rom and generally throughout fiscal  we had been paying down the credit facility 
as a result of the lower average daily balances and the fact that we had lower weighted average interest rates  our costs decreased in fiscal over the same period in the prior year 
the weighted average interest rate of the credit facility was and during the fiscal years and  respectively 
investment income and other investment income and other increased million for the year ended september  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the primary driver of the increase was higher earnings from investments in limited partnerships in the current year  as compared to losses in the prior year which resulted primarily from decreased values on investments held by the limited partnerships 
this increase in investment income was partially offset by decreased interest income and realized losses and impairments on the sale of auction rate securities and lower interest income on our note receivable from forethought forethought note 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for more detailed information 
as was the case with interest expense described above  in fiscal we incurred our first full year of investment earnings or losses from assets that were transferred to us by hill rom at the time of the separation 
during fiscal year  net losses from investments in affiliates limited partnership investments were million due to decreased values within the affiliates investment portfolios 
in comparison  we had no net earnings or losses from these investments in fiscal however  in the last quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million other than temporary impairment loss on an investment in common stock 
we earned higher interest income of million  in aggregate  on the ars and forethought note as compared to the prior year due to the fact that we held them for only six months in the previous year 
we also received a right the put from ubs financial services that allowed us to sell a portion of our existing ars in the future 
since that time  we have been recording changes in the fair value of the put and applicable ars through our income statement and as expected  they essentially offset 
see the information within the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k and other liquidity matters included within liquidity and capital resources discussed below 

table of contents income tax expense fiscal year ended september  amounts in millions income tax expense effective tax rate income taxes our income tax rate was for the year ended september   an increase of over the same period in the prior year 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to non deductible business acquisition costs  higher state income tax rates  and adjustments resulting from periodic reconciliation of our tax accounts to subsequent tax filings 
these effects were somewhat offset by favorable changes in our income tax reserves 
our income tax rate for fiscal was  which was lower than the prior year 
this reduction was primarily due to separation costs we incurred in fiscal that were not deductible for income tax purposes and a partial disallowance of the domestic production activities deduction in fiscal due to the separation 
liquidity and capital resources we believe the ability to generate cash is critical to the value of the company 
in this section  we tell you about our ability to generate and access cash to meet our business needs 
first  we will describe our actual results in generating and utilizing cash by comparing the last three years 
we will also talk about any significant trends we are seeing to help you understand how this could impact us going forward 
second  we will tell you about how we see operating  investing  and financing cash flows being impacted for the next months 
while it s not a certainty  we will tell you where we think cash will come from and how we intend to use it 
we will also talk about significant risks or possible changes to our thinking that could change our expectations 
third  we will tell you about other significant matters that could affect our liquidity on an ongoing basis 
a summary of our cash flows for the last three years is as follows fiscal year ended september  amounts in millions cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase in cash and cash equivalents also includes net cash and cash equivalents provided to our parent company prior to separation on march  
table of contents operating activities our operating cash flow was million lower in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the noteworthy changes in its components were as follows we incurred million in business acquisition related costs in fiscal  substantially all of which were paid by the end of the period 
these costs reduced both our profitability and our operating cash flow in fiscal cash payments for income taxes increased million from fiscal year this change was primarily related to a significant change in the cash current and non cash deferred components of our income tax expense 
with the acquisition of k tron  a higher portion of our tax expense was current meaning higher cash payments offset by non cash deferred income tax benefits 
we paid million less in defined benefit plan contributions in fiscal year as compared to the prior year primarily resulting from lower discretionary payments made in the current year as compared to the fiscal we made cash payments of million to fund a rabbi trust associated with our deferred compensation program in fiscal k tron s core pre tax operating cash flows contributed approximately million to our consolidated operating cash flows for the last months of fiscal in july  we received from forethought our first million interest payment on the forethought note 
our operating cash flow was million higher in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the noteworthy changes in its components were as follows we incurred million more in separation costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  substantially all of which were paid by the end of the period 
this reduced both our profitability and our operating cash flow in fiscal cash payments for income tax payments decreased million from fiscal year  including amounts paid to or received from hill rom to settle our pre separation income tax obligations 
this change was the result of the timing between when we had made these payments to hill rom prior to separation and the timing of when we now make them directly to tax authorities as a separate company 
we paid million more in defined benefit plan contributions in fiscal year as compared to fiscal resulting from a discretionary payment of million made this year 
we made this payment in order to improve the funding level of our plans 
investing activities the significant increase in our net investing activities in fiscal over fiscal was driven by a million net cash payout to acquire k tron and higher capital project spending of million  all of which was offset by the million liquidation of a portion of our ars and investments 
our net investing activities in fiscal year were essentially flat from fiscal the modest change was due to cash invested in and returned from investment assets we received in connection with the separation 
financing activities net cash receipts from financing activities for fiscal increased million  primarily related to million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to fund the acquisition of k tron  and million of proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes the notes 
the proceeds from the notes were subsequently used to pay down million owed on our revolving credit facility and the remaining amount was used to fund working capital needs 

table of contents on july   our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the amount of repurchase activity will depend on a variety of factors including the level of cash generated from operations  the market price of our stock  repayments we elect to make on the credit facility  and the use of cash from operations in support of other business growth opportunities 
during fiscal year  we elected to purchase million shares of our common stock for million 
in fiscal year  we purchased an additional million shares for million 
there were no purchases of stock in fiscal month outlook at the present time  we expect the future profitability of batesville  k tron and the cost structure of our corporate operations to drive our net operating cash flow 
the specifics that follow are known factors that can introduce volatility to that general premise over the next twelve months 
operating activities we made a million discretionary contribution to one of our pension plans in june although we are not required to do so  we may decide to make a contribution to our defined retirement plan in any amount will be based on the performance of the assets within the plan  business developments  and overall economic activity 
we expect the maximum amount of any contribution to be million 
we will continue to monitor plan funding levels in order to optimize our capital deployment and determine the final discretionary amount during fiscal any contributions we make will reduce our net cash flow from operations 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  in july  we issued million in principal amount fixed rate senior unsecured notes  due july these notes will require annual interest payments of approximately million which will reduce our operating cash flow 
investing activities in addition to our traditional level of capital expenditures  we are now including the annual sustaining capital expenditures of k tron 
over the past three calendar years  those expenditures have been between million to million annually 
we can be called upon by our private equity limited partnership investments to provide additional investment funds  the maximum amount being million in the aggregate 
we expect to continue moving forward with our acquisition strategy in order to increase our growth rate for revenues and earnings 
however  any additional acquisitions will depend on whether suitable opportunities are available 
we expect to fund future acquisitions primarily with cash on hand and cash flows from operations 
financing activities we currently expect that comparable quarterly cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future and will require approximately million each quarter based on our outstanding common stock at september  we may use additional cash generated by the business to pay down our revolving credit facility  depending on our working capital needs or as discussed under investing activities  we may utilize availability under the revolving credit facility to finance acquisitions 
we may also resume purchasing additional shares of our common stock  depending on market conditions 
summary of month outlook we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  and financing obligations 

table of contents other liquidity matters at september   we held million in a portfolio of ars consisting of highly rated tax exempt state and municipal securities  the majority of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program recorded at fair value 
we have estimated the current fair value of the portfolio based upon observed pricing on similar assets as of september  although the underlying securities in the portfolio consist of creditworthy borrowers with aaa or a debt ratings  market conditions and auction failures have adversely impacted the liquidity of these securities 
if current market conditions do not improve  or worsen  we may not be able to readily convert these securities to cash  and our earnings could suffer as a result 
although we are not dependent on any cash flows from the forethought note to fund our operating activities  we regularly evaluate the forethought note for impairment based upon collectability 
if  based upon these evaluations  it is probable that the forethought note will not be paid in accordance with its terms  it will be deemed impaired 
based upon information available to us regarding conditions existing on or prior to september   the forethought note is not impaired 
we estimate the fair value of the forethought note based upon a comparison to debt securities currently trading in an active market with similar characteristics of yield  duration  and credit risk  adjusted for liquidity considerations 
we estimate that the fair value of the forethought note and related interest receivable has increased from million at september   to million at september  this increase in estimated fair value was caused by the natural decline in the period to maturity closer to the collection date  offset by an increase in the required yield to maturity discount rate observed in the marketplace on comparable debt instruments adjusted for a liquidity premium 
the model used in estimating the fair value of the forethought note primarily utilizes market data and is not intended to imply that some or all of the future payments due under the forethought note will not be collected when due from forethought 
in march  we established a million five year revolving credit facility the facility with a syndicate of banks 
the term of the facility expires in march borrowings under the facility bear interest at variable rates  as defined therein 
the availability of borrowings under the facility is subject to our ability at the time of borrowing to meet certain specified conditions 
these conditions include compliance with covenants contained in the credit agreement governing the facility  absence of default under the facility  and continued accuracy of certain representations and warranties contained in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit agreement of not more than and a ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of not less than the proceeds of the facility may be used i for working capital and other lawful corporate purposes and ii to finance acquisitions 
as of september   we i had million outstanding  undrawn letters of credit under the facility  ii were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement  and iii had complete access to the remaining million of borrowing capacity available under the facility 
in addition to the amounts above  we had million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees to other financial institutions as of september  a portion of these arrangements is secured by our operating facility in switzerland and million of restricted cash at september  the covenants under the distribution agreement with hill rom effectively prevent us from incurring any additional debt to finance an acquisition based upon our financial position as of september  however  we may utilize existing cash on hand and cash generated from future operations to fund future acquisitions 
our capacity to borrow for acquisitions may increase as cash on hand and our earnings as defined under the distribution agreement increase over time 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments in this section we will tell you about the things we have committed to pay 
this will help give you an understanding of the significance of cash outlays that are fixed beyond the normal accounts payable we have already incurred and have on our books  unless we took some action to delay or cancel the need to pay 
to provide visibility to matters potentially impacting our liquidity position  the following table outlines our contractual obligations as of september  contractual obligations payment due by period less than after amounts in millions total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations defined benefit plan funding other long term liabilities capital call arrangements revolving credit facility year  fixed rate senior unsecured notes total contractual obligations purchase obligations represent contractual obligations under various take or pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business 
these commitments represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing 
also included are obligations related to purchase orders for which we have firm commitments related to order releases under the purchase orders 
the amounts do not include obligations related to other purchase obligations that are not considered take or pay arrangements or subject to firm commitments 
such purchase obligations are primarily reflected in purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations  which we do not believe represent firm purchase commitments 
we expect to fund these commitments with operating cash flows 
the defined benefit plan funding represents payments to comply with non discretionary requirements based upon plan funding at september   and excludes any discretionary contribution 
in the event we choose to make a discretionary contribution  we expect the maximum amount to be million 
the estimated discretionary contribution amount is highly volatile  depending on fiscal asset performance  business developments  and overall economic activity 
other long term liabilities include the forecasted liquidation of liabilities related to our casket pricing obligation  self insurance reserves  and long term severance payments 
we could be called upon by our private equity limited partnership investments to provide additional investment funds  the maximum amount being million in aggregate 
our revolving credit facility expires in march although we may make earlier principal payments at our discretion  we have reflected the principal balance due at expiration in the table above  because that is when we are required to repay 
during july  we issued million of year  fixed rate senior unsecured notes  a portion of which we used to pay down outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facility 
beginning january  we will be required to make semi annual interest payments on our debt  with the principal balance becoming due in july in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  we also have a variety of other agreements related to the procurement of materials and services and other commitments 
we are not subject to any contracts that obligate us to material non cancelable commitments 
while many of these agreements are long term supply agreements  some of which are exclusive supply or complete requirements based contracts  we are not committed under these agreements to accept or pay for requirements which are not needed to meet near term production requirements 

table of contents in connection with past acquisition activities  we have entered into certain guarantees and indemnifications of performance with respect to the fulfillment of our commitments under the respective purchase agreements 
the arrangements generally indemnify the seller for damages associated with breach of contract  inaccuracies in representations and warranties surviving the closing date  and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments retained under the applicable contract 
those representations and warranties which survive closing generally survive for periods up to the maximum period allowed by the applicable statutes of limitations 
guarantees and indemnifications with respect to acquisition activities  if triggered  would not have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates in this section we tell you about accounting estimates that inherently involve significant judgment on our part 
our accounting policies require management to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
if future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
a detailed description of our accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
revenue recognition revenue for our products is most often recognized upon delivery of the products to the customer  but in no case prior to when the risk of loss and other risks and rewards of ownership are transferred 
net revenues reflect gross revenues less sales discounts  customer rebates  sales incentives  and product returns  all of which require us to make estimates for the portion of these allowances that have yet to be credited or paid to our customers 
we estimate these allowances based both upon historical rates and projections of customer purchases toward contractual rebate thresholds 
some of our revenues associated with k tron involve multiple elements ie various components to an overall larger order being manufactured for the customer 
periodically these elements are transferred to the customer at different times pursuant to the customer s requirements 
in these circumstances we may estimate the sales value of the individual elements in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize on the transferred elements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the accounting for our trade receivables requires us to estimate the net realizable value of these assets 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses and collection risk in our existing trade accounts receivable portfolio 
performing our evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to exercise significant judgment based on historical write off and individual customer collection experience 
as a result  our historical experience and current trends we are using in our estimates at any point in time may not be indicative of the collectability of these balances in the future 
auction rate securities the accounting for our auction rate securities requires us to estimate the fair value of these assets in a current environment where there is not an active market to easily establish that value 
prior to july   we utilized a valuation model based upon a discounted cash flow approach 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates of  based on available data  interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit spread related yield and illiquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to value the ars based upon secondary market pricing on observed transactions 
we moved to this approach as we believe the pricing now occurring in the secondary market represents the highest and best use valuation of the ars 
the risk exists that the volatile nature of secondary market pricing may not be reflective of actual realizable value in the future 

table of contents note receivable from forethought we evaluate the note receivable from forethought for impairment based upon collectability 
if  based upon this evaluation  it is probable that the note will not be paid in accordance with its terms  the note will be deemed impaired 
performing an impairment evaluation of the note requires us to exercise significant judgments as to whether forethought has the financial wherewithal to make the scheduled payments based upon events or conditions that we are aware of existing on or prior to the balance sheet date 
the note agreement provides us access to various kinds of financial information from forethought including available capital and surplus within forethought s primary insurance operations  an indicator of liquidity of the entity  embedded value  an indicator of enterprise value and an indicator of the ability of the entity to raise capital  forethought s recent investment portfolio results and the quality of the related investments  gaap equity  an indicator of financial strength  and recent gaap and statutory financial results income  loss and related cash flow effects 
we utilize this information to assess the financial strength of forethought and our prospects for getting paid 
the principal under the note is not scheduled to be repaid until as a result  the indicators or trends we consider at any point in time when making an impairment assessment may not be indicative of forethought s ultimate financial strength at the time of scheduled payment 
if we determine an impairment exists  an impairment reserve would be established based upon the then carrying value of the note and the estimated discounted cash flows we would expect to receive on an impaired basis 
making such an estimate would require us to exercise significant judgment about the expected timing and size of the payments under the note in what could be distressed financial conditions at forethought 
even though we might be legally entitled  we would likely cease recording interest income under the note  due to the uncertainty of being paid under these types of conditions 
liabilities for loss contingencies related to claims and lawsuits the ultimate outcome of claims and lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty 
an estimated loss from these contingencies is recognized when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
making such an estimate requires us to exercise significant judgment 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation 
the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
for a more complete description of loss contingencies related to lawsuits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
legal fees associated with claims and lawsuits are generally expensed as incurred 
upon recognition of an estimated loss resulting from a settlement  an estimate of legal fees to complete the settlement is also included in the amount of the loss recognized 
we are also involved in other possible claims  including product and general liability  workers compensation  auto liability and employment related matters 
outside insurance companies and third party claims administrators establish individual claim reserves and an independent outside actuary provides estimates of ultimate projected losses  including incurred but not reported claims  which are used to establish reserves for losses 
as our actuaries periodically provide us updated ultimate loss projections  we must true up increasing or reducing previously recorded claim reserves 
thus  any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the effect of the true up 
the recorded amounts represent our best estimate of the costs we will incur in relation to such exposures  but it is possible that actual costs could differ from those estimates 

table of contents performance stock based compensation the vesting of our performance based restricted stock and units collectively pbus is contingent upon the creation of shareholder value as measured by the cumulative cash returns and final period income in excess of our weighted average cost of capital over a three year period and a corresponding service requirement 
the value of an award is based upon the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
based on the extent to which the performance criteria are achieved  it is possible for none of the awards to vest or for a range up to the maximum to vest  which is reflected in the pbu table in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
we record expense associated with the awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period based upon an estimate of projected performance 
the actual performance of the company is evaluated quarterly  and the expense is adjusted according to the new projection if it has changed significantly 
as a result  depending on the degree to which we achieve the performance criteria or our projection changes  our expenses related to the pbus may become more volatile as we approach the final performance measurement date at the end of the three years 
this increase in volatility is due to the fact that we must true up increasing or reducing previously recorded compensation expense as the projection of performance changes 
thus any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the cumulative effect of the true up 
preparing the projection of performance requires us to exercise significant judgments as to the expected outcome of final performance up to three years in the future 
in making the projection  we consider both actual results and probable business plans for the future 
at september   we have recorded cumulative compensation expense associated with unvested pbus of million  which continues to be subject to periodic true ups as the related pbus approach the final performance measurement date 
retirement and postretirement plans we sponsor retirement and postretirement benefit plans covering a majority of our employees 
expense recognized in relation to such plans is based upon actuarial valuations 
inherent in those valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected returns on assets  and projected future salary rates 
the discount rates used in the valuation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are evaluated annually based on current market conditions 
in setting the discount rate  we use a yield curve approach to discount each expected cash flow of the liability stream at an interest rate applicable to the timing of each cash flow based on corporate bond rates 
these present values are then converted into an equivalent weighted average discount rate 
our overall expected long term rate of return on pension assets is based on historical and expected future returns  which are inflation adjusted and weighted for the expected return for each component of the investment portfolio 
our rate of assumed compensation increase for pension benefits is also based on our specific historical trends of past wage adjustments in recent years and expectations for the future 
changes in retirement and postretirement benefit expense and the recognized obligations may occur in the future as a result of a number of factors  including changes to any of these assumptions 
our weighted average expected rate of return on pension assets is   and at the end of fiscal  and respectively 
a basis point increase in the expected rate of return on domestic pension assets of million reduces annual pension expense by approximately million 
the weighted average discount rate decreased to and at the end of fiscal for the pension and postretirement healthcare plan expense  respectively 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate increases the annual domestic pension expense by approximately million 
the impact of this decrease to our postretirement healthcare plan expense would be less than million 
impacts from assumption changes could be positive or negative depending on the direction of the change in rates 
based upon the new rates and assumptions  we expect the aggregate expense associated with our defined benefit plans to decrease from million in fiscal to million in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  for key assumptions and other information regarding our retirement and postretirement benefit plans 
uncertain income tax positions on october   we adopted the accounting standard that prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in assessing the need for reserves for uncertain tax positions  we have to make judgments regarding the technical merit of a tax position  and when necessary  an estimate of the settlement amount based upon what we think is the probability of the outcome 
at september   we had reserves of million established for uncertain tax positions based upon our estimates 
our ability to make and update these estimates is limited to the information we have at any given point in time 
this information can include how taxing authorities have treated the position in the past  how similar cases have settled  or where we are in discussions or negotiations with taxing authorities on a particular issue  among others 
as information available to us evolves  we update our reserves quarterly 
these updates can result in volatility to our income tax rate particularly to a given quarter if new information or developments result in a significant change in our estimate 

table of contents business combinations on october   we adopted a new accounting standard that governs how to account for and disclose business combinations eg  when we buy a business 
with a few exceptions  the standard requires that we record the assets and liabilities of the acquired business at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
estimating fair value for acquired assets and liabilities as part of a business combination typically requires us to exercise judgment  particularly for those assets and liabilities that may be unique or not easily determined by reference to market data 
often estimates for these types of acquired assets and liabilities will be developed using valuation models that require both historical and forecasted inputs  as well as market participant expectations 
thus the valuation is directly affected by the inputs we judge as best under the given circumstances 
when material  we expect to seek assistance of competent valuation professionals when the underlying valuation is more complex or unique 
we anticipate that in most cases  we will exercise significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets customer lists or relationships  trademarks  etc  for example  contingent liabilities loss reserves  for example  and contingent consideration earn outs  for example 
this list is not exhaustive  but is designed to give you a better understanding of where we think a larger degree of judgment will be required due to the nature of the item and the way it is typically valued 
depreciable and amortizable lives of long lived assets the recording of depreciation and amortization expense requires management to exercise significant judgment in estimating the economic useful lives of long lived assets  particularly intangible assets 
with the acquisition of k tron  the amortization associated with these estimates is much more significant to our financial statements than in the past 
management s assumptions regarding the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life management s experience with similar assets  changes in technology  utilization  wear and tear  estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  and changes in market demand 
as our assessment is performed on a periodic basis  changes in any management assumptions may result in a shorter or longer estimated useful life for an asset than originally anticipated 
in such a case  we would depreciate or amortize the remaining net book value of the asset over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing or decreasing depreciation or amortization expense per year on a prospective basis 
as a result  our estimates at any point in time may not be indicative of future circumstances 
asset impairment determinations accounting standards require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually or when circumstances would suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
testing of either goodwill or indefinite lived assets requires that we estimate the fair value of the asset in question 
estimating fair value for these assets typically requires us to exercise significant judgment  particularly for asset values that are not easily determined by reference to market data 
often estimates for these types of assets are developed using valuation models that require both historical and forecasted inputs  as well as market participant expectations 
thus the valuation is directly affected by the inputs we judge as best under the given circumstances 
in analyzing the future cash flows of various assets  critical assumptions we make may include some of the following the intended use of assets and the expected cash flows resulting directly from such use  industry specific economic conditions  customer preferences and behavior patterns  and the impact of applicable regulatory initiatives  if any 

table of contents our assumptions are sometimes subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we make are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge which could materially impact our reported financial results by decreasing operating income and lowering asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 
when material  we expect to seek assistance of competent valuation professionals when the underlying valuation is more complex or unique 
tangible and other intangible assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization are also evaluated when circumstances would suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
testing of these assets require that we estimate future cash flows associated with the asset s in question

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this section  we tell you about market risks we think could have a significant impact on our bottom line or the financial strength of our company 
market risks here generally mean how results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities could be affected by market factors such as interest rates  currency exchange rates  the value of commodities  and debt and equity price risks 
if those factors change significantly  it could help or hurt our bottom line  depending on how we react to them 
we are exposed to various market risks 
we have established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
our primary exposures are to collection risk customer receivables and our forethought note  fluctuations in market prices for certain purchases of commodities  variability in exchange rates in foreign locations  and volatility in the fair value of our investments 
we also have some interest rate exposure 
what follows are the specifics 
we have an outstanding note receivable the forethought note and related interest receivable from forethought with an aggregate carrying value of million as of september  the primary risk with the forethought note is collection 
should forethought underperform to an extent that it cannot meet its financial obligations  our earnings could be negatively impacted  resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we currently do not expect this to be the case 
we estimate the fair value of the note receivable from forethought based upon comparison to debt securities currently trading in an active market with similar characteristics of yield  duration  and credit risk adjusted for liquidity considerations 
based upon market data available to us  we estimate that the fair value of the note and accrued interest is approximately million  based upon an estimated yield to maturity of approximately as of september  this is approximately million below its carrying value at september  an increase or decrease of in the discount rate utilized to estimate the fair value of the note including interest receivable would indicate a change in fair value of approximately million 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  wood  red metals  and fuel 
while these materials are typically available from multiple suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to market price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchasing process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from our larger suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or if our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain supply chain efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 

table of contents we have a portfolio of ars with an estimated fair value of million as of september  
the primary risk here is the lack of a liquid market to sell these investments 
if current market conditions do not improve  we may not be able to readily convert the ars to cash  exposing us to a longer term risk of impairment  and our earnings could be adversely affected 
we are subject to volatility in our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio includes private equity limited partnerships lps and common stock with an aggregate carrying value of million at september  these investments could be adversely affected by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates  default on debt instruments  and other factors  resulting in an adverse impact 
the changes in the fair value of the lps underlying investment portfolios can impact us significantly because we record our share of the change in our income statement under the equity method of accounting 
our pension plans assets are also subject to volatility that can be caused by fluctuation in general economic conditions 
plan assets are invested by the plans fiduciaries  which direct investments according to specific policies 
those policies subject investments to the following restrictions in our domestic plan short term securities must be rated a p or higher  fixed income securities must have a quality credit rating of bbb or higher  and investments in equities in any one company may not exceed of the equity portfolio 
our income statement is currently shielded from volatility in plan assets due to the way accounting standards are applied for pension plans  although favorable or unfavorable investment performance over the long term will impact our pension expense if it deviates from our assumption related to future rate of return 
with the addition of k tron  our exposure to exchange rates are primarily i the us dollar versus each of the swiss franc  the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  and the swedish krona and ii the swiss franc versus the euro and the british pound sterling 
from time to time we may enter into currency exchange agreements to manage our exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates related to specific transactions  primarily forecasted intercompany purchasing 
foreign cash balances in currencies other than the swiss franc are limited in order to manage the transaction exposure caused by the marking to market of non swiss franc balances to swiss franc values on the balance sheet of our swiss operations 
as of september   a change in the foreign exchange rates affecting balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a change in pre tax earnings of approximately million 
this hypothetical change on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the september   actual foreign exchange rates and hypothetical rates assuming a change in foreign exchange rates on that date 
we expect to expand our hedging program in fiscal to help reduce earnings volatility that could occur associated with the non swiss franc balances of our swiss operations 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments cta within accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
using the example above  the hypothetical change in cta would be calculated by multiplying the net assets of our non us operations by a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates 
the result of this calculation would be to change shareholders equity by approximately million as of september  at september   we had million outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our revolving credit facility which bears a variable rate of interest that is based upon the lender s base rate or the libor rate 
the interest we pay on our borrowings is dependent on interest rate conditions and the timing of our financing needs 
assuming our borrowings were to remain at million for months  a move in the related interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately million
