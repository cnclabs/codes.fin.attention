item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments  we have entered into two separate contracts with thales alenia space to construct low earth orbit satellites for our second generation satellite constellation and to provide launch related and operations support services  and to construct the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units and in orbit test equipment for our second generation satellite constellation 
a substantial majority of the payments under the thales alenia space agreements  are denominated in euros 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has decreased as a result of certain portions of our contracts for the construction of our second generation constellation satellite and the related control network facility  which are payable primarily in euros  are at a fixed exchange rate 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar  on the remaining balance not at a fixed exchange rate of approximately million on december   would result in million of additional payments 
see note property and equipment of the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
our interest rate risk arises from our variable rate debt under our facility agreement  under which loans bear interest at a floating rate based on the libor 
in order to minimize the interest rate risk  we completed an arrangement with the lenders under the facility agreement to limit the interest to which we are exposed 
the interest rate cap provides limits on the month libor rate base rate used to calculate the coupon interest on outstanding amounts on the facility agreement of from the date of issuance through december thereafter  the base rate is capped at should the base rate not exceed 
should the base rate exceed  our base rate will be less than the then month libor rate 
the applicable margin from the base rate ranges from to through the termination date of the facility 
assuming that we borrowed the entire million under the facility agreement  a change in interest rates would result in a change to interest expense of approximately million annually
