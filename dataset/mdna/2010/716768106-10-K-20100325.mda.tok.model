our actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled competition  distribution and government regulation included in item part i and risk factors included in item part a of this annual report on form k 
overview based on our net sales of billion  we are north america s leading specialty provider of products  services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets 
as of january   we operated  stores  and we anticipate opening to net new stores in our stores carry a broad and deep selection of high quality pet supplies at everyday low prices 
we offer approximately  distinct items  including nationally recognized brand names  as well as an extensive selection of private label brands across a range of product categories 
we complement our extensive product assortment with a wide selection of value added pet services  including grooming  training  boarding and day camp 
all our stores offer complete pet training services  and virtually all our stores feature pet styling salons that provide high quality grooming services 
our petshotels provide boarding for dogs and cats  which includes hour supervision  an on call veterinarian  temperature controlled rooms and suites  daily specialty treats and play time  as well as day camp for dogs 
as of january   we operated petshotels  and we anticipate opening approximately petshotels in we make full service veterinary care available through our strategic relationship with certain third party operators 
as of january   full service veterinary hospitals were in of our stores 
banfield operated of the veterinary hospitals 
the remaining hospitals are operated by other third parties in canada 
the principal challenges we face as a business are the highly competitive market in which we operate and the recent changes in the macroeconomy 
however  we believe we have a competitive advantage in our solutions for the total lifetime care sm of pets  including pet services and proprietary brands  that we believe cannot easily be duplicated 
additionally  we have been able to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to meet our financing needs and continue to have access to our credit facility 
we expect to continuously assess the economic environment and market conditions to guide our decisions regarding our uses of cash  including capital expenditures  investments  dividends and share repurchases

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  insurance liabilities and reserves  asset impairments  reserve for closed stores  reserves against deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items at least once every quarter 
stores generally perform physical inventories at least once a year 
between the physical inventories  stores perform counts on certain inventory items 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their historical cost 
factors included in determining obsolescence reserves include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of merchandise  seasonal trends and decisions to discontinue certain products 
if assumptions about future demand change  or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may require additional reserves 
we have not made any significant changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our inventory valuation reserves during the past three fiscal years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the accounting methodology and assumed factors used to create the estimates we use to calculate our inventory valuation reserves 
as of january   and february   we had inventory valuation reserves of million and million  respectively 
additionally  we believe that a change in our inventory valuation reserves would not be material to our consolidated financial statements 
asset impairments we review long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of such assets may not be recoverable 

table of contents we have not made any significant changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
there were no material asset impairments identified during  or reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
as of january   and february   our reserve for closed stores was million and million  respectively 
we can make no assurances that additional charges for these stores will not be required based on the changing real estate environment 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to determine our reserve for closed stores  including cash flow projections and sublease assumptions 
in any event  a change in our reserve for closed stores would not be material to our consolidated financial statements 
insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain property and casualty insurance on all our properties and leasehold interests  product liability insurance that covers products and the sale of pets  self insured health plans and workers compensation and employers liability insurance 
under our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies as of january   we maintain a self insured retention of million per occurrence for general liability and a combination of self insurance and a high deductible workers compensation plan that specifies retention of million per occurrence for workers compensation 
we establish reserves for losses based on periodic actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment to the reserves 
as of january   and february   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to casualty  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability  and workers compensation insurance policies 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our insurance reserves during the past three years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our insurance reserves  including factors such as historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other valuations 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our insurance reserves would have affected net income by approximately million in income taxes we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at january   and february   were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given fiscal period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and could result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period 
table of contents of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material

table of contents overall merchandise margin decreased basis points 
merchandise product margin decreased basis points  with mix representing and rate representing of the decline 
the mix shift is due to an increase in consumables merchandise sales mix relative to net sales 
the rate impact is due to select price reductions  an increase in promotions for hardgoods merchandise  and broad category promotions to drive additional customer traffic 
difficult macroeconomic conditions  including reduced discretionary consumer spending  challenged our merchandise product margins as we have experienced a mix shift from higher margin discretionary hardgoods into consumables 
consumables merchandise sales  which includes pet food  treats  and litter  typically generate lower gross margins as compared to hardgoods merchandise 
hardgoods merchandise includes pet supplies such as collars  leashes  health care supplies  grooming and beauty aids  toys  and apparel  as well as pet beds and carriers 
merchandise margins related to the flow through of previously capitalized inbound freight  as well as certain procurement and distribution costs  decreased basis points 
services margin increased basis points primarily due to the demand for our grooming services  and the addition of new petshotels since services sales typically generate lower gross margins than merchandise sales as service related labor is included in cost of sales  however  services generate higher operating margins than merchandise sales 
as discussed above  the shift in merchandise sales to consumables merchandise has contributed to the overall decrease in margin 
store occupancy costs included in margin increased basis points primarily due to the addition of new stores  and new store growth outpacing the rate of sales growth 
supply chain costs decreased basis points due to lower fuel costs  transportation efficiencies and improved productivity in our distribution centers 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for and  respectively  representing an improvement of basis points 
the primary reasons for the decrease in operating  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales during were increased efficiencies in our advertising spending due to lower advertising rates  and lower store preopening expenses due to slower store growth 
store labor expense  travel  and supplies costs were also lower due to vendor renegotiations and various cost control initiatives 
interest expense  net interest expense  which is primarily related to capital lease obligations  increased to million for  compared to million for included in interest expense  net was interest income of million for both and income tax expense in  the million income tax expense represents an effective tax rate of  compared with income tax expense of million  which represented an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to tax exempt gains from invested assets to fund our deferred compensation plan 
the effective tax rate is calculated by dividing our income tax expense  which includes the income tax expense related to our equity in income from investee  by income before income tax expense and equity in income from investee 
equity in income from investee our equity in income from our investment in banfield was million and million for and  respectively  based on our ownership percentage in banfield s net income

gross profit gross profit decreased to of net sales for from for  representing a decrease of basis points 
in  store occupancy costs increased basis points primarily due to the growth in new stores 
we opened net new stores and petshotels 
the increase in store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales is due to the addition of new stores in more expensive regions  as well as higher real property taxes and lower reimbursements from banfield for vet clinic expenses 
supply chain costs were flat as a percentage of net sales 
we realized cost savings from increased productivity and efficiency across the distribution network due to our new replacement distribution centers in newnan  georgia and reno  nevada  offset by pressure from higher fuel prices during compared to services sales were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales 
we also opened petshotels in compared to in petshotels have higher costs as a percentage of net sales in the first several years 
merchandise margin decreased basis points  with mix representing and rate representing of the decline 
the mix shift is due to an increase of consumables merchandise sales relative to total net sales 
consumables merchandise sales typically generate a lower gross margin compared to hardgoods merchandise 
macroeconomic conditions  including a decrease in consumer spending  challenged our merchandise margins 
as a result  we have experienced softness in our higher margin hardgoods merchandise sales 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for from for  representing a basis point improvement 
the decrease in operating  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was attributable to various cost savings initiatives  including a new store labor management process  combined with reduced professional fees  renegotiated maintenance and supply contracts  and lower insurance related costs 
these expense decreases were partially offset by higher payroll and benefit costs for additional headcount at our corporate headquarters  and higher stock based compensation expense 

table of contents interest expense  net interest expense  which is primarily related to capital leases  increased to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to continued increases in capital lease obligations

cash available for short term investments was lower during compared to primarily due to cash used to partially fund our accelerated share repurchase  or asr  agreement  in august  payments on the revolving line of credit  and the purchase of million shares of our common stock for million during during  our investments were limited to short term  highly liquid  money market funds 
income tax expense in  the million income tax expense represents an effective tax rate of  compared with income tax expense of million  which represented an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for includes a benefit from the use of capital loss carryforwards to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of banfield non voting shares and benefits from the release of uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and from the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions 
the effective tax rate is calculated by dividing our income tax expense  which includes the income tax expense related to our equity in income from investee  by income before income tax expense and equity in income from investee 
equity in income from investee our equity in income from our investment in banfield was million and million for and  respectively  based on our ownership percentage in banfield s net income 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow despite recent volatility and disruption in the global and capital credit markets  we have continued to have full access to our credit facility and to generate operating cash flow sufficient to meet our financing needs 
we believe that our operating cash flow and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we also have access to our million five year revolving credit facility  although there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms 
we expect to continuously assess the economic environment and market conditions to guide our decisions regarding our uses of cash  including capital expenditures  investments  dividends and the purchase of treasury stock 
we finance our operations  new store and petshotel growth  store remodels and other expenditures to support our growth initiatives primarily through cash generated by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  million for and million for receipts from our sales come from cash  checks and third party debit and credit cards  and therefore provide a significant source of liquidity 
cash is used in operating activities primarily to fund procurement of merchandise inventories and other assets  net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
the primary differences between and were lower levels of merchandise inventories and prepaid assets and an increase in other current liabilities  offset by an increase in deferred income taxes

the primary differences between and were increased purchases of treasury stock and no short term debt borrowings 
the primary differences between and were lower purchases of treasury stock in  lower proceeds from common stock issued under stock incentive plans  and lower tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized 
free cash flow free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules 
management believes  however  that free cash flow is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance  which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
although other companies report their free cash flow  numerous methods may exist for calculating free cash flow 
as a result  the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow 
we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other company 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for property and equipment  and payments of capital lease obligations 
we generated free cash flow of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in our free cash flow is primarily due to a decrease in capital spending as a result of the slowdown in store openings

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements substantially all our stores are leased facilities 
we opened new stores and closed stores in generally  each new store requires capital expenditures of approximately million for fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements  approximately million for inventory and approximately million for preopening costs 
we expect total capital spending to be approximately to million for  based on our plan to open to net new stores and new petshotels  continuing our investment in the development of our information systems  adding to our services capacity with the expansion of certain grooming salons  remodeling or replacing certain store assets and continuing our store refresh program 
our ability to fund our operations and make planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control

as of january   million was outstanding under our letters of credit 
related party transactions we have an investment in banfield which  through a wholly owned subsidiary  medical management international  inc  operates full service veterinary hospitals inside of our stores 
our investment consists of common and convertible preferred stock 
in  we sold a portion of our non voting shares in banfield resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in connection with this transaction  we also converted our remaining banfield non voting shares to voting shares 
the increase in voting shares caused us to exceed the significant influence threshold as defined by gaap  which required us to account for our investment in banfield using the equity method of accounting instead of the previously applied cost method 
as of january   we owned approximately of the voting stock and approximately of the combined voting and non voting stock of banfield 
our equity income from our investment in banfield  which is recorded one month in arrears  was million for we charge banfield license fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals and for their portion of utilities costs 
we treat these amounts as a reduction of the retail stores occupancy costs  which are included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
we also charge banfield for its portion of specific operating expenses  and treat the reimbursement as a reduction of the stores operating expense 
we recognized license fees  utilities and other cost reimbursements of million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
receivables from banfield totaled million and 
table of contents million at january   and february   respectively  and were included in the receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the master operating agreement also includes a provision for the sharing of profits on the sales of therapeutic pet foods sold in all stores with a hospital operated by banfield 
the net sales and gross profits on the sale of therapeutic pet foods is not material 
credit facility we have a million five year revolving credit facility  or revolving credit facility  that expires on august  borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base and bear interest  at our option  at a bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
we are subject to fees payable to lenders each quarter at an annual rate of of the unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also gives us the ability to issue letters of credit  which reduce the amount available under the revolving credit facility 
letter of credit issuances under the revolving credit facility are subject to interest payable to the lenders and bear interest of to for standby letters of credit or to for commercial letters of credit 
as of january   we had no borrowings and million in stand by letter of credit issuances under our revolving credit facility 
as of february   we had no borrowings and million in stand by letter of credit issuances under our revolving credit facility 
we also have a million stand alone letter of credit facility  or stand alone letter of credit facility  that expires august  we are subject to fees payable to the lender each quarter at an annual rate of of the average daily face amount of the letters of credit outstanding during the preceding calendar quarter 
in addition  we are required to maintain a cash deposit with the lender equal to the amount of outstanding letters of credit or we may use other approved investments as collateral 
if we use other approved investments as collateral  we must have an amount on deposit which  when multiplied by the advance rate of  is equal to the amount of the outstanding letters of credit under the stand alone letter of credit facility 
as of january   we had million in outstanding letters of credit under the stand alone letter of credit facility and million in restricted cash on deposit with the lender 
as of february   we had no outstanding letters of credit under the stand alone letter of credit facility  no restricted cash or short term investments on deposit with the lender  and no other investments related to the stand alone letter of credit facility 
we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs 
the revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility permit the payment of dividends  if we are not in default and the payment of dividends would not result in default of the revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility 
as of january   we were in compliance with the terms and covenants of our revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility 
the revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility are secured by substantially all our personal property assets  our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain real property 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profits during the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
controllable expenses could fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a year 
since our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store and petshotel openings and related preopening costs  the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores and petshotels and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate 
finally  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established 
we expense preopening costs associated with each new location as the costs are incurred 

table of contents while we have experienced inflationary pressure in recent years  we have been able to largely mitigate the effect by increasing retail prices accordingly 
although neither inflation nor deflation has had a material impact on net operating results  we can make no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business 
such risk is principally associated with foreign exchange fluctuations  as well as changes in our credit standing 
in addition  a market risk is associated with fuel prices 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk
