item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
see item a risk factors above regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
overview we are a leading provider of information technology it security solutions  including web security including malware detection and removal  data security  and email security solutions 
our solutions are available as software installed on standard server hardware  as software pre installed on optimized appliances  and a software as a service saas offering 
our products and services are sold to enterprises  small and medium sized businesses smbs  and internet service providers through a network of value added resellers and original equipment manufacturer oem arrangements 
our portfolio of url filtering  real time web security  data loss prevention dlp and email anti spam and security software allows organizations to dynamically categorize user generated and other dynamic web content  prevent access to undesirable and dangerous elements on the web  such as web sites that contain inappropriate content or sites that download viruses  spyware  keyloggers and an ever increasing variety of malicious code  including web sites with user generated content  identify and remove malicious applications from incoming web traffic  prevent the unauthorized use and loss of sensitive data  such as customer or employee information  filter spam out of incoming email traffic  filter viruses and other malicious attachments from email and instant messages  manage the use of non web internet traffic  such as peer to peer communications and instant messaging  protect from spam and malware embedded in web based user generated content  and control misuse of an organization s valuable computing resources  including unauthorized downloading of high bandwidth content 
since we commenced operations in  websense has evolved from a reseller of computer security products to a leading provider of it security software solutions  including web security  url filtering  dlp  email  anti spam and messaging security solutions 
our first web filtering software product was released in and prevented access to inappropriate web content 
since then  we have focused on adapting our web filtering and content classification capabilities to address changing internet use patterns and the growing incidence of web based criminal activity  as well as integrating web security with email security and data security solutions 
during  we derived of our revenue from international sales  compared with for  with the united kingdom comprising approximately and approximately of our total revenue in and  respectively 
we believe international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european  asia pacific and latin american markets 
we utilize a two tier distribution strategy in north america to sell our products  with an objective of increasing the number of value added resellers selling our products and further extending our reach into the smb market segment 
our distribution strategy outside north america also relies on a multi tiered system of distributors and value added resellers 
sales through indirect channels currently account for more than of our revenue 
sales to ingram micro  our broad line distributor who sells our products in north america through approximately  resellers  accounted for approximately of our revenue in and of our revenue 
table of contents in we also have several arrangements with oems that grant the oem customers the right to incorporate our products into the oem s products for resale to end users 
we sell subscriptions to our products  generally in  or month contract durations  based on the number of seats or devices managed 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our products  including our appliances and our add on modules  on a daily straight line basis commencing on the day the term of the subscription begins  over the term of the subscription agreement 
we recognize revenue associated with oem contracts ratably over the contractual period for which we are obligated to provide our services 
we generally recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include sales commissions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription contract and are fully expensed in the period the product and or key is delivered 
our operating expenses in decreased as compared to primarily due to a reduction in the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the elimination of the majority of the restructuring and integration costs related to the surfcontrol acquisition and the favorable movement of currency exchange rates 
these cost reductions were only partially offset in by our expanded selling and marketing efforts  continued product research and development and investments in administrative infrastructure to support subscription sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
in october  we closed our acquisition of surfcontrol and as a result incurred an operating loss under gaap during the fourth quarter of and for the fiscal years and similar to websense  surfcontrol sold products primarily under subscriptions whereby revenues were recorded ratably over the term of the agreement 
under purchase accounting  we wrote off million of the deferred revenue of surfcontrol  leaving a balance of million 
this adjustment reflected the fair value of the post contract technical support services that is recognized daily in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
in connection with the acquisition  we incurred restructuring costs primarily in connection with reducing surfcontrol headcount and eliminating redundant facilities 
as of the acquisition date  we also immediately started to incur the expenses of operating the surfcontrol operations as well as recording the amortization of the acquired intangibles 
given our deferred revenue as of december   our subscriptions up for renewal in for which we will recognize a portion of the total billing as revenue and the elimination of many of the non recurring acquisition related expenses  we currently expect to report income from operations for fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
when a purchase decision is made for our products  including our appliance products  customers enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of seats or devices 
other services such as upgrades enhancements and standard post contract technical support services are sold together with our product subscription and provided throughout the subscription term 
we recognize revenue on a daily straight line basis  including our appliance product revenue  commencing on the date the term of the subscription begins  and continuing over the term of the subscription agreement  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured 
upon entering into a subscription arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee  we electronically deliver access codes to users  and in the case of our appliance product we ship the product with our software pre installed on the product  and then promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their order 
payment is due for the full term of the subscription  generally within to days of the invoice 
we 
table of contents record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
when we enter into a subscription agreement that is denominated and paid in a currency other than us dollars  we record the subscription billing and deferred revenue in us dollars based upon the currency exchange rate in effect on the last day of the previous month before the subscription agreement is effective 
changes in currency rates relative to the us dollar may have a significant impact on the revenue that we will recognize under contracts that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
for our oem contracts  we grant our oem customers the right to incorporate our products into their products for resale to end users 
the oem customer pays us a royalty fee for each resale to an end user of a subscription to our product over a specified period of time 
we recognize revenue associated with the oem contracts ratably over the contractual period for which we are obligated to provide our services 
the timing of the oem revenue recognition will vary for each oem depending on the information available  such as underlying end user subscription periods  to determine the contractual obligation period 
we record distributor marketing payments and channel rebates as an offset to revenue 
we recognize distributor marketing payments as an offset to revenue as the marketing service is provided 
we recognize channel rebates as an offset to revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription agreement 
acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with us gaap accounting rules for business combinations which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value of intangible assets  including acquired technology and customer relationships  is based on significant judgments made by management 
the valuations and useful life assumptions are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that are considered reasonable by management 
in our assessment of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in the portauthority and surfcontrol acquisitions  management used valuation techniques and made various assumptions 
our analysis and financial projections were based on management s prospective operating plans and the historical performance of the acquired businesses 
we engaged third party valuation firms to assist management in the following developing an understanding of the economic and competitive environment for the industry in which we and the acquired companies participate  identifying the intangible assets acquired  reviewing the acquisition agreements and other relevant documents made available  interviewing our employees  including the employees of the acquired companies  regarding the history and nature of the acquisition  historical and expected financial performance  product lifecycles and roadmap  and other factors deemed relevant to the valuation  performing additional market research and analysis deemed relevant to the valuation analysis  estimating the fair values and recommending useful lives of the acquired intangible assets  and preparing a narrative report detailing methods and assumptions used in the valuation of the intangible assets 
all work performed by the outside valuation firms was discussed and reviewed in detail by management to determine the estimated fair values of the intangible assets 
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
we review goodwill that has an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
we amortize the cost of 
table of contents identified intangible assets using amortization methods that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
we review for impairment by facts or circumstances  either external or internal  indicating that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset 
we measure impairment losses related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed their fair values 
we measure fair value generally based on the estimated future cash flows 
our analysis is based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable 
if necessary  we perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation under the fair value method 
share based compensation expense related to stock options is recorded based on the fair value of the award on its grant date which we estimate using the black scholes valuation model 
share based compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans excluding tax effects 
that total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures as well as for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of approximately years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions described below 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock 
we base the risk free interest rate that is used in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically four years 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 
we determine the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves for tax contingencies are established when we 
table of contents believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with prevailing law and practice 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
during the fourth quarter of  the us internal revenue service the irs issued notices of proposed adjustment related to the cost sharing arrangement between our us parent company and our irish subsidiary  including the amount of the cost sharing buy in  as well as with respect to our claim of research and development tax credits and our income tax deductions for equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the amount of additional tax proposed by the irs totals approximately million  of which million relates to the amount of the cost sharing buy in  million relates to research and development credits and million relates to equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the total additional tax proposed excludes interest  penalties and state income taxes  each of which may be significant  and a potential reduction in tax on the irish subsidiary 
the proposed adjustments also do not include the future impact that changes in our cost sharing arrangement could have on our effective tax rate 
as each audit progresses and is ultimately concluded  adjustments  if any  will be recorded in our financial statements from time to time in light of prevailing facts based on our and the taxing authority s respective positions on any disputed matters 
we believe the irs s positions with respect to the proposed adjustments to our cost sharing arrangements  including the amount of cost sharing buy in  our research and development tax credits  and our deductions for equity compensation are inconsistent with applicable tax law  and that we have meritorious defenses to our positions 
accordingly  we are vigorously defending our positions  including as necessary and appropriate  utilizing our rights to appeal as well as other legal remedies 
while we believe the irs s asserted positions on these matters are not supported by applicable law  we may be required to make additional payments in order to resolve these matters 
in particular  the irs has identified and is aggressively pursuing cost sharing arrangements between domestic and international subsidiaries  including the amount of the buy in  as a potential area for audit exposure for many companies 
if this matter is litigated and the position proposed by the irs were sustained  our results of operations for periods when any new liability is incurred would be materially and adversely affected 
we also cannot predict what impact an adverse result could have on our future income tax rate  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and other loss contingencies 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay their invoices 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and other facts and circumstances of our existing customers 
if the 
table of contents financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires significant judgment by management based on the facts and circumstances of each matter 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods shown 
years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense other income  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss income year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was a result primarily of increased revenue from new  renewed and upgraded product subscriptions including saas security products  dlp products and oem contract revenue from to as well as the revenue from our websense web security gateway and v appliance sales that commenced in revenue from products sold in the united states accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or in revenue from products sold internationally accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or in we had current deferred revenue of million as of december   compared to million as of december  we expect our revenue to increase over revenue levels due to the level of current deferred revenue that will be recognized as revenue during  subscriptions that are scheduled for renewal in that are expected to be renewed and expected new business during for which a ratable portion of revenue will be recognized during our revenue in may be impacted by the duration of contracts for renewal and new subscriptions  the timing of sales of renewal and new subscriptions  the average annual contract value and per seat price  and currency exchange rates impacting new and renewal subscriptions in international markets 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of the costs of content review  technical support  infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our databases  costs associated with providing our saas security products  amortization of 
table of contents acquired technology and the amortized costs of acquiring and configuring our v appliance 
cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the million increase primarily consisted of million of increased amortization of acquired technology primarily due to the acquisitions of technology in the latter part of  million related to increased personnel costs  and million related to sales of our appliance products  offset by a reduction in our allocated costs of million 
we allocate the costs for human resources  employee benefits  payroll taxes  information technology  facilities and fixed asset depreciation to each of our functional areas based on headcount data 
our headcount in cost of revenue departments increased from an average of during to an average of during and is expected to remain relatively flat in as of december   the acquired technology is being amortized over a remaining weighted average period of years 
we expect to record million in amortization expense of acquired technology in based on our existing acquired technology assets as of december  our cost of revenues for appliances will increase as a result of the appliances being sold for a full fiscal year and will increase as sales of appliances increase 
in addition  we expect cost of revenue to increase to support the growth and maintenance of our databases and costs associated with providing our saas security services as well as the technical support needs of our customers 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to during from in primarily due to reduced allocated costs as a result of the completion of surfcontrol related integration activities during we expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars in but as a percentage of revenue will remain approximately the same for compared to gross margin gross margin increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to in from in primarily due to the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue described in the preceding cost of revenues section 
we expect that gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  will remain in excess of of revenue for operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits related to personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  including costs related to public relations  advertising  promotions and travel  amortization of acquired customer relationships as well as allocated costs 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to an million reduction in amortization of acquired customer relationships from the acquisition of surfcontrol in october and a million decrease in allocated costs offset by increased personnel costs of million as our headcount in sales and marketing increased from an average of during to an average of during headcount is expected to be relatively flat in as of december   the acquired customer relationships intangible assets are being amortized over a remaining weighted average period of approximately years 
operating expenses in were reduced compared to as a result of strengthening us currency exchange rates relative to the foreign currencies in which certain of our international expenses were incurred 
we expect overall selling and marketing expenses to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in primarily due to a decrease of approximately million of amortization of acquired intangibles from the surfcontrol acquisition 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may also impact our expenses in  and the amount of sales commissions recognized during the year can vary based on the sales volume for our product subscriptions 
we expect amortization of selling and marketing related acquired intangibles of million in based on our existing acquired intangible assets as of december  from the surfcontrol and portauthority acquisitions 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers and allocated costs 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease of million in research and development expenses was primarily due to a reduction in allocated costs of million offset by increased personnel costs of million 

table of contents although our headcount increased in research and development from an average of during to an average of during  the majority of whom were employed in foreign jurisdictions  the impact was significantly offset by the favorable movement in currency exchange rates in compared to and our increased hiring of employees in relatively low cost foreign locations 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in due to our expanded base of product offerings and the full year impact of hiring of personnel to support our existing and new products 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may also impact our expenses in we are managing the increase in our absolute research and development expenses by operating research and development facilities in multiple international locations  including a facility in beijing  china  that have lower costs than our operations in the united states 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance  and administrative personnel  third party professional services fees and allocated costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a reduction in allocated costs of million and a reduction in professional service fees of million primarily related to the completion of surfcontrol related integration activities during although our headcount increased in general and administrative departments from an average of during to an average of during  the impact was offset by the favorable movement in currency exchange rates and the mix of headcount in compared to we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but decline as a percentage of revenue in due to the expected increase in revenue 
interest expense interest expense represents the interest incurred on our senior secured credit facility that we utilized to pay for a portion of the surfcontrol purchase price in october interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to a lower average outstanding loan balance on our senior secured term loan of million during compared to an average loan balance of million during and lower interest rates 
also included in the interest expense is amortization of deferred financing fees of million and million for and  respectively that were capitalized as part of the senior secured credit facility 
we made principal payments on the senior secured credit facility that reduced the outstanding balance from million as of december  to million as of december  as a result of reductions in the libor interest rate and improvements in our leverage ratio  our weighted average interest rate decreased from at december  to as of december  the amount of interest expense will fluctuate due to changes in the outstanding principal balance  changes in libor and changes in our applicable spread to libor based upon improvements in our leverage ratio in accordance with our senior secured credit facility agreement 
we expect interest expense to decline in compared to due to the anticipated lower average outstanding principal amount under the senior secured credit facility  the expected lower marginal interest rate from the reduction in the notional amount of principal subject to the fixed rate swap agreement  and the expiration of the swap agreement on september  fluctuations in libor could impact our marginal interest rate 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of our senior secured credit facility 
other income  net net other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates on our balances of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities during as compared to during  we also used million to make principal payments on our senior secured credit facility and approximately million for stock repurchases  reducing our cash balances 
we expect to continue to generate significant cash flow from our operations and expect to continue to use a substantial portion of cash generated to pay down debt and fund stock repurchases 
due to a lower interest rate environment we expect our net other income in will be consistent with or less than levels 

table of contents provision for income taxes in  we recognized an income tax provision of million compared to an income tax benefit of million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate variance from the statutory rate was primarily related to an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions and an increase in valuation allowance related to net operating losses for one of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  partially offset by income generated in low tax jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate variance from the statutory rate was primarily related to losses generated in a low tax jurisdiction ireland and the establishment of a valuation allowance related to net operating losses for one of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom offset by release of a valuation allowance related to net operating losses in the united states 
our effective tax rate may change in future periods due to the composition of taxable income between domestic and international operations  the magnitude of our tax exempt income  any future acquisitions and any future changes or interpretations in tax rules and legislation  or corresponding accounting rules

table of contents operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in approximately million of the increase was due to the amortization of acquired customer relationships which resulted from the acquisition of surfcontrol in october as of december   the acquired customer relationships intangible assets were amortized over a remaining weighted average period of approximately years 
in addition to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due to increased personnel costs of million  including new personnel added to support increased sales following the surfcontrol acquisition in october  and million of increased allocated costs 
our headcount in sales and marketing increased from an average of during to an average of during operating expenses in were reduced by strengthening us currency exchange rates relative to the foreign currencies in which certain of our international expenses were incurred 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily due to million of increased personnel cost  including adding new employees due to the surfcontrol acquisition in october  and increased hiring to support the release of our web content gateway  dlp endpoint module and enhancements to our other products  as well as to support our expanding list of technology partners and million of increased allocated costs

general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to million of increased personnel costs needed to support our growing operations  including the acquisition of surfcontrol in october  million of increased professional services primarily related to surfcontrol integration activities and million of increased allocated costs 
our headcount increased in general and administrative departments from an average of during to an average of during during  we incurred million in non recurring acquisition related general and administrative expenses  including professional services  integration travel and allocated excess facility expenses 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the senior secured credit facility being outstanding for only one quarter in compared to the full year in also included in the interest expense is amortization of deferred financing fees of million and  for and  respectively that were capitalized as part of the senior secured credit facility 
we made prepayments on the senior secured credit facility that reduced the outstanding balance from million as of december  to million as of december  as a result of reductions in the libor interest rate and improvements in our leverage ratio  our weighted average interest rate decreased from at december  to as of december  other income  net net other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to reduced cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances from which we generate interest income as a result of our use of an aggregate of million to fund the acquisitions of surfcontrol in october and portauthority in january and related transaction costs 
during  we also used million to make prepayments of principal on our senior secured credit facility and approximately million for stock repurchases reducing our cash balances 
the decline in net other income was also due to lower interest rates realized on our balances of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as foreign exchange losses due to unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates during as compared with 
table of contents provision for income taxes in  we recognized an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax expense of million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate variance from the statutory rate was primarily related to losses generated in a low tax jurisdiction ireland and the establishment of a valuation allowance related to net operating losses for one of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom offset by release of a valuation allowance related to net operating losses in the united states 
in the annual effective tax rate variance from the statutory rate was primarily attributed to certain post acquisition net operating losses related to surfcontrol s us operations for which no tax benefit was recorded due to the uncertainty of the future utilization of these losses 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for websense beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we are currently evaluating both the timing and the impact of the pending adoption of these standards on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and retained earnings of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents of million and retained earnings of million 
during  we used our cash to pay down million of principal on our senior secured term loan and an additional approximately million of our cash to repurchase our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily a result of our cash collections increasing by approximately million due principally to improved accounts receivable collection performance and increased sales resulting from new  renewed and upgraded subscriptions including sales of new products  decreased cash expenses of approximately million principally associated with decreased interest payments as a result of a lower average outstanding loan balance and lower effective interest rates during and reduced cash tax payments  as well as a decrease in the settlement of liabilities of approximately million in compared to which included many non recurring surfcontrol related obligations and a litigation settlement 
our operating cash flow is significantly influenced by sales of new and renewal subscriptions  accounts receivable collections and cash operating expenses 
a decrease in sales of subscriptions or accounts receivable collections will negatively impact our operating cash flow 
we expect to continue to generate significant cash flow from operations in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million in the million change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of an increase of net maturities over purchases of marketable securities of approximately million during 
table of contents net cash used in financing activities was million in compared with million in the million decrease in net cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to reduced principal payments of million on the senior secured term loan offset by increased purchases of treasury stock of approximately million in compared to during the fourth quarter of  the us internal revenue service the irs issued notices of proposed adjustment related to the cost sharing arrangement between our us parent company and our irish subsidiary  including the amount of cost sharing buy in  as well as with respect to our claim of research and development tax credits and our income tax deductions for equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the amount of additional tax proposed by the irs totals approximately million  of which million relates to the amount of cost sharing buy in  million relates to research and development credits and million relates to equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the total additional tax proposed excludes interest  penalties and state income taxes  each of which may be significant  and a potential reduction in tax on the irish subsidiary 
the proposed adjustments also do not include the future impact that changes in our cost sharing arrangement could have on our effective tax rate 
as each audit progresses and is ultimately concluded  adjustments  if any  will be recorded in our financial statements from time to time in light of prevailing facts based on our and the taxing authority s respective positions on any disputed matters 
these adjustments may include the use of cash to pay taxes relating to the disputed matters 
in connection with the acquisition of surfcontrol in october  we entered into an amended and restated senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement 
the million senior secured credit facility consists of a five year million senior secured term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the senior secured term loan was fully funded on october   and the revolving line of credit remains unused 
through december   we have made principal payments totaling million on our senior secured term loan  reducing the outstanding balance to million 
the senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including pledges of stock of some of our subsidiaries subject to limitations in the case of foreign subsidiaries and by secured guarantees by our domestic subsidiaries 
the senior secured term loan bears interest at a spread above libor with the spread determined based upon our total leverage ratio  as defined in the senior credit agreement 
based on the total leverage ratio throughout  the spread on the senior secured term loan was libor plus basis points per annum and the fee for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility was basis points per annum 
the weighted average interest rate on the senior secured term loan at december  was 
the senior credit agreement contains financial covenants  including a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio  as well as affirmative and negative covenants 
among the negative covenants are restrictions on our ability to borrow money  including restrictions on a the incurrence of more than million of new debt  including capital leases subject to certain exceptions  b the incurrence of more than million in letters of credit  c the incurrence of more than to million of new debt  depending on our leverage ratio  to finance future acquisitions or d the assumption of more than million of new debt in connection with acquisitions 
the senior credit agreement provides that we must maintain hedge agreements so that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured credit facility is subject to fixed interest rate protection for a period of not less than years from the initial funding date 
on october  in conjunction with the funding of the senior secured credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of interest per annum and receive a floating rate interest payment based on three month libor on an equivalent amount 
the notional amount of the swap agreement was million on december  and it amortizes each quarter down to million on june  in addition  on october  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement to limit the maximum interest rate on a portion of our senior secured term loan to per annum 
the amount of principal subject to the cap agreement was million at december  and increases to million on june  both the interest rate swap and cap expire on september  
table of contents obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payment obligations by year thereafter total senior secured term loan scheduled principal payments estimated interest and fees operating leases other commitments total obligations under our senior credit agreement represent the future minimum principal debt payments due under the senior secured term loan 
estimated interest and fees expected to be incurred on the senior secured term loan are based on known rates and scheduled principal payments as of december  see note to the audited financial statements 
we lease our facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through over of our operating lease commitments are related to our corporate headquarters lease in san diego  which extends through december our corporate headquarters lease includes escalating rent payments from to the rent expense related to our worldwide office space leases are generally recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with gaap 
other commitments represent minimum contractual commitments for software licenses and automobile leases 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements have been excluded from the contractual payment obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
share repurchase program 
in  we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
in  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
in  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
on january   our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices 
in january  we adopted a b plan that provides for quarterly purchases of our common stock in open market transactions 
depending on market conditions and other factors  purchases by our agent under this program may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice to us 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of approximately million at an average price of per share through both our b repurchase plan and through open market purchases 
as of december   we had 
table of contents cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
on february   we amended our senior credit agreement to increase our capacity to repurchase shares of our common stock 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement  we are restricted from repurchasing our common stock for an aggregate purchase price that exceeds of the aggregate amount of our consolidated net income  as defined in our senior credit agreement  during the period from the effective date of the facility through the most recent quarter end for which we have filed quarterly financial statements 
based on our february  amendment  we can repurchase up to million of our common stock under our senior credit agreement as of december   excluding shares we had repurchased through december  we intend to purchase shares during the remainder of prospective capital needs 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances  accounts receivable balances  revolving credit balances and our ongoing cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  including our capital expenditures  debt repayment obligations and stock repurchases  if any  for at least the next months 
during  we made principal payments on our senior secured term loan of million and repurchased million of our common stock 
our cash requirements may increase for reasons we do not currently foresee or we may make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy that increase our cash requirements 
we may elect to raise funds for these purposes through capital markets transactions or debt or private equity transactions as appropriate 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating and capital requirements in interest bearing  investment grade money market funds

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and senior secured term loan 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments such as money market funds 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and the interest expense incurred on our senior secured term loan and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our money market funds and from our borrowings under our variable rate senior secured term loan used in connection with the acquisition of surfcontrol in october our senior credit agreement provides that we must maintain hedge agreements so that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured term loan is subject to fixed interest rate protection for a period of not less than years from the date of the initial funding of the loan 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would materially affect our interest expense 
however  the impact of this type of adverse movement would be partially mitigated by our interest rate swap and cap agreements 
based on our outstanding senior secured term loan balance at december  and taking into consideration our interest rate swap and cap  our interest expense would increase by approximately  during if there were a basis point adverse move in the interest rate yield curve 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive investments at december  changes in interest rates over time will  however  affect our interest income 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and zero cost collar contracts to hedge foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets  liabilities and expenses 
we bill certain international customers in euros  british pounds  australian dollars  chinese renminbi and japanese yen 
we also keep working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries in the local currencies in which they do business 
as exchange rate fluctuations can significantly vary our sales and expense results when converted to us dollars  our objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes
