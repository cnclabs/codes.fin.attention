overview 
we are engaged primarily in the ownership and operation of multifamily residential units 
we also provide asset and property management services to third party owners of multifamily residential units for which we are paid fees 
our primary source of cash and revenue from operations is rents from the leasing of owned apartment units  which represented of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  the operating performance of our properties is affected by general economic trends including  but not limited to  factors such as household formation  job growth  unemployment rates  population growth  immigration  the supply of new multifamily rental communities and in certain markets the supply of other housing alternatives  such as condominiums  single and multifamily rental homes and owner occupied single and multifamily homes 
additionally  our performance may be affected by the access to and cost of debt and equity 
rental revenue collections are a combination of rental rates  occupancy levels and rent concessions 
we attempt to adjust these factors to adapt to changing market conditions  thus allowing us to maximize rental revenue 
indicators that we use in measuring these factors include physical occupancy and net collected rent per unit 
these indicators are more fully described in the results of operations comparison 
additionally  we consider property noi and ffo to be important indicators of our overall performance 
property noi property operating revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties and has the largest impact on our financial condition and operating results 
ffo is used in the real estate industry as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of real estate companies because it excludes charges such as real estate depreciation that are generally considered not to be reflective of the actual value of real estate assets over time 
additionally  gains and losses from the sale of most real estate assets and certain other items are also excluded from ffo 
see selected financial data presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for reconciliations of noi and ffo to consolidated net income attributable to aerc in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our same community portfolio for the years and consists of properties containing  units and accounted for of total revenue in and of our property noi 
same community noi decreased in compared to primarily as a result of a million or reduction in noi from our southeast portfolio 
our midwest portfolio  however  increased noi  or while our mid atlantic portfolio remained relatively flat in the following table presents noi results for and year ended december  in thousands noi noi same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties total property noi service company noi construction and other services noi total noi our earnings guidance does not include any acquisitions or dispositions 
however  we intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions when our investment criteria warrant an acquisition 
moreover  we will consider land development opportunities now that we again have the in house construction expertise available through merit enterprises  our wholly owned subsidiary 
we also may sell properties where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide over time a significantly greater return on equity  an increase in cash flow or further enhance our strategic objectives 
we are also focused on reducing the ratio of our total debt to gross real estate assets and the overall interest charges on our borrowings  which at december   had a weighted average rate of 
in january  we raised approximately million in a public offering of million common shares 
these proceeds were used to repay the million borrowings on our revolver and to prepay a million mortgage loan that was to mature in june in order to maximize property noi  we plan to continue to focus our efforts on improving revenue  controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the property level  both regionally and portfolio wide 
in  at the midpoint of our guidance  we expect same community noi to decrease and we expect property revenue to decrease while property operating expenses increase compared to however  the uncertainties caused by current economic conditions and the unprecedented financial crisis complicate our ability to forecast future performance 
we believe that the apartment industry is better situated to weather the recession than other real estate sectors because people will normally choose shelter over discretionary spending such as going to the mall or hotel stays and because government sponsored agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac continue to provide attractive apartment financing  which may be unavailable to other commercial real estate sectors 
however  our expectations may be adversely impacted if recessionary forces accelerate or congress curtails fannie mae or freddie mac financing support to the apartment industry 
federal income taxes 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with our taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing we continue to qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
however  our service companies are subject to federal income tax 
a reit is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another reit  and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer 
as an exception to this prohibition  a reit is allowed to own up to of the securities of a trs that can provide non customary services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its tenants 
however  no more than of the value of a reit s total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs s 
the amount of intercompany interest and other expenses between a trs and a reit are subject to arms length allocations 
we have elected trs status for all of our service companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity 
significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows significant cash sources uses year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operations fixed assets property land acquisitions and development expenditures  net net property land disposition proceeds recurring  revenue enhancing and non recurring capital expenditures debt decrease in mortgage notes decrease increase in revolving credit facility borrowings cash dividends and operating partnership distributions paid purchase of preferred and or treasury shares our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations  short term borrowings on the unsecured revolver  our secured credit facility or project specific loans 
we believe that we are well positioned to weather the recent turmoil in the financial markets 
our debt repayment obligations are relatively modest 
six mortgage loans totaling approximately million were scheduled to mature in we have already repaid million of those debt obligations and we expect to repay the million balance with proceeds from our unsecured revolver or with proceeds from other secured loans 
in december  we entered into a credit facility agreement with wells fargo multifamily corporation on behalf of freddie mac 
pursuant to the terms of the facility  we have the potential to borrow up to million over a two year period with obligations being secured by nonrecourse  non cross collateralized fixed or variable rate mortgages having terms of five  seven or ten years 
our million unsecured revolver  which matures march   provides us additional financial flexibility 
our ability to reenter the capital markets affords us additional liquidity as demonstrated by our recent successful sale to the public markets of  of our common shares resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
cash flow provided by operations increased during compared to primarily due to changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
these changes were primarily the result of an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation  the payment of real estate taxes in related to the sale of properties and the payment of other liabilities in related to funds held for managed properties and our exit from the affordable housing management business 
cash flow provided by operations decreased in compared to primarily due to the payment of real estate taxes in related to the sale of properties and the payment of other liabilities in related to funds held for managed properties and our exit from the affordable housing management business 
this decrease was partially offset by increased cash flow from property operations in when compared to shelf availability 
we have a shelf registration statement that became effective in may this registration statement relates to possible offerings  from time to time  of debt securities  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
this registration statement will expire in may in january  we issued million of new common shares under this registration statement 
securities offerings up to million are available under this shelf registration statement  after giving effect to the january common share offering 
however  before any debt securities could be issued under this shelf registration  major modifications to the debt covenants contained in the indenture currently in place would be necessary 
liquidity normal business operations 
we anticipate that we will meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations 
we believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections  other sources  such as the unsecured revolver  secured and unsecured borrowings are or can be made available and should be sufficient to meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements 
liquidity non operational activities 
sources of cash available for repayment of debt  completing our unit expansion project at our river forest property  any property acquisitions and funding other capital expenditures are expected to be provided primarily by proceeds from the refinancing of debt borrowings  our unsecured revolver and possibly the sale of common shares

as of december  there were  op units remaining having a carrying value of million  and  of the original  op units had been redeemed 
these transactions had the effect of increasing our interest in the downreit partnership from to

acquisitions and development 
on april   we acquired two apartment communities located in the richmond  virginia metropolitan area totaling units for a purchase price of million and additional closing costs of  the acquisition also included a acre land parcel adjacent to one of the properties on which we are constructing an additional units 
we expect to complete this construction during we intend to continue to evaluate land and property acquisitions

the net loss from continuing operations decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of a million decrease in interest expense  which was primarily due to decreased debt defeasance prepayment costs  and an increase in equity in net income loss of joint ventures of million primarily resulting from the above referenced sale of our last joint venture property in the following chart is intended to reflect the amount and percentage change in line items that are relevant to the changes in overall operating performance increase decrease when comparing the years ended december  in thousands to to property revenue fees  reimbursements and other property operating and maintenance expense items personnel real estate taxes and insurance utilities depreciation and amortization direct property management and service company expenses general and administrative interest expense gain on insurance recoveries n a n a equity in net income loss of joint ventures n a loss income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations property revenue 
property revenue is impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels  ie  net collected rent per unit 
physical occupancy at the end of each period and net collected rent per unit are presented in the following tables physical occupancy for the year ended december  same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties average monthly net collected rent per unit for the year ended december  same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase of  contributed by the acquired properties 
property revenue for the same community properties decreased  primarily due to reductions in net rent potential rent less concessions and increases in the amount of vacancy losses in the southeast portfolio 
property revenues increased in compared to primarily as a result of million contributed by the acquired properties and an increase of million in the same community properties which was primarily due to stable occupancy throughout the majority of combined with rental rate increases and an overall reduction in concessions 
fees  reimbursements and other 
the management and service operations saw a decrease of  in fee revenue in compared to and a reduction of million in fee revenue in compared to primarily as a result of the loss of management fee revenue associated with our exit from the affordable housing fee management business at the end of and the resulting reduction in management fee revenue from properties formerly managed for third party owners 
reimbursement of expense from managed properties decreased  in compared to and million in compared to also as a result of the reduction of the number of properties managed 
this reduction had no impact to the net loss from continuing operations as these reimbursements are also included in direct property management expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses remained flat for the same community properties in compared to as well as in compared to however  total property operating and maintenance expenses for the entire portfolio increased during both comparison periods because of the additional expenses related to the acquired properties 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in compared to and increased in compared to primarily as a result of the month to month amortization periods of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquired properties 
direct property management and service company expenses 
direct property management and service company expenses decreased in compared to and in compared to as a result of the reduction in the number of properties managed for third party owners 
the reimbursement of expenses from the managed properties decreased in both comparison periods as previously noted 
however  this reduction had no impact to the net loss from continuing operations as these reimbursements are also included in fees  reimbursements and other revenue 
additionally  service company expenses  which represent the portion of general and administrative expense that relates to the management of third party owned properties  decreased million in compared to due to the reduction in the number of properties managed 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense increased in primarily as a result an increase in directors deferred compensation in compared to this was primarily a result of valuation adjustments of the directors deferred compensation based upon the closing price of our common shares at the end of each period 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction to payroll expenses in compared to general and administrative expense decreased in compared to primarily as a result of the reduction in costs allocated to direct property management and service company expenses  as noted above  an increase in of  related to pre acquisition and other project costs  and an increase in deferred directors compensation expense in of  these increases were partially offset by decreases in payroll related costs in of  primarily as a result of our exit from the affordable housing fee management business in the director s deferred compensation plan was modified effective january   to provide that all distributions under the plan will be in the form of our common shares instead of cash 
as a result  the value of the deferred compensation will no longer be adjusted based upon the closing price of our common shares 
distributions with a commencement date of december  or earlier will continue to be made in cash  however the value of these units was fixed as of december   in accordance with the original terms of the plan 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased in compared to primarily due to the receipt in the first quarter of of refunds totaling  of defeasance costs in connection with certain previously defeased loans and decreased interest expense of  for borrowings on our revolver 
interest expense decreased in compared to primarily due to a reduction of million in defeasance prepayment costs that were included in income from continuing operations 
interest expense  including defeasance prepayment costs that are associated with discontinued operations are included in income from discontinued operations  as discussed below 
gain on insurance recoveries 
during  we settled a wind storm damage insurance claim involving of our central ohio properties for the aggregate sum of  net of our deductible 
also included in this category was a settlement of  net of our deductible in connection with a clubhouse fire at one of our ohio properties 
the gain on insurance recoveries recorded during represents insurance proceeds to be received net of the carrying value of the assets written off and costs incurred to make repairs 
equity in net income loss of joint ventures 
on december   the joint venture in which we were a partner sold the affordable housing property that it owned 
our proportionate share of the gain recognized in was million 
income from discontinued operations 
included in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  are the operating results and the gains related to two wholly owned properties that were sold in  wholly owned properties that were sold in  and three wholly owned properties that were sold in the operating loss from discontinued operations in was primarily due to costs incurred to defease loans that were secured by properties that were sold 
for further details on income from discontinued operations  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
discount premium on preferred share repurchase 
in and  we repurchased  and  respectively  of our preferred depositary shares  which each represent th of a share of our class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares 
the depositary shares have a recorded value of per share 
the average price that we paid per share for the repurchases was  and we therefore recognized a total discount of million 
the average price that we paid per share for the repurchases was  and we therefore recognized a premium of  inflation 
we believe that the effects of inflation only minimally impacts our operational performance because our leases are mostly for month terms  which allows us the opportunity to increase our new lease and lease renewal rents to account for inflationary price increases 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries  the service companies and the operating partnership structured as a downreit 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
in performing this analysis  we estimate holding periods of the assets  changes in fair market value of the assets and cash flows related to the operations of the assets to determine the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives under consideration by management 
should the estimates used to determine alternatives or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
we review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
in performing this analysis  we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider 
should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
we estimate the fair value of share based compensation awarded 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options  and the monte carlo method to estimate the fair value of restricted share awards in which the number of shares that will ultimately vest are subject to market conditions 
the use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining certain of the assumptions used by these valuation models 
if we had used different judgment and or estimates  different valuations would have been produced that may have resulted in a material change to our results of operations 
we also estimate future performance results related to certain share based awards 
if the results vary from our estimate  it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
we estimate the amount of real estate taxes for which we will be liable based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments 
in most circumstances  the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and consequently these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
based on our variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  an interest rate change of basis points would impact interest expense by approximately  and  on an annual basis  respectively 
additionally  we have interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
we have  and will continue to manage  interest rate risk as follows i maintain what we believe to be a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii consider the use of treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
we use various financial models and advisors to assist us in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives

we have reviewed tangible long lived assets and other agreements for associated asset retirement obligations aros and have determined that we do not have any material aros that would require recognition as a liability or disclosure in our financial statements at december  phase i environmental audits were obtained at the time of the ipo  property acquisition or property refinancing  as the case may be  on all of our wholly owned properties 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted
