item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors 
see the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements set forth at the beginning of part i of the annual report on form k 
overview we are a mall based specialty retailer of action sports related apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories operating under the zumiez brand name 
as of january   we operated stores primarily located in shopping malls  giving us a presence in states 
our stores cater to young men and women between the ages of and who seek popular brands representing a lifestyle centered on activities that include skateboarding  surfing  snowboarding  bmx and motocross 
we support the action sports lifestyle and promote our brand through a multi faceted marketing approach that is designed to integrate our brand image with our customers activities and interests 
this approach  combined with our differentiated merchandising strategy  store design  comprehensive training programs and passionate employees  allows us to provide an experience for our customers that we believe is consistent with their attitudes  fashion tastes and identities and is otherwise unavailable in most malls 
fiscal a review of this past year fiscal was a difficult year for zumiez however  while the first two quarters of the year were abnormally challenging  the second half of the year saw improvement in the us economy 
historically  we have made the majority of our profits in the second half of the year due to the seasonal nature of our business  so as the recession pressures eased in the back half of fiscal  our sales and profits were better 
as the economy improved  we saw traffic increases in our stores and less promotional activity from our competitors 
the first six months of fiscal saw our same store sales decrease and we had a diluted loss per share of  a decrease of from the first six months of fiscal the second half of fiscal saw a marked improvement relative to the first half and slight improvement over the second half of fiscal for the second half of fiscal  the six months ended january   our same store sales declined and our diluted earnings per share increased or fiscal a look at the upcoming year we believe it is difficult to gauge the long term effects the recent global financial and economic crises will have on consumer spending  the prospects of an economic recovery  and what these factors will have on our financial performance 
in the second half of fiscal  we began to see some encouraging trends  but our comparable store sales were negative and our earnings results were still below historical levels 
our current outlook remains cautious and overall we are planning the business conservatively in  however we will also be making some strategic investments that will enhance product placement  improve supply chain efficiencies and drive sales through multiple channels 
while we expect these investments will benefit our financial performance long term  they should have a nominal impact in these investments will result in higher capital expenditures in compared to  however  we expect to open fewer stores during the year 
our current forecast projects sustained working capital similar to previous years  adequate cash and investments  no borrowings on our credit facility and positive cash flow from operations 
inventory levels per square foot should be in line with or slightly above levels 
we believe our earnings will increase in fiscal if our same store sales increase 
general net sales constitute gross sales net of estimated returns 
net sales include our in store sales and our ecommerce sales  which includes ecommerce shipping revenue 
information in this report with respect to comparable store sales  includes our ecommerce sales 
ecommerce sales were of total net sales for fiscal through fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal sales of gift cards are deferred and recognized when gift cards are redeemed 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account our estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered gift card breakage 
gift card breakage is recognized as revenue after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
we report comparable store sales based on net sales beginning on the first anniversary of the first day of operation of a new store 
our comparable store sales also include our ecommerce sales 
changes in our comparable store sales between two periods are based on net sales of stores which were in operation during both of the two periods being compared and  if a store is included in the calculation of comparable store sales for only a portion of one of the two periods being compared  then that store is included in the calculation for only the comparable portion of the other period 
any change in square footage of an existing comparable store  including remodels  does not eliminate that store from inclusion in the calculation of comparable store sales 
there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other apparel retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 
as a result  data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 
cost of sales consists of branded merchandise costs  and our private label merchandise including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs 
our cost of sales also includes shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  occupancy and distribution and warehousing costs 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of goods sold 
we do receive insignificant amounts of cash consideration from vendors which have been reported as a reduction of expenses or inventory on hand  as the amounts are reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs of selling the vendors products 
with respect to the freight component of our ecommerce sales  we arrange and pay the freight for our customers and bill them for this service 
such amounts billed are included in revenue and the related freight cost is charged to cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of store personnel wages and benefits  administrative staff and infrastructure expenses  out bound freight  store supplies  depreciation on leasehold improvements at our home office and stores  facility expenses  and training  advertising and marketing costs 
credit card fees  insurance  public company expenses  legal expenses and other miscellaneous operating costs are also included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will  as described below  increase in future periods due in part to increased expenses associated with opening new stores 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demands 
any inability to provide appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which we consider key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales 
as previously described in detail under the caption general  comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
our management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies and rent 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit 
gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating profit 
we view operating profit as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses  and our level of capital expenditures affecting depreciation expense 
store productivity 
store productivity  including net sales per average square foot  average unit retail price  the number of transactions per store  dollars per transaction  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by our management in assessing our operational performance 
in addition  we review our stores operating income as a measure of their profitability 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  selected items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percent of net sales fiscal year ended february  january  january  net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating profit interest income earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal results compared with fiscal net income net income in fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  a decrease of

the decline in comparable store sales was driven by a decrease in comparable store transactions and all merchandise categories experienced comparable store sales declines except footwear 
for information as to how we define comparable stores  see general above 
the decrease in total net sales was due to a decline in net sales from comparable stores of approximately million  mostly offset by an increase in non comparable store sales of approximately million

seasonality and quarterly results as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences 
as a result  we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating results 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  while the winter holiday and back to school periods historically have accounted for the largest percentage of our annual net sales 
quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores  fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  changes in merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions  competition and weather conditions 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the last two recent years 
the unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and includes all adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
this information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the operating results for any fiscal quarter are not indicative of the operating results for a full fiscal year or for any future period and there can be no assurance that any trend reflected in such results will continue in the future 
fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except per share data net sales gross profit operating profit loss net income loss basic net loss income per share diluted net loss income per share number of stores open end of period comparable store sales increase decrease liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are for capital investments  inventory  store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements such as technology enhancements and distribution capabilities 
historically  our main sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  marketable securities and receivables  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale  while we typically have longer payment terms with our vendors 
as of january   we held one million auction rate security valued at million  net of approximately million temporary impairment charge 
the million security failed to sell at its scheduled auction in march the interest rate for the security reset to a prescribed tax free rate of 
we previously held another million auction rate security that was redeemed at par in may we currently do not intend to hold the security beyond the next auction date and will try to sell this security when the auction date comes up in march however  uncertainties in the credit markets this fiscal year have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of auction rate securities in auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
if the march auction fails  we plan to hold the security until the next auction date and the security coupon rate will reset to a prescribed failure rate 
an unsuccessful auction could result in our holding the security beyond the next scheduled auction reset date if a secondary market does not develop  therefore  limiting the short term liquidity of the investment 
the security has been classified in long term assets on our consolidated balances sheet as of january  and january  fiscal cash flow summary we ended fiscal with approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  compared with approximately million at the end of fiscal working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  was at the end of fiscal  up from approximately million at the end of fiscal the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital were due primarily to the reduced cash out flow from opening fewer stores in fiscal and increased cash flow from operations 
our capital requirements include construction and fixture costs related to the opening of new stores and remodeling expenditures for existing stores 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of new store openings  the availability of suitable locations for new stores  and the nature of arrangements negotiated with landlords 
in that regard  our net investment to open a new store has varied significantly in the past due to a number of factors  including the geographic location and size of the new store  and is likely to vary significantly in the future 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million on capital expenditures  a majority of which related to leasehold improvements and fixtures for the new stores we opened in fiscal  and a smaller amount related to information technology projects 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands 
fiscal year ended february  january  january  total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable  income taxes payable and cash flow resulting from decreased inventory  partially offset by a decrease in net income in fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the change in the effect of the tax benefit from stock option exercises from fiscal to  partially offset by a decrease in net income 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures for new store openings and existing store renovations of million and by net purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures for new store openings and existing store renovations of million partially offset by net sales of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures for new store openings and existing store renovations of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million related to proceeds from stock option exercise and the associated tax benefits 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million primarily related to short term use of bank funds partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercise and associated tax benefits 
net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal was million  primarily related to proceeds from stock option exercise and associated tax benefits 
sources of liquidity our most significant sources of liquidity continue to be funds generated by operating activities  available cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we expect these sources of liquidity and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash requirements for operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
beyond this time frame  if cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current shareholders 
on june   we renewed and amended our secured credit agreement with wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na  and the prior facility agreement was terminated 
the credit agreement provides us with a secured revolving credit facility until september  of up to million 
the secured revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of a standby letter of credit in an amount not to exceed million outstanding at any time and with a term not to exceed days 
the commercial line of credit provides for the issuance of a commercial letter of credit in an amount not to exceed million and with terms not to exceed days 
the amount of borrowings available at any time under our secured revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at that time 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility at january  or january  the company had open commercial letters of credit outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility of million at january  and approximately million at january  the secured revolving credit facility bears interest at the daily one month libor rate plus 
the credit agreement contains a number of restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  undergo a change in ownership and enter into certain transactions 
the credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain specified financial tests and ratios  including  a maximum net loss not to exceed million after taxes on a trailing four quarter basis provided  that  there shall be added to net income all charges for impairment of goodwill and store assets not to exceed million in aggregate  and a minimum quick ratio of 
the quick ratio is defined as our cash and near cash equivalents plus certain defined receivables divided by the outstanding borrowings 
all of our personal property  including  among other things  our inventory  equipment and fixtures  has been pledged to secure our obligations under the credit agreement 
we must also provide financial information and statements to our lender 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at january  capital expenditures our capital expenditures for fiscal were million including the opening of new stores and remodeled stores at a cost of million  and million in information technology projects and other improvements 
fiscal expenditures included million related to investment in new stores and remodeled stores 
additionally  we continued to support our infrastructure growth by investing million in information technology projects and other improvements 
in upcoming fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures  a majority of which will relate to leasehold improvements and fixtures for the new stores we plan to open in fiscal  and the acquisition costs of our new distribution center in corona  california 
there can be no assurance that the number of stores that we actually open in fiscal will not be different from the number of stores we plan to open  or that actual fiscal capital expenditures will not differ from this expected amount 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the fiscal year ended january  our operating lease obligations are not recognized as liabilities in the financial statements 
the following table summarizes the total amount of future payments in thousands due under certain of our contractual obligations as of january  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations letters of credit we occupy our retail stores and combined home office and distribution center under operating leases generally with terms of five to ten years 
some of our leases have early cancellation clauses  which permit the lease to be terminated by us if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods 
some leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to five years under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases 
in addition to future minimum lease payments  substantially all of our store leases provide for additional rental payments or percentage rent if sales at the respective stores exceed specified levels  as well as the payment of common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes unless guaranteed in the lease agreement 
amounts in the above table do not include percentage rent  common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes unless these costs are fixed and determinable 
most of our lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions  which we have straight lined over the term of the lease  including any lease renewals deemed to be probable 
for certain locations  we receive cash tenant allowances and we have reported these amounts as a deferred liability that is amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease  including any lease renewals deemed to be probable 
rent expense  including common area maintenance and other occupancy costs  was million  million and million for fiscal  and at january   we had outstanding purchase orders to acquire merchandise from vendors for approximately million 
we have an option to cancel these commitments with no notice prior to shipment  except for private label purchase orders 
at january   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
off balance sheet obligations our only off balance sheet contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  related to operating lease obligations and letters of credit 
we have excluded these items from our balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we presently do not have any non cancelable inventory purchase commitments  except purchase orders for private label merchandise 
at january   we had outstanding purchase orders to acquire merchandise from vendors for approximately million 
these purchases are expected to be financed by cash flows from operations 
we have an option to cancel these commitments with no notice prior to shipment except for our private label purchase orders 
at january   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
at january   we were committed to property owners for operating lease obligations in the approximate amount of million 
most of our leases contain cancellation or kick out clauses in our favor that relieve us from any future obligation under a lease if specified sales levels are not achieved by a specific date 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our net sales or operating results for the past three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  exhibits and consolidated financial statements  of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon purchase by customers at our retail store locations or upon shipment for orders placed through our website as both title and risk of loss have transferred 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
revenue is not recorded on sale of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon sale  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account our estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered gift card breakage 
gift card breakage is recognized as revenue after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions regarding future sales returns and the amount and timing of gift cards projected to be redeemed by gift card recipients 
our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns and gift cards to be redeemed is based primarily on historical transaction experience 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to measure sales returns or recognize revenue for our gift card program during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our sales return reserve at january   would have affected net income by approximately  in fiscal a change in our unredeemed gift card breakage life at january   would have affected net income by up to  in fiscal valuation of merchandise inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value through the establishment of write down and inventory loss reserves 
our write down reserve represents the excess of the carrying value  typically average cost  over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sales or other disposal of the inventory 
write downs establish a new cost basis for our inventory 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded write downs or an increase in that newly established cost basis 
our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses shrinkage reserve that have occurred since the last physical inventory dates 
each quarter  we reserve for anticipated physical inventory losses on an aggregate basis 
our write down reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on the current rate of sales  the age of inventory and other factors 
our inventory loss reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including historical percentages that can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a decrease in ultimate sales price at january   would have affected net income by approximately  in fiscal a difference in actual physical inventory shrinkage reserved at january   would have affected net income by approximately  in fiscal description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions long lived assets impairment we review the carrying value of our leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flow to the asset carrying values 
declines in projected store cash flow could result in the impairment of assets 
the actual economic lives of these assets may be different than our estimated useful lives  thereby resulting in a different carrying value 
these evaluations could result in a change in the depreciable lives of those assets and therefore our depreciation expense in future periods 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting future sales  gross profit and operating expenses and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  considering other publicly available market information  and where appropriate by use of an independent valuation firm 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of reporting units 
forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate economic factors and the profitability of future business operations 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
a decrease in the fair value of the company as of january  would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill 
asset retirement obligations an asset retirement obligation aro represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition  construction  development  or normal operation of that long lived asset 
our aro s are primarily associated with leasehold improvements  which  at the end of a lease  we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with certain lease agreements 
the aro is recorded in leasehold improvements and equipment and other current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at january  and will be subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value 
the associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and depreciated over its useful life 
the aro recorded contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and judgments to estimate the costs associated with closing a store  the timing of future estimated costs to a store and the credit risk and interest rate assumptions 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our aro s 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be significant 
a change in our estimated aro liability at january   would have affected net income by approximately  description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions stock based compensation we maintain a equity incentive plan under which non qualified stock options and restricted stock have been granted to employees and non employee directors 
in determining the fair value of our share based issuances  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
we determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards based on the closing market price of our stock on the grant date 
the calculation of stock based compensation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the inputs to the black scholes option pricing model  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended january   would have affected net income by approximately  in fiscal accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the financial statements  income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
for example  our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in the relevant tax  accounting and other laws  regulations  principles and interpretations 
although management believes that the income tax related judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
upon income tax audit  any unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are susceptible to market value fluctuations with regard to our short term investments 
however  due to the relatively short maturity period of those investments and our intention and ability to hold those investments until maturity  the risk of material market value fluctuations is not expected to be significant 
during different times of the year  due to the seasonality of our business  we may borrow under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent we borrow under our revolving credit facility  which bears interest at the daily one month libor rate plus  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility 
at january   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates did not have a material effect on the results of operations in fiscal interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in market interest rates as a result of our short term and long term investments in tax exempt us treasuries  municipal bonds  taxable agency bonds  and auction rate securities  which have long term contractual maturities but feature variable interest rates that reset at short term intervals 
we also invest in long term agency bonds 
if our current portfolio average yield rate decreases by in fiscal  our net income will decrease by approximately million 
our current expectation is that our investment yields will remain low in due to historically low interest rates 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical yield rates on our cash  short term and long term investment balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall investments that could happen in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our investments structure
