item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the license of our software products  and from consulting  hosting  and support and maintenance services 
primarily  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 

table of contents multiple element arrangements we recognize revenue under multiple element arrangements using the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements under the arrangement 
under the residual method  the arrangement consideration is first allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value for each element and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements 
arrangement consideration allocated to undelivered elements is deferred and recognized as revenue when the elements are delivered  if all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we have established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence for the value of our consulting  training  and other services  based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
vsoe of the fair value of maintenance services may also be determined based on a substantive renewal clause  if any  within a customer contract 
accordingly  software license revenue is recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with maintenance  consulting  training or other services 
license revenue we receive and recognize licensing fees and royalty revenue from original equipment manufacturer oem and independent software vendor isv customers for font rendering and page composition technologies  direct and indirect licenses of software publishing applications for the creation  enhancement  management  transport  viewing and printing of electronic information  direct sales of custom design and consulting services to end users such as graphic artists  desktop publishers  corporations and resellers  and sales of fonts and publishing applications to foreign customers primarily through distributors and resellers 
certain oem and isv customers pay royalties only upon the sublicensing of our products to end users 
revenue in such transactions is recognized in the period when sublicenses to end users are reported to us by our oem or isv customers 
revenue from guaranteed minimum royalty licenses is recognized upon delivery of the software license when no further obligations of the company exist 
in certain guaranteed minimum royalty licenses  we will enter into extended payment programs with creditworthy customers 
revenue related to extended payment programs is recognized when payment becomes due to the company 
we recognize license revenue from the resale of our products through various resellers 
resellers may sell our products in either an electronic format or cd format 
revenue is recognized if collection is probable  upon notification from the reseller that it has sold the product  or for a cd product  upon delivery of the software 
revenue from end user product sales is recognized upon delivery of the software  net of estimated returns and allowances  and when collection is probable 
revenue related to extended payment programs is recognized when payment becomes due to the company 
end user sales include e commerce revenue generated from our websites from the licensing of bitstream fonts  subscription licenses for our browser  licensing of fonts developed by third parties and from fees received from referring customers to other sites for which we have referral agreements 
referral revenue is recognized at the net amount received by bitstream and for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
there are minimal costs associated with the referral program  and primarily represent the time to load copies of the fonts provided by each participating foundry for addition to the myfonts 
com database 
we expense those costs as incurred 
service revenue professional services include custom design and development  and training 
we recognize professional services revenue under software development contracts as services are provided for per diem contracts or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term fixed price contracts 
provisions for any estimated losses on contracts are made in the period in which such losses become probable 
we recognize revenue from support and maintenance agreements ratably over the term of the agreement 

table of contents deferred revenue includes unearned software support and maintenance revenue  advance billings under contracts  and advanced billings for unrecognized revenue from licenses 
cost of revenue from software licenses consists primarily of royalties paid to third party developers and foundries whose products we sell  and costs to distribute the product  including the cost of the media on which it is delivered 
cost of revenue from services consists primarily of costs associated with customer support  consulting and custom product development services 
we generally warrant that our products will function substantially in accordance with documentation provided to customers for approximately days following initial delivery 
we have not incurred any material expenses related to warranty claims 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance and have elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and awards 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and awards 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments 
table of contents that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the application of these principles using authoritative guidance may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance  we tested recorded goodwill for impairment 
we have determined that we do not have separate reporting units and thus goodwill is tested for impairment based upon an enterprise wide valuation 
we conducted impairment testing as of december  and determined that the fair value of the enterprise was greater than its carrying value 
although none of the goodwill was impaired  there can be no assurance that  upon completion of a future review  a material impairment charge will not be required 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we have had to increase these reserves throughout as the downturn in the global economy has affected our customers and made collections from certain customers difficult 
we cannot guarantee that our credit loss rates won t continue to worsen or that we will experience the similar credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery unlikely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
determination of our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment 
we have fully reserved against our tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
we base our valuation allowance on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the determination of the valuation allowance requires us to make estimates  which we cannot guarantee will prove to be accurate
