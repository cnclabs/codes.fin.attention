item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to our critical accounting estimates discussed below and important factors set forth in this annual report  including under risk factors in item a of this annual report 
overview our business we are a global pharmaceutical company focused on advancing the treatment of critical care patients through the delivery of innovative  cost effective medicines to the worldwide hospital marketplace 
we have two marketed products  angiomax bivalirudin and cleviprex clevidipine butyrate injectable emulsion  and a pipeline of critical care hospital products in development  including two late stage development product candidates  cangrelor and oritavancin  two early stage development product candidates  cu and apoa i milano  and marketing rights in the united states and canada to a ready to use formulation of argatroban for which a new drug application  or nda  has been submitted to the us food and drug administration  or fda 
we believe that angiomax  cleviprex and our products in development possess favorable attributes that competitive products do not provide  can satisfy unmet medical needs in the critical care hospital product market and offer  or  in the case of our products in development  have the potential to offer  improved performance to hospital businesses 
we market and sell angiomax and cleviprex in the united states with a sales force that  as of february   consisted of representatives and managers experienced in selling to hospital customers 
in europe  we market and sell angiox with a sales force that  as of february   consisted of representatives and managers experienced in selling to hospital customers 
our revenues to date have been generated primarily from sales of angiomax in the united states  but we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts in europe 
we believe that by establishing operations in europe for angiox  we will be positioned to commercialize our pipeline of critical care product candidates in europe  if and when they are approved 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for company acquisitions and license of rights to products  clinical trials  nonclinical and preclinical studies  activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we outsource much of our clinical trials  nonclinical and preclinical studies and all of our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  general corporate activities and costs associated with marketing and promotional activities 
research and development expense  selling  general and administrative expense and cost of revenue also include stock based compensation expense  which we allocate based on the responsibilities of the recipients of the stock based compensation 
except for and  we have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products  including costs and expenses associated with clinical trials  nonclinical and preclinical studies  regulatory approvals and commercialization 
although we achieved profitability in and in  we have not been profitable on an annual basis since we will likely need to generate significantly greater revenue in future periods to achieve and maintain profitability in light of our planned expenditures 
angiomax patent term the principal us patent covering angiomax expires on march  we will then have a six month period of market exclusivity for angiomax in the united states which will expire on september  due to our study of angiomax in the pediatric setting 
we applied  under the hatch waxman act  for an extension of the term of the principal patent 
however  the united states patent trademark office  or pto  rejected our application because in its view the application was not timely filed 
we have filed suit against the pto  the fda and the us department of health and human services seeking to set aside the denial of our application to 
table of contents extend the term of the principal patent 
we have also sought legislative action to address the matter 
in addition  the pto recently issued two patents to us covering a more consistent and improved angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made 
in october and january  we filed suit against pharmaceutical companies which have filed abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  with the fda for generic versions of angiomax  alleging infringement of the two recently issued patents 
if we are unsuccessful in extending the term of the principal patent and depending on the protection afforded by our two new patents  angiomax could be subject to generic competition in the united states as early as september  in europe  the principal patent covering angiox expires in distribution and sales we distribute angiomax and cleviprex in the united states through a sole source distribution model 
under this model  we sell angiomax and cleviprex to our sole source distributor  integrated commercialization solutions  inc  or ics  which then sells angiomax and cleviprex to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the united states and in certain cases  directly to hospitals 
our agreement with ics  which we initially entered into february  provides that ics will be our exclusive distributor of angiomax and cleviprex in the united states 
under the terms of this fee for service agreement  ics assumes all credit and inventory risks  is subject to our standard return policy  places orders with us for sufficient quantities of angiomax and cleviprex to maintain an appropriate level of inventory based on our customers historical purchase volumes and has sole responsibility for determining the prices at which it sells angiomax and cleviprex  subject to specified limitations in the agreement 
the agreement terminates on february   but will automatically renew for additional one year periods unless either party gives notice at least days prior to the automatic extension 
we may also terminate the agreement at any time and for any reason upon prior written notice to ics and payment of a termination fee of between  and  in europe  we market and sell angiox with a sales force that  as of february   consisted of representatives and managers 
we also market and sell angiomax outside the united states through distributors  including sepracor inc  which distributes angiomax in canada  and affiliates of grupo ferrer internacional  which distribute angiox in greece  portugal and spain and in a number of countries in central america and south america 
we also have agreements with other third parties for other countries outside of the united states and europe  including israel and australia 
we are developing a global strategy for cleviprex in preparation for its potential approval outside of the united states 
the reacquisition of all development  commercial and distribution rights for angiox from nycomed danmark aps  or nycomed  in was our first step directly into international markets 
in july  we entered into a series of agreements with nycomed pursuant to which we terminated our prior distribution agreement with nycomed and re acquired all development  commercial and distribution rights for angiox in the european union excluding spain  portugal and greece and the former soviet republics  which we refer to as the nycomed territory 
prior to entering into the nycomed agreements  nycomed served as the exclusive distributor of angiox in the nycomed territory pursuant to a sales  marketing and distribution agreement  dated march   as amended 
pursuant to the nycomed agreements  we and nycomed agreed to transition the angiox rights held by nycomed to us 
under these arrangements  including a transitional distribution agreement  we assumed control of the marketing of angiox immediately and nycomed provided  on a transitional basis  sales operations services  until december  and product distribution services until the second half of we assumed control of the distribution of angiox in the nycomed territory during the second half of under the terms of the transitional distribution agreement with nycomed  upon the sale by nycomed to third parties of vials of angiox purchased by nycomed from us prior to july   which we refer to as existing inventory  nycomed agreed to pay us a specified percentage of nycomed s net sales of angiox  less the amount previously paid by nycomed to us for the existing inventory 
under the transitional distribution agreement  upon the termination of the agreement  nycomed had the right to return any existing inventory for the price paid by nycomed to us for such inventory 
we recorded a reserve of million in the fourth quarter of for the existing inventory at nycomed which we did not believe would be sold prior to the termination of the transitional distribution agreement and would be subject to return by nycomed in accordance with the agreement 
during  we reduced the reserve by million as nycomed sold a portion of its existing inventory during the year 
accordingly  we included within our accrual for product return at december  a reserve of million for existing inventory at nycomed that nycomed had the right to return at any time 
in july  we reimbursed nycomed million for the final amount of inventory held by nycomed at december  the transitional distribution agreement terminated on december  we incurred total costs of million in connection with the reacquisition of the rights to develop  distribute and market angiox in the nycomed territory 
these total costs include transaction fees of approximately million and agreed upon milestone 
table of contents payments of million paid to nycomed on july   million paid to nycomed on january  and million paid to nycomed on july   as well as an additional million paid to nycomed on july  in connection with our obtaining european commission approval to market angiox for acs in january during the third quarter of  we allocated million of these costs as expense attributable to the termination of the prior distribution agreement with nycomed and million to intangible assets 
the million expense was offset in part by the write off of approximately million of deferred revenue  which amount represented the unamortized portion of deferred revenue related to milestone payments received from nycomed in and we included such amounts in selling  general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  we allocated approximately million of the costs associated with the reacquisition of the rights to develop  distribute and market angiox in the european union to intangible assets 
we are amortizing these intangible assets over the remaining patent life of angiox  which expires in the period in which amortization expense will be recorded reflects the pattern in which we expect the economic benefits of the intangible assets to be consumed 
to support the marketing  sales and distribution efforts of angiomax  we are continuing to develop our business infrastructure outside the united states 
we initiated research to understand the pci market  as well as the hypertension market  on a global basis  including profiling hospitals and identifying key opinion leaders 
since reacquiring the development  commercial and distribution rights for angiox from nycomed  we have formed subsidiaries in the netherlands  switzerland  germany  france  italy  sweden  poland  denmark  austria  belgium  finland  norway and spain  in addition to our pre existing subsidiary in the united kingdom  in connection with the development of a business infrastructure to conduct the international sales and marketing of angiox 
we also obtained licenses and authorizations necessary to distribute angiox in the various countries in europe  hired new personnel and entered into third party arrangements to provide services  such as importation  packaging  quality control and distribution 
we believe that by establishing operations in europe for angiox  we will be positioned to commercialize our products in development  if and when they are approved 
business development activity our core strategy is to acquire  develop and commercialize products that we believe help hospitals treat patients more efficiently by improving the effectiveness and safety of treatment while reducing cost 
since  we have acquired or licensed a portfolio of critical care products that we are developing 
curacyte discovery acquisition 
in august  we acquired curacyte discovery gmbh  or curacyte discovery  a wholly owned subsidiary of curacyte ag 
curacyte discovery  a german limited liability company  was primarily engaged in the discovery and development of small molecule serine protease inhibitors 
its lead compound  cu  is being developed for the prevention of blood loss during surgery 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid curacyte ag an initial payment of million approximately million at the time of payment and million in december and agreed to pay contingent milestone payments of up to million if we proceed with further clinical development of cu and achieve a commercial milestone 
in addition  we agreed to pay royalties based on net sales 
the total cost of the curacyte acquisition was approximately million  which consisted of a purchase price of approximately million and direct acquisition costs of million 
since the acquisition date  we have included results of curacyte discovery s operations in our consolidated financial statements 
we allocated the purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a third party valuation and management estimates 
we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development  which we expensed upon completion of the acquisition 
we recorded this amount as research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended september  we allocated the remaining portion of the purchase price to net tangible assets 
targanta acquisition 
in february  we acquired targanta  a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative antibiotics to treat serious infections in the hospital and other institutional settings 
targanta s product pipeline included an intravenous version of oritavancin and a program to develop an oral version of oritavancin for the possible treatment of clostridium difficile infections  or c 
difficile 
under the terms of our agreement with targanta  we paid targanta shareholders an aggregate of approximately million at closing  and agreed to pay contingent cash payments up to an additional million in the aggregate  as described below 
table of contents upon approval from the emea for a maa for oritavancin for the treatment of absssi on or before december   approximately million if such approval is granted between january  and june   or approximately million if such approval is granted between july  and december  as of march   we have not filed an application with the emea for oritavancin for the treatment of absssi 
upon final approval from the fda for a new drug application  or nda  for oritavancin for the treatment of absssi within months after the date the first patient is enrolled in a phase clinical trial of absssi that is initiated by us and on or before december   approximately million in the aggregate 
upon final fda approval for an nda for the use of oritavancin for the treatment of absssi administered by a single dose intravenous infusion within months after the date the first patient is enrolled in a phase clinical trial of absssi that is initiated by us and on or before december   approximately million in the aggregate 
this payment may become payable simultaneously with the payment described in the previous bullet above 
if aggregate net sales of oritavancin in four consecutive calendar quarters ending on or before december  reach or exceed million  approximately million in the aggregate 
the transaction costs were expensed as incurred  the value of acquired in process research and development was capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset and contingent payments were recorded at their estimated fair value 
the results of targanta s operations since the acquisition date have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price of approximately million  which includes million of cash paid upon acquisition and million that represents the fair market value of the contingent purchase price on the date of acquisition  was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets of targanta based on their estimated fair values 
as a result of our acquisition of targanta  we are a party to an asset purchase agreement that targanta entered into with intermune  inc  or intermune  in connection with targanta s december acquisition of the worldwide rights to oritavancin from intermune 
under the agreement  we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop oritavancin and to make a million cash payment to intermune if and when we receive from the fda all approvals necessary for the commercial launch of oritavancin 
we have no other milestone or royalty obligations to intermune 
licensing arrangement with eagle 
in september  we licensed marketing rights in the united states and canada to a ready to use formulation of argatroban developed by eagle pharmaceuticals  inc  or eagle  for which eagle has submitted an nda 
under the license agreement with eagle  we paid eagle a million technology license fee 
we also agreed to pay additional approval and commercialization milestones up to a total of million and royalties 
eagle has agreed to supply us with the ready to use product under a supply agreement we entered into with it in september licensing arrangement with pfizer 
in december  we licensed exclusive worldwide rights to apoa milano from pfizer 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid pfizer an up front payment of million and agreed to make additional payments upon the achievement of clinical  regulatory and sales milestones up to a total of million 
we also agreed to pay pfizer single digit royalty payments on worldwide net sales of apoa milano 
we also paid million to third parties in connection with the license and agreed to make additional payments to them of up to million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified development milestones and continuing payments based on sales of apoa i milano 
cleviprex recall on december   we conducted a voluntary recall of lots of cleviprex due to the presence of visible particulate matter that was deposited at the bottom of some vials and was observed in such vials during a routine annual inspection 
we are scheduled to extend our voluntary recall in march to include four additional manufactured lots of cleviprex that now also show visible particulate matter that was deposited at the bottom of some vials 
as a result  we are not able to supply the market at this time with existing inventory or using the current manufacturing method 
we are cooperating with the fda and our contract manufacturer on these recalls and to remedy the problem at the manufacturing site 
if the manufacturing problem is remedied  we anticipate being able to supply the market in the second quarter of if the problem is not remedied  we may pursue production of drug product using other approaches  which could delay the supply of cleviprex up to months 
workforce reductions on january  and february   we commenced two separate workforce reductions to improve efficiencies and better align our costs and structure for the future 
as a result of the first workforce reduction  we reduced our office based personnel by employees 
the second workforce reduction resulted in a reduction of primarily field based employees 
we expect to record  in the aggregate  charges of approximately million associated with these workforce reductions  which will be recognized in the first quarter of substantially all of these charges are expected to represent cash expenditures 
we expect to realize estimated annualized cost savings from the workforce reductions in the range of to million starting in the first quarter of

international net revenue increased by million during compared to primarily as a result of direct sales we made after assuming control of the distribution in the european union of angiox in  as well as increased orders from our international distributors 
we assumed control of the distribution of angiox in the majority of the countries in the nycomed territory during the third quarter of and the remainder in the fourth quarter of during  we recognized as revenue from collaborations approximately million of net revenue from angiox sales of approximately million made by nycomed under our transitional distribution agreement with nycomed which terminated on december  under the terms of this transitional distribution agreement  upon the sale by nycomed to third parties of vials of angiox  nycomed paid us a specified percentage of nycomed s net sales of angiox  less the amount previously paid by nycomed to us for the existing inventory 
in july  we reimbursed nycomed million for the final amount of inventory held by nycomed at december  if we are unable to extend the patent term of the principal us patent covering angiomax beyond march  or to maintain our market exclusivity for angiomax in the united states through enforcement of our other us patents covering angiomax  angiomax could be subject to generic competition as early as september  competition from generic equivalents sold at a price that is less than the price at which we currently sell angiomax could reduce our revenues  possibly materially 
if the manufacturing problem related to cleviprex that resulted in our recall and scheduled recall of cleviprex is remedied  we anticipate being able to supply the market with drug product in the second quarter of if the problem is not remedied  we may pursue production of drug product using other approaches  which could delay the supply of cleviprex up to months

table of contents angiomax research and development spending related to angiomax during increased by approximately million compared to  primarily due to an increase in manufacturing development expenses related to product lifecycle management activities 
administrative costs increased million primarily in connection with costs incurred in connection with the regulatory filing related to a clinical study report for the pediatric extension filed with the fda in the second quarter of clinical trial costs increased approximately million primarily due to increased expenditures in connection with our euromax clinical trial  which commenced enrollment on march   which were partially offset by decreased expenditures associated with the investigator initiated trial  horizons ami  that we supported 
during the second quarter of  we incurred million in costs related to the final milestone payment in connection with horizons ami 
we plan to continue to incur research and development expenses relating to angiomax in connection with our efforts to further develop angiomax for use in additional patient populations and our plan to increase our product lifecycle management activities 
cleviprex research and development expenditures for cleviprex decreased approximately million during compared the decrease in research and development expenditures primarily relates to decreased manufacturing development expenses associated with product lifecycle management activities and a decrease in administrative and headcount costs primarily due to a reduction in administrative activity in related to our maa for cleviprex in the european union  which we submitted during the first quarter of these decreases were partially offset by increased clinical trial expenses due to the numerous phase and other clinical studies of cleviprex we are conducting in areas such as intracranial hemorrhage  major cardiovascular surgery  neurocritical care and hypertension associated with congestive heart failure  along with health economics analyses 
cangrelor research and development expenditures related to cangrelor decreased by approximately million in compared to in may  we discontinued enrollment in our phase champion clinical trial program for cangrelor 
manufacturing development expenses and administrative and headcount costs remained relatively unchanged 
subject to the completion of ongoing discussions with the fda  leading experts in ischemic heart disease and astrazeneca  which licensed cangrelor to us  we plan to initiate a new phase clinical trial of cangrelor in oritavancin with our acquisition of targanta in february  we acquired a worldwide exclusive license to oritavancin 
subject to the completion of ongoing discussions with the fda  we expect to commence a phase clinical trial of oritavancin in for the treatment of absssi 
in august  we withdrew the european maa for oritavancin 
costs incurred during the year ended december  primarily relate to phase clinical trials  manufacturing costs and headcount 
the results of targanta s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date 
cu we acquired cu in august in connection with our acquisition of curacyte discovery 
cu is a small molecule serine protease inhibitor that we are developing for the prevention of blood loss during surgery 
the acquisition of curacyte discovery resulted in the inclusion in research and development expense of million of acquisition related in process research and development in costs incurred during primarily relate to a clinical milestone of million that we paid in december  our phase a clinical trial of cu  which we commenced in july  and headcount

we plan to submit an ind for cu to the fda in apoa i milano in december  we paid million in license fees to pfizer and additional payments to other third parties for exclusive worldwide rights to apoa i milano 
argatroban in september  we paid a million technology license fee to eagle for marketing rights for a ready to use formulation of argatroban in the united states and canada 
other spending in this category includes infrastructure costs in support of our product development efforts  which includes expenses for data management  statistical analysis  analysis of pre clinical data  analysis of pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic pk pd data and product safety as well as expenses related to business development activities in connection with our efforts to evaluate early stage and late stage compounds for development and commercialization and other strategic opportunities 
spending in this category decreased by approximately million during compared to  primarily due to a reduction of business development expenses 
our success in further developing angiomax  obtaining marketing approvals for cleviprex outside the united states  and developing and obtaining marketing approval for our products in development  is highly uncertain 
we cannot predict expenses associated with ongoing data analysis or regulatory submissions  if any 
nor can we reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  cleviprex outside the united states  or our products in development due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing and maintaining sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing and maintaining clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights

in addition  we incurred in a total of million of cost related to our acquisitions of targanta and curacyte discovery  of which million transaction cost related to targanta 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in marketing  promotional and support expense reflecting higher spending in related to the cleviprex launch in and a million decrease in stock based compensation expense 
other expense income year ended december  change change in thousands other expense income other expense income  which is comprised of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and impairment of investment  decreased million to million of expense for  from million of income for this decrease was primarily due to a million impairment charge taken with respect to our equity investment in eagle and to lower levels of cash to invest combined with lower rates of return on our available for sale securities in provision for income tax year ended december  change change in thousands provision for income tax we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in and million in  based on losses before income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the increase in the provision for income taxes was driven mainly by our decision to fully reserve against our deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that we will not realize the future benefit of these assets 
although we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  we will continue to evaluate their future realizability on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances 
these would include but are not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  the progress of ongoing tax audits  the regulatory approval of products currently under development  extension of the patent rights relating to angiomax and the ability to achieve future anticipated revenues 
if we reduce the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in future years  we would recognize a tax benefit

as of december   we assumed control of the distribution of angiox in the countries previously serviced by nycomed 
the remaining increase in international net revenue is primarily related to increased orders for angiomax from our canadian distributor 
during  we recognized as revenue from collaborations approximately million of net revenue from sales made by nycomed of approximately million under our transitional distribution agreement with nycomed 
under the terms of this transitional distribution agreement  upon the sale by nycomed to third parties of vials of angiox  nycomed pays us a specified percentage of nycomed s net sales of angiox  less the amount previously paid by nycomed to us for the existing inventory 
during  we recognized as revenue from collaborations approximately million of net revenue from sales of angiox made by nycomed of approximately million under the transitional distribution agreement

research and development spending year ended december  of of research and development total r d total r d in thousands in thousands angiomax clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total angiomax cleviprex clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total cleviprex cangrelor clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total cangrelor cu clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs acquisition related in process research and development total cu other total angiomax research and development spending related to angiomax during decreased by approximately million compared to angiomax clinical trial costs decreased by approximately million primarily due to decreased expenditures in connection with the investigator initiated trial called horizons ami to study angiomax use in adult ami patients that we supported 
during the third quarter of  we incurred million in costs related to the final milestone payment in connection with horizons ami 
the decrease in angiomax clinical trial expenses was also due to decreased expenditures in connection with our  patient phase acuity trial 
in  clinical trial expenses incurred related to our phase acuity trial primarily related to data analysis 
we incurred no clinical trial expense in related to acuity 
clinical trial expenses also decreased during due to reduced research and development expenses that we incurred in connection with a study of angiomax in the pediatric setting that we began in the first half of in connection with a written request by the fda 
we completed the enrollment of patients during the third quarter of and filed a clinical study report for the pediatric extension with the fda in the second quarter of costs incurred in connection with the pediatric study were approximately million less during compared to 
table of contents angiomax manufacturing development expenses during increased million compared to  primarily due to product lifecycle management activities 
administrative and headcount costs decreased in primarily related to our efforts in to seek approval from the fda of an additional indication for angiomax for the treatment of patients with acs based on results of our phase acuity trial 
the fda accepted this application to file in september in may  we received a non approvable letter from the fda 
in its letter  the fda indicated that the basis of its decision involved the appropriate use and interpretation of the non inferiority trials we relied on in support of our snda  including acuity trial 
we disagree with the fda on these issues and continue to evaluate how to respond to the fda s views on the acuity trial cleviprex research and development expenditures for cleviprex decreased approximately million during compared the decrease in research and development expenditures primarily reflected higher spending during in preparation for filing our nda with the fda  which we submitted in july on august   the fda approved cleviprex for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable 
we launched the product in the united states in september cangrelor research and development expenditures related to cangrelor increased by approximately million in compared to as enrollment continued in our two pivotal phase clinical trials for the evaluation of cangrelor s effectiveness and safety in preventing ischemic events in patients who require pci 
research and development spending associated with our champion pci and champion platform trials increased during primarily due to an increase in the number of countries in which we were recruiting patients through contract research organizations for these trials 
in march  we commenced enrollment of our champion pci trial  which we designed to evaluate whether use of intravenous cangrelor is superior to use of clopidrogrel tablets in patients undergoing pci 
we commenced enrollment in october of a second trial  called champion platform  which compares cangrelor plus usual care to placebo plus usual care in patients who require pci 
as of december   we had enrolled approximately  patients in our champion pci trial and approximately  patients in our champion platform trial 
cu in august  we acquired curacyte discovery 
we allocated approximately million of the purchase price for the acquisition to in process research and development and expensed it during the third quarter of other spending in this category consists of infrastructure costs in support of our product development efforts  which includes expenses for data management  statistical analysis  analysis of pre clinical data  analysis of pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic pk pd data and product safety as well as expenses related to business development activities 
we also incur business development expenses in connection with our efforts to evaluate early stage and late stage compounds for development and commercialization and other strategic opportunities 
in  spending in this category increased by million compared to the same period in  primarily related to an increase in business development activities and increased headcount in our business development department 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  change change in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million includes million of expenses incurred in preparation for the launch of cleviprex  a million increase in expenses relating to marketing of angiomax  million in fees related to the building of our business infrastructure in europe  a million increase in costs related to headcount expansion  including the expansion of medical science  sales management and international operations teams and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was partially offset by the million of expenses incurred during the third quarter of related to the termination of the prior distribution agreement with nycomed and our reacquisition of all the rights to develop  distribute and market angiox in the nycomed territory that we recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses in other income year ended december  change change in thousands other income other income  which is comprised of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  decreased million to million for  from million for approximately million of the decrease in other income related to a decrease in interest income due to lower rates of return on our available for sale securities in the remaining decrease in other income related to losses on foreign currency transactions 
provision for income tax year ended december  change change in thousands provision for income tax we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in and million in based on losses before income taxes of million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for income taxes in was attributable to the increase in foreign losses 
we did not record a deferred tax benefit in or as we believed that the realization of the deferred tax assets associated with those losses was not more likely than not 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of common stock  sales of convertible promissory notes and warrants  interest income and revenues from sales of angiomax 
except for and  we have incurred losses on an annual basis since our inception 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  cash flows as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  our primary sources of cash during included million of net cash provided by operating activities and million in net cash provided by financing activities 
these amounts were exceeded by the million in net cash that we used in investing activities 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the cash provided by operating activities in included a net loss of million  offset by non cash items of million consisting primarily of a deferred tax provision of million  stock based compensation expense of million and impairment of investment of million 
cash provided by operating activities in also included a decrease of million due to changes in working capital items 
the cash provided by operating activities in includes a decrease in cash flow from operations of million due to a net loss in  offset by non cash items of million consisting of in process research and development charge of million in connection with the curacyte discovery acquisition  stock based compensation expense of million and deferred tax provision of million

we received million in  million in and million in  respectively  in net cash provided by financing activities  which consisted of proceeds to us from option exercises and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
funding requirements we expect to devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts and to our sales  marketing and manufacturing programs associated with angiomax  cleviprex and our products in development 
our funding requirements to support these efforts and programs depend upon many factors  including the extent to which angiomax is commercially successful globally  the outcome of our efforts to extend the patent term of the principal us patent covering angiomax and the degree of market exclusivity in the united states provided by our other us patents covering angiomax  the terms of any settlements with biogen idec or the two law firms with respect to the principal us patent covering angiomax and the pto s denial of our application to extend the term of the patent  our ability to resupply the market with cleviprex and the extent to which cleviprex is commercially successful in the united states  the extent to which we can successfully establish a commercial infrastructure outside the united states  the cost of acquisitions or licensing of development stage products  approved products  or businesses and strategic or licensing arrangements with companies that fit within our growth strategy  the progress  level  timing and cost of our research and development activities related to our clinical trials and non clinical studies with respect to angiomax  cleviprex and our products in development  the cost and outcomes of regulatory submissions and reviews for approval of cleviprex outside the united states and new zealand and of our products in development globally  the continuation or termination of third party manufacturing and sales and marketing arrangements  the size  cost and effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs globally  
table of contents the amounts of our payment obligations to third parties as to angiomax  cleviprex and our products in development  and our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated sales of angiomax and cleviprex  or higher than anticipated costs globally  if we acquire additional product candidates or businesses  or if we determine that raising additional capital would be in our interest and the interests of our stockholders  we may sell equity or debt securities or seek additional financing through other arrangements 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders  and debt financing may involve covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
we cannot be certain that public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we seek to raise funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties  we may be required to relinquish rights to products  product candidates or technologies that we would not otherwise relinquish or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
certain contingencies as we have previously disclosed  the us patent and trademark office  or pto  rejected the application under the hatch waxman act for an extension of the term of us patent no 
 or the patent  the principal us patent that covers angiomax  beyond march  because in its view the application was not timely filed 
we refer to such application herein as the patent extension filing 
we have entered into agreements with the law firms involved in the patent extension filing that suspend the statute of limitations on any claims against them for failing to make a timely filing 
we have entered into a similar agreement with biogen idec  one of our licensors for angiomax  relating to any claims  including claims for damages and or license termination  that biogen idec may bring relating to the patent extension filing 
such claims by biogen idec could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or business 
in the third quarter of  we initiated discussions  which are still ongoing  with the law firms involved in the patent extension filing of the application and are currently in related discussions with biogen idec and hri with respect to the possible resolution of potential claims among the parties 
contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
these include commitments related to purchases of inventory of our products  research and development service agreements  operating leases  selling  general and administrative obligations  increases to our restricted cash in connection with our lease of our principal office space in parsippany  new jersey and royalty and milestone payments due under our license agreements 
future estimated contractual obligations as of december  are less than more than contractual obligations in thousands total year years years years inventory related commitments research and development operating leases selling  general and administrative unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations all of the inventory related commitments included above are non cancellable 
included within the inventory related commitments above are purchase commitments to lonza braine totaling million for and million for for angiomax bulk drug substance 
of the total estimated contractual obligations for research and development and selling  general and administrative activities  million is non cancellable 
in january  we moved our principal offices to a new office building in parsippany  new jersey 
the lease covering the new office building covers  square feet and expires january in connection with the move  we vacated our previous office space in parsippany 
the lease for our old office facility expires january in the second half of  we sublet our old office space to two companies 
the first sublease  for the second floor of our old office space  expires in march  subject to renewal by 
table of contents the subtenant for up to three periods of six months each and thereafter for one period of four months  and the second sublease  covering the first floor of our previous office space  expires in january additionally  certain other costs such as leasing commissions and legal fees will be expensed as incurred in conjunction with the sublease of the vacated office space 
approximately of the total operating lease commitments above relate to our new office building 
also included in total operating lease commitments are automobile leases  computer leases  the operating lease from our previous office space and other property leases that we entered into while expanding our european infrastructure 
in addition  we lease offices in waltham  massachusetts  milton park  abingdon  united kingdom  zurich  switzerland  paris  france  rome italy  munich  germany  leipzig  germany  and montreal  canada 
aggregate rent expense for these offices was approximately million in  million in and million in in addition to the amounts shown in the above table  we are contractually obligated to make potential future success based development  regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments in conjunction with collaborative agreements or acquisitions we have entered into with third parties 
these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and  given the nature of these events  it is unclear when  if ever  we may be required to pay such amounts 
these contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
further  the timing of any future payment is not reasonable estimable 
as such  obligations related to the acquisition of targanta which occurred in february  including contingent cash payments up to approximately million that would be owed to former targanta shareholders under our merger agreement with targanta  are not included in the above 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the revised authoritative guidance on business combinations which changed existing practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements are now fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs are now expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  reversal of valuation allowances created in purchase accounting are now recorded through the income tax provision  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  all authoritative guidance would have to be met at the acquisition date 
we accounted for the targanta acquisition under this revised authoritative guidance  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb staff position no 
fas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which was later superseded by the fasb accounting standards codification  or asc  also known collectively as the fasb codification  and included in asc topic which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
this guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we adopted this accounting pronouncement as of and for the period ended june  and this adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which was later superseded by the fasb codification and included in asc topic  which amends the other than temporary impairment guidance in gaap for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we adopted this accounting pronouncement as of and for the period ended june  and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 subsequent events  which was later superseded by the fasb codification and included in asc topic  or asc asc is intended to establish general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
asc requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for selecting that date  including whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
asc is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  we adopted this accounting pronouncement as of and for the period ended june  and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which was later superseded by the fasb codification and included in asc topic  or asc  which modifies how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
asc clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
asc requires an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
asc also requires additional disclosures about a company s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is effective for us on january  we do not expect that the adoption of asc will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of fasb statement no 
this statement modifies the gaap hierarchy by establishing only two levels of gaap  authoritative and nonauthoritative accounting literature 
effective july  the fasb codification is considered the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards  except for additional authoritative rules and interpretive releases issued by the sec 
nonauthoritative guidance and literature would include  among other things  fasb concepts statements  american institute of certified public accountants issue papers and technical practice aids and accounting textbooks 
the fasb codification was developed to organize gaap pronouncements by topic so that users can more easily access authoritative accounting guidance 
it is organized by topic  subtopic  section  and paragraph  each of which is identified by a numerical designation 
this statement applied beginning in third quarter all accounting references have been updated  and therefore sfas references have been replaced with asc references 
in august  the fasb issued the fasb codification update no 
fair value measurements and disclosures 
the update is to subtopic asc  fair value measurements and disclosures overall  for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
the purpose of this update is to reduce ambiguity in financial reporting when measuring fair value of liabilities 
the guidance in the update was effective for us during the three months ending september  and did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
application of critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition  inventory  stock based compensation and income taxes described below are critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition product sales 
we distribute angiomax and cleviprex in the united states through a sole source distribution model 
under this model  we sell angiomax and cleviprex to our sole source distributor  ics  which then sells angiomax and cleviprex to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the united states and in certain cases  directly to hospitals 
our agreement with ics  which we initially entered into february  provides that ics will be our exclusive distributor of angiomax and cleviprex in the united states 
under the terms of this fee for service agreement  ics 
table of contents assumes all credit and inventory risks  is subject to our standard return policy  places orders with us for sufficient quantities of angiomax and cleviprex to maintain an appropriate level of inventory based on our customers historical purchase volumes and has sole responsibility for determining the prices at which it sells angiomax and cleviprex  subject to specified limitations in the agreement 
the agreement terminates on february   but will automatically renew for additional one year periods unless either party gives notice at least days prior to the automatic extension 
we may also terminate the agreement at any time and for any reason upon prior written notice to ics and payment of a termination fee of between  and outside of the united states  we sell angiomax either directly to hospitals or to wholesalers or international distributors  which then sell angiomax to hospitals 
we had deferred revenue of million as of december  and december  associated with sales of angiomax to wholesalers outside of the united states 
we recognize revenue from such sales when hospitals purchase the product 
we do not recognize revenue from product sales until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  we have no obligation to bring about the sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
we began selling cleviprex in the united states in september initial gross wholesaler orders of cleviprex in the united states in the third quarter of totaled million 
we recorded this amount as deferred revenue as we could not estimate certain adjustments to gross revenue  including returns 
under this deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue upon product shipment to ics 
instead  upon product shipment  we invoice ics  record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  classify the cost basis of the product held by ics as finished goods inventory held by others and include such cost basis amount within prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
we currently recognize the deferred revenue when hospitals purchase product and will do so until such time that we have sufficient information to develop reasonable estimates of expected returns and other adjustments to gross revenue 
when such estimates are developed  we expect to recognize cleviprex revenue upon shipment to ics in the same manner as we recognize angiomax revenue 
during the third quarter of  we reduced our contract price for cleviprex  which had the effect of reducing the deferred revenue by approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced a voluntary recall of lots of cleviprex  including any remaining unsold inventory associated with its initial wholesaler orders which resulted in a reduction of deferred revenue of approximately million 
we recognized million of revenue associated with cleviprex during related to purchases by hospitals 
we record allowances for chargebacks and other discounts or accruals for product returns  rebates and fee for service charges at the time of sale  and reports revenue net of such amounts 
in determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
for example  in determining these amounts  we estimate hospital demand  buying patterns by hospitals and group purchasing organizations from wholesalers and the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and by ics 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past wholesaler and hospital buying patterns will predict future product sales 
we receive data periodically from ics and wholesalers on inventory levels and levels of hospital purchases and we consider this data in determining the amounts of these allowances and accruals 
the nature of our allowances and accruals requiring critical estimates  and the specific considerations we use in estimating our amounts are as follows 
product returns 
our customers have the right to return any unopened product during the month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending months after the labeled expiration date 
as a result  in calculating the accrual for product returns  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold might not be used within six months of expiration and analyze the likelihood that such product will be returned within months after expiration 
we consider all of these factors and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience 
when customers return product  they are generally given credit against amounts owed 
the amount credited is charged to our product returns accrual 
in estimating the likelihood of product being returned  we rely on information from ics and wholesalers regarding inventory levels  measured hospital demand as reported by third party sources and internal sales data 
we also consider the past buying patterns of ics and wholesalers  the estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped  the expiration dates of product currently being shipped  price changes of competitive products and introductions of generic products 
at december  and december   our accrual for product returns was million and million  respectively 
included within the accrual at december  was a reserve of million that we established related to the cleviprex 
table of contents product recall which occurred in december included within the accrual at december  was a reserve of million that we established for existing inventory at nycomed that nycomed had the right to return at any time 
in july  we reimbursed nycomed million for the final amount of inventory held by nycomed at december  a change in our accrual for product returns would have had an approximate million effect on our reported net revenue for the year ended december  chargebacks and rebates 
although we primarily sell products to ics in the united states  we typically enter into agreements with hospitals  either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members  in connection with the hospitals purchases of products 
based on these agreements  most of our hospital customers have the right to receive a discounted price for products and volume based rebates on product purchases 
in the case of discounted pricing  we typically provide a credit to ics  or a chargeback  representing the difference between ics s acquisition list price and the discounted price 
in the case of the volume based rebates  we typically pay the rebate directly to the hospitals 
as a result of these agreements  at the time of product shipment  we estimate the likelihood that product sold to ics might be ultimately sold to a contracting hospital or group purchasing organization 
we also estimate the contracting hospital s or group purchasing organization s volume of purchases 
we base our estimates on industry data  hospital purchases and the historic chargeback data we receive from ics  most of which ics receives from wholesalers  which detail historic buying patterns and sales mix for particular hospitals and group purchasing organizations  and the applicable customer chargeback rates and rebate thresholds 
our allowance for chargebacks was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our allowance for chargebacks would have had an approximate million effect on our reported net revenue for the year ended december  our accrual for rebates was million at december  and million at december  fees for service 
we offer discounts to certain wholesalers and ics based on contractually determined rates for certain services 
we estimate our fee for service accruals and allowances based on historical sales  wholesaler and distributor inventory levels and the applicable discount rate 
our discounts are accrued at the time of the sale and are typically settled with the wholesalers or ics within days after the end of each respective quarter 
our fee for service accruals and allowances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our fee for service accruals and allowances would have had an approximate million effect on our net revenue for the year ended december  we have adjusted our allowances for chargebacks and accruals for product returns  rebates and fees for service in the past based on actual sales experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances and accruals in the future 
we continually monitor our allowances and accruals and makes adjustments when we believe actual experience may differ from our estimates 
the allowances included in the table below reflect these adjustments 
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals during  and amounts in thousands fees for returns chargebacks rebates service balance at january  allowances for sales during allowances for prior year sales allowances for sales in nycomed territory actual credits issued for prior year s sales actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  allowances for sales during allowances for prior year sales allowances for sales in nycomed territory actual credits issued for prior year s sales actual credits issued for prior year s sales in nycomed territory actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  allowances for sales during allowances for prior year sales actual credits issued for prior year s sales actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  
table of contents included within the allowances above is the reserve of million that we recorded during the fourth quarter of for the existing inventory at nycomed which we did not believe would be sold prior to the termination of our transitional distribution agreement with nycomed and would be subject to purchase in accordance with the agreement 
during  we reduced the reserve by million as nycomed sold a portion of the existing inventory during the year 
such amount is included within the allowances above 
in  we reimbursed nycomed million for the final amount of inventory held by nycomed at december  international distributors 
under our agreements with our primary international distributors  we sell angiomax to these distributors at a fixed price 
the established price is typically determined once per year  prior to the first shipment of angiomax to the distributor each year 
the minimum selling price used in determining the price is of the average net unit selling price 
revenue from the sale of products during includes the amortization of milestone payments 
these milestone payments are recorded as deferred revenue until contractual performance obligations have been satisfied  and they are typically recognized ratably over the term of these agreements 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we must estimate the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we review these estimates at least annually  which could result in a change in the deferral period 
in connection with the nycomed transaction described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we wrote off approximately million of deferred revenue during the third quarter of  which amount represented the unamortized portion of deferred revenue related to milestone payments received from nycomed in and revenue associated with sales to our international distributors during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
during  international net revenue was reduced by million  which represented a reserve for existing inventory at nycomed because we did not believe that such inventory would be sold by nycomed prior to the termination of our transitional distribution agreement with nycomed and because such inventory was subject to return 
during  we reduced the nycomed inventory reserve by million as nycomed sold a portion of our existing inventory during the year 
such amounts are included in the million of revenue associated with sales to our international distributors during as a result  we reduced our reserve for existing inventory to million  which resulted in an increase to international net revenue 
we reimbursed nycomed million in july for the final amount of inventory held by nycomed at december  revenue from collaborations 
under the terms of the transitional distribution agreement with nycomed  we were entitled to receive a specified percentage of nycomed s net sales of angiox to third parties 
in the event the angiox sold was purchased by nycomed from us prior to july   the amount we were entitled to receive in connection with such sale was reduced by the amount previously paid by nycomed to us for such product 
accordingly  revenue related to the transitional distribution agreement with nycomed entered into in  under which nycomed provided product distribution services through the second half of  was not recognized until the product was sold by nycomed to a hospital customer 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of net revenue from sales made by nycomed of approximately million under the transitional distribution agreement 
we recorded such amount as revenue from collaborations and included it in net revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
because we assumed control of the distribution of angiox in all countries in the nycomed territory by december   we did not have any revenue from collaborations during the year ended december  inventory we record inventory upon the transfer of title from our vendors 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value and valued using first in  first out methodology 
angiomax and cleviprex bulk substance is classified as raw materials and its costs are determined using acquisition costs from our contract manufacturers 
we record work in progress costs of filling  finishing and packaging against specific product batches 
we obtain all of our angiomax bulk drug substance from lonza braine  sa under the terms of our agreement with lonza braine  we provide forecasts of our annual needs for angiomax bulk substance months in 
table of contents advance 
we also have a separate agreement with ben venue laboratories  inc for the fill finish of angiomax drug product 
we obtain all of our cleviprex bulk drug substance from johnson matthey pharma services and also have a separate agreement with hospira  inc for the fill finish of cleviprex drug product 
we review inventory  including inventory purchase commitments  for slow moving or obsolete amounts based on expected revenues 
as of december   we had an inventory obsolescence reserve of million related to cleviprex 
as of december   the obsolescence reserve related to cleviprex was reduced to zero 
if annual revenues are less than expected  we may be required to make additional allowances for excess or obsolete inventory in the future 
stock based compensation we have established equity compensation plans for our employees  directors and certain other individuals 
all grants and terms are authorized by our board of directors or the compensation committee of our board of directors  as appropriate 
we may grant non qualified stock options  restricted stock awards  stock appreciation rights and other stock based awards under our amended restated stock incentive plan 
from january to may  we granted non qualified stock options under our equity inducement plan to new employees as an inducement to their entering into employment with us 
we currently grant non qualified stock options under our equity inducement plan  which was adopted in april  to new employees as an inducement to their entering into employment with us 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
revised share based payment  which was later superseded by the fasb codification and included in asc topic  or asc  and recognizes expense using the accelerated expense attribution method 
asc requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of all share based awards granted to employees 
we estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form option pricing model based on assumptions for the expected term of the stock options  expected volatility of our common stock  and prevailing interest rates 
asc also requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to only recognizing forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur 
we have based our assumptions on the following assumption method of estimating estimated expected term of options employees historical exercise experience and  at times  estimates of future exercises of unexercised options based on the midpoint between the vesting date and end of the contractual term expected volatility historical price of our common stock and the implied volatility of the stock of our peer group risk free interest rate yields of us treasury securities corresponding with the expected life of option grants forfeiture rates historical forfeiture data of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of the employees and expected performance of our common stock 
increases in the term and the volatility of our common stock will generally cause an increase in compensation expense 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on pre tax earnings adjusted for differences between gaap and income tax accounting  existing statutory tax rates  limitations on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in accordance with asc  we use a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
table of contents processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement we measure a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in our financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position 
settlement of filing positions that may be challenged by tax authorities could impact the income tax position in the year of resolution 
our current tax liability is included within accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  tax planning strategies and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   we provided for a full valuation allowance of million 
in determining this valuation allowance  we evaluated and considered such positive and negative evidence as positive our deferred tax assets primarily relate to us net operating losses  the oldest of which will not expire until  our second product  cleviprex  was approved for sale in the united states  we expect it to generate revenue well past the term of the principal us patent covering angiomax  while unsettled  if legislative actions in congress provide the pto with discretion to consider patent extension applications filed late unintentionally under the hatch waxman act  we expect future operations and profit levels during the period of angiomax exclusivity to be positively impacted  negative since inception  except for and  we have incurred net losses on an annual basis  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  for the most recent three years  our cumulative us net loss before taxes totaled approximately million  our primary revenue generating product  angiomax  may face generic competition with the expiration of its market exclusivity as early as september   we are currently involved in patent infringement litigation with three companies  as a result  our future operations and profitability are highly uncertain 
based on this evaluation and consideration of positive and negative evidence  we determined that the weight of the evidence required a million valuation allowance to fully reserve against our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million income tax expense to increase our valuation allowance to million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates  equity prices  creditworthiness  financing  exchange rates or other factors 
our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  corporate debt securities  asset backed securities and us government agency notes with maturities of less than 
table of contents two years  which we believe are subject to limited interest rate and credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
at december  we held million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities which had an average interest rate of approximately 
a basis point change in such average interest rate would have had an approximate million impact on our interest income 
of million  approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities were due on demand or within one year and had an average interest rate of approximately of 
the remaining million were due within two years and had an average interest rate of approximately 
most of our transactions are conducted in us dollars 
we do have certain agreements with parties located outside the united states 
transactions under certain of these agreements are conducted in us dollars  subject to adjustment based on significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
transactions under certain other of these agreements are conducted in the local foreign currency 
as of december   we had receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
a change would have had an approximate million impact on our other income and cash
