liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview operating activities cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared with million in this decrease was primarily driven by less cash received from customers  dealers and service providers than in this decrease in cash receipts was attributable to higher outstanding accounts receivable balances at december   related to our increased commissions on wireless sales 
we collected a significant portion of these receivables in early the decrease in cash received from customers  dealers and service providers was partially offset by less cash paid to suppliers and employees than in  this was primarily attributable to our continued focus on managing our inventory and accounts payable balances 
we also received less interest on our cash balance and paid more interest on our long term debt than in investing activities cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease from was primarily the result of million in cash paid in for our acquisition of radioshack de mexico

we believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities  which was million in  million in  and million in we do not intend for the presentation of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  nor do we intend to imply that free cash flow represents cash flow available for discretionary expenditures 
the following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow

if downgrades occur  which we do not expect  they will adversely affect our future borrowing costs  access to debt capital markets  vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs 
cash requirements capital expenditures we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for will range from million to million 
us radioshack company operated store remodels and relocations  as well as information systems projects  will account for the majority of our anticipated capital expenditures 
cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities will be used to fund future capital expenditure needs 
seasonal inventory buildup typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory buildup range between million and million 
the funding required for this buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill  and stock based compensation 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition description our revenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephone handsets  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
the third party service provider pays us an upfront commission for obtaining a new customer and  in some cases  a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
our sale of an activated wireless telephone handset is the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfront commission and the residual revenue 
upfront commission revenue  net of estimated service deactivations  is generally recognized at the time an activated wireless telephone handset is sold to the customer at the point of sale 
recurring residual income is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the service provider  which is typically as the service provider bills its customer  generally on a monthly basis 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to estimate future sales returns and service plan deactivations 
these estimates are subject to management judgment 
our estimate for product refunds and returns  service plan deactivations  residual revenue and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
based on our extensive history in selling activated wireless telephone handsets  we have been able to establish reliable deactivation estimates 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate sales returns or service deactivations during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions for these items 
however  if actual results differ from our estimates due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million in inventory valuation description our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost which approximates fifo or market 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the location where it is offered for sale 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  technological obsolescence  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the estimated market value  calculated as the amount we expect to realize  net of estimated selling costs  from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory  is determined to be less than the recorded cost  we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate our inventory valuation reserves 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory valuation reserves 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances description the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that result in liability in excess of the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
our accounting for tax estimates and contingencies requires us to evaluate tax issues and establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
our accounting for legal contingencies requires us to estimate the probable losses in these matters 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside legal counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our liabilities for insurance  tax and legal contingencies contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with these items 
we use our history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially affect our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate our insurance reserves during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions for these items 
however  a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million 
as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
additionally  for claims that exceed our deductible amount  we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries  since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant 
although we believe that our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill description long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as negative cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
the carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
we estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset 
our policy is to evaluate long lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations 
we have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets related to business acquisitions 
the original valuation of these intangible assets is based on estimates of future profitability  cash flows and other judgmental factors 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we review our goodwill and other intangible asset balances on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset might exceed their fair value 
if the carrying amount of an intagible asset or a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we recognize an impairment loss for this difference 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our impairment loss calculations for long lived assets contain uncertainties because they require us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives and assumptions about market performance 
we also apply judgment in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our current business model 
our impairment loss calculations for intangible assets and goodwill contain uncertainties because they require us to estimate fair values related to these assets 
we estimate fair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and other comparable market analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and other factors 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies we use to assess impairment loss for long lived assets  intangible assets  or goodwill during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in calculating these impairment losses 
however  if actual results or performance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges  which could be material to our results of operations 
the total value of our goodwill and intangible assets at december   was million 
of this amount  million related to goodwill from the purchase of radioshack de mexico 
based on our most recent review of goodwill impairment  we noted that the fair values of our reporting units were substantially greater than their carrying values 
stock based compensation description we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock and deferred stock units 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock based incentive plans for a more complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
at the date an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the award vests 
the restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a lattice model with monte carlo simulations 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate the black scholes merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected option life  volatility of stock prices  and employee forfeiture rate 
we use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and employee forfeiture rate  and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies used to record stock based compensation during the past three years 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
additionally  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods 
a change in our stock based compensation expense in would have affected our net income by approximately million 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in md a and in other parts of this report include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  intend  potential or similar words 
these matters include statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the only derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks were interest rate swaps  which serve as an economic hedge on our long term debt 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
refer to note derivative financial instruments in notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional information 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at december   of million  consisting of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of our interest rate swaps  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure would result in a change in annual net interest expense of million and an approximate million change to the fair value of our interest rate swaps  which would also affect net interest expense 
this hypothesis assumes no change in the principal or investment balance 
we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our purchase of inventory from manufacturers located in china and other areas outside of the us our purchases are denominated in us dollars  however  the strengthening of the chinese currency  or other currencies  against the us dollar could cause our vendors to increase the prices of items we purchase from them 
it is not possible to estimate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our purchases of this inventory 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to our mexican subsidiary  which represented less than of consolidated net sales and operating revenues in
