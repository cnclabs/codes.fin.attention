item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations legislation and regulation 
the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
the industry is facing increased pressure from anti smoking groups and continued smoking and health litigation  including private class action litigation and health care cost recovery actions brought by governmental entities and other third parties  the effects of which  at this time  we are unable to evaluate 
as of december   there were approximately  individual suits  seven purported class actions or actions where class certification has been sought and four health care cost recovery actions pending in the united states in which liggett was a named defendant 
see item legal proceedings and note to our consolidated financial statements  which contain a description of litigation 
it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any smoking related litigation or as a result of additional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising or labeling of tobacco products 
liggett s management believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the laws regulating cigarette manufacturers 
the master settlement agreement and other state settlement agreements in march  march and march  liggett entered into settlements of tobacco related litigation with states and territories 
the settlements released liggett from all tobacco related claims within those states and territories  including claims for health care cost reimbursement and claims concerning sales of cigarettes to minors 
in november  philip morris  brown williamson  rj reynolds and lorillard the original participating manufacturers or opms and liggett together with any other tobacco product manufacturer that becomes a signatory  the subsequent participating manufacturers or spms  the opms and spms are hereinafter referred to jointly as the participating manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement with states  the district of columbia  puerto rico  guam  the united states virgin islands  american samoa and the northern mariana islands collectively  the settling states to settle the asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims of those settling states 
the master settlement agreement received final judicial approval in each settling state 

table of contents in the settling states  the master settlement agreement released liggett from all claims of the settling states and their respective political subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds  relating to i past conduct arising out of the use  sale  distribution  manufacture  development  advertising and marketing of tobacco products  ii the health effects of  the exposure to  or research  statements or warnings about  tobacco products  and all monetary claims of the settling states and their respective subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds  relating to future conduct arising out of the use of or exposure to  tobacco products that have been manufactured in the ordinary course of business 
the master settlement agreement restricts tobacco product advertising and marketing within the settling states and otherwise restricts the activities of participating manufacturers 
among other things  the master settlement agreement prohibits the targeting of youth in the advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products  bans the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion  limits each participating manufacturer to one tobacco brand name sponsorship during any month period  bans all outdoor advertising  with certain limited exceptions  prohibits payments for tobacco product placement in various media  bans gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended recipient is an adult  prohibits participating manufacturers from licensing third parties to advertise tobacco brand names in any manner prohibited under the master settlement agreement  and prohibits participating manufacturers from using as a tobacco product brand name any nationally recognized non tobacco brand or trade name or the names of sports teams  entertainment groups or individual celebrities 
the master settlement agreement also requires participating manufacturers to affirm corporate principles to comply with the master settlement agreement and to reduce underage usage of tobacco products and imposes restrictions on lobbying activities conducted on behalf of participating manufacturers 
liggett has no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
vector tobacco has no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement  except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
according to data from management science associates  inc  domestic shipments by liggett and vector tobacco accounted for approximately of the total cigarettes shipped in the united states during  during  and during if liggett s or vector tobacco s market share exceeds their respective market share exemption in a given year  then on april of the following year  liggett and or vector tobacco  as the case may be  would pay on each excess unit an amount equal on a per unit basis to that due by the opms for that year 
liggett and vector tobacco paid approximately million for their master settlement agreement obligation 
liggett and vector tobacco paid approximately million for their master settlement agreement obligation 
liggett and vector tobacco paid approximately million for their master settlement obligation 
additional amounts may be due for but will not be determined by the independent auditor until april under the payment provisions of the master settlement agreement  the participating manufacturers are required to pay a base amount of billion in and each year thereafter subject to applicable adjustments  offsets and reductions 
these annual payments are allocated based on unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
the payment obligations under the master settlement agreement are the several  and not joint  obligations of each participating manufacturer and are not the responsibility of any parent or affiliate of a participating manufacturer 
liggett may have additional payment obligations under the master settlement agreement and its other settlement agreements with the states

in the brokerage company s traditional business of residential real estate sales and marketing  it competes primarily with multi office independent real estate organizations and  to some extent  with franchise real estate organizations  such as century  era  re max and coldwell banker 
the company believes that its major competitors in will also increasingly include multi office real estate organizations  such as gmac home services  nrt inc whose affiliates include the new york city based corcoran group and other privately owned companies 
residential brokerage firms compete for sales and marketing business primarily on the basis of services offered  reputation  personal contacts  and  recently to a greater degree  price

however  prudential douglas elliman real estate does not believe that compliance with environmental  zoning and land use laws and regulations has had  or will have  a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or operations 
in de capital s mortgage business  mortgage loan origination and funding activities are subject to the equal credit opportunity act  the federal truth in lending act  the real estate settlement procedures act  and the regulations promulgated thereunder which prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain information to borrowers concerning credit and settlement costs

risk factors our business faces many risks 
we have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face 
there may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries 
each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition or equity of us or one or more of our subsidiaries  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports that we may file with the securities and exchange commission or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us 
we have significant liquidity commitments during  we have certain liquidity commitments that could require the use of our existing cash resources 
as of december   our corporate expenditures exclusive of liggett  vector tobacco and new valley and other potential liquidity requirements over the next months included the following cash interest expense of approximately million  dividends on our outstanding common shares currently at an annual rate of approximately million  and other corporate expenses and taxes 
in order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other liquidity needs in the normal course of business  we will be required to use cash flows from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents 
should these resources be insufficient to meet the upcoming liquidity needs  we may also be required to liquidate investment securities available for sale and other long term investments  or  if available  draw on liggett s credit facility 
while there are actions we can take to reduce our liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that such measures can be achieved 
we and our subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
we and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations 
at december   we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness including the embedded derivative liabilities related to our convertible notes of million 
we must redeem million of our variable interest senior convertible 
table of contents debentures by june  and may be required to purchase million of the debentures on june  approximately million of our convertible notes mature in and million of our senior secured notes matures in in addition  subject to the terms of any future agreements  we and our subsidiaries will be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
there is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt 
if we cannot service our fixed charges  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we are a holding company and depend on cash payments from our subsidiaries  which are subject to contractual and other restrictions  in order to service our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock 
we are a holding company and have no operations of our own 
we hold our interests in our various businesses through our wholly owned subsidiaries  vgr holding and new valley 
in addition to our own cash resources  our ability to pay interest on our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock depends on the ability of vgr holding and new valley to make cash available to us 
vgr holding s ability to pay dividends to us depends primarily on the ability of liggett  its wholly owned subsidiary  to generate cash and make it available to vgr holding 
liggett s revolving credit agreement with wachovia bank  na contains a restricted payments test that limits the ability of liggett to pay cash dividends to vgr holding 
the ability of liggett to meet the restricted payments test may be affected by factors beyond its control  including wachovia s unilateral discretion  if acting in good faith  to modify elements of such test 
our receipt of cash payments  as dividends or otherwise  from our subsidiaries is an important source of our liquidity and capital resources 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources of our own and do not receive payments from our subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to repay our debts and to pay dividends on our common stock  we must obtain additional funds from other sources 
there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain additional funds at all or on terms acceptable to us 
our inability to service these obligations and to continue to pay dividends on our common stock would significantly harm us and the value of our common stock 
our senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility 
the indenture governing our senior secured notes due contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to take specific actions  even if we believe them to be in our best interest  including restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  pay dividends or distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  create liens with respect to our assets  make investments  loans or advances  prepay subordinated indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  and merge  consolidate  reorganize or sell our assets 
in addition  liggett s revolving credit agreement requires us to meet specified financial ratios 
these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the liggett revolving credit agreement may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance  changes in general business and economic conditions  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants  including those contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the liggett s credit agreement  could result in a default under our indebtedness  which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable 
if any of our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay it 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  restrict our ability to pay certain dividends or make other restricted payments or enter into transactions with

liggett faces intense competition in the domestic tobacco industry 
liggett is considerably smaller and has fewer resources than its major competitors  and  as a result  has a more limited ability to respond to market developments 
management science associates data indicate that the three largest cigarette manufacturers controlled approximately of the united states cigarette market during philip morris is the largest and most profitable manufacturer in the market  and its profits are derived principally from its sale of premium cigarettes 
philip morris had approximately of the premium segment and of the total domestic market during during  all of liggett s sales were in the discount segment  and its share of the total domestic cigarette market was 
philip morris and rjr tobacco which is now part of reynolds american  the two largest cigarette manufacturers  have historically  because of their dominant market share  been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry 
market pressures have historically caused the other cigarette manufacturers to bring their prices into line with the levels established by these two major manufacturers 
philip morris and reynolds american dominate the domestic cigarette market and had a combined market share of approximately at december  this concentration of united states market share could make it more difficult for liggett and vector tobacco to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition in the market  either of which could have a material adverse affect on their sales volume  operating income and cash flows  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett s business is highly dependent on the discount cigarette segment 
liggett depends more on sales in the discount cigarette segment of the market  relative to the full price premium segment  than its major competitors 
all of liggett s unit volume in and was generated in the discount segment 
the discount segment is highly competitive  with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price 
while the three major manufacturers all compete with liggett in the discount segment of the market  the strongest competition for market share has recently come from a group of smaller manufacturers and importers  most of which sell low quality  deep discount cigarettes 
while liggett s share of the discount market was in and  a decrease from in  management science associates data indicate that the discount market share of these other smaller manufacturers and importers was approximately in  in and in if pricing in the discount market continues to be impacted by these smaller manufacturers and importers  margins in liggett s only current market segment could be negatively affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett s market share is susceptible to decline 
in years prior to  liggett suffered a substantial decline in unit sales and associated market share 
liggett s unit sales and market share increased during each of  and  and its market share increased in while its unit sales declined 
liggett s market share  which did not change in  increased compared to the prior years in    and this earlier market share erosion resulted in part from liggett s highly leveraged capital structure that existed until december and its limited ability to match other competitors wholesale and retail trade programs  obtain retail shelf space for its products and advertise its brands 
these declines also resulted from adverse developments in the tobacco industry  intense competition and changes in consumer preferences 
according to management science associates data  liggett s overall domestic market share during was compared to during and liggett s share of the discount segment was during and  down from in if liggett s market share declines  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 

table of contents the domestic cigarette industry has experienced declining unit sales in recent periods 
industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states have been generally declining for a number of years  with management science associates data indicating that domestic industry wide shipments decreased by approximately in as compared to  and by approximately in as compared to we believe that industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states will generally continue to decline as a result of numerous factors 
these factors include health considerations  diminishing social acceptance of smoking  and a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limiting smoking in restaurants  bars and other public places  as well as increases in federal and state excise taxes and settlement related expenses which have contributed to high cigarette price levels in recent years 
if this decline in industry wide shipments continues and liggett is unable to capture market share from its competitors  or if the industry as a whole is unable to offset the decline in unit sales with price increases  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett s cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing regulation and taxation  which has a negative effect on revenue and profitability 
tobacco products are subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes in the united states 
on february   president obama signed an increase of in the federal excise tax per pack of cigarettes  for a total of per pack of cigarettes  and significant tax increases on other tobacco products  to fund expansion of the state children s health insurance program  referred to as the schip 
these tax increases came into effect on april  the increases in federal excise tax under the schip are substantial  and  as a result  liggett s sales volume and profitability has been and may continue to be adversely impacted 
in addition to federal and state excise taxes  certain city and county governments also impose substantial excise taxes on tobacco products sold 
increased excise taxes are likely to result in declines in overall sales volume and shifts by consumers to less expensive brands 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limit the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places 
private businesses also have adopted regulations that prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking 
such laws and regulations also are likely to result in a decline in the overall sales volume of cigarettes 
the newly enacted family smoking prevention and tobacco control act may adversely affect our sales and operating profit 
on june   president obama signed into law the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act hr 
the law grants the fda broad authority over the manufacture  sale  marketing and packaging of tobacco products  although the fda is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products  or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero 
among other measures  the law under various deadlines increases the number of health warnings required on cigarette and smokeless tobacco products  increases the size of warnings on packaging and in advertising  requires the fda to develop graphic warnings for cigarette packages  and grants the fda authority to require new warnings  requires practically all tobacco product advertising to eliminate color and imagery and instead consist solely of black text on white background  imposes new restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products  including significant new restrictions on tobacco product advertising and promotion as well as the use of brand and trade names  bans the use of light  mild  low or similar descriptors on tobacco products  bans the use of characterizing flavors in cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol  gives the fda the authority to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health by  for example  requiring reduction or elimination of the use of particular constituents or 
table of contents components  requiring product testing  or addressing other aspects of tobacco product construction  constituents  properties or labeling  requires manufacturers to obtain fda review and authorization for the marketing of certain new or modified tobacco products  requires pre market approval by the fda for tobacco products represented through labels  labeling  advertising  or other means as presenting a lower risk of harm or tobacco related disease  requires manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents and requires the fda to disclose certain constituent information to the public  mandates that manufacturers test and report on ingredients and constituents identified by the fda as requiring such testing to protect the public health  and allows the fda to require the disclosure of testing results to the public  requires manufacturers to submit to the fda certain information regarding the health  toxicological  behavioral or physiologic effects of tobacco products  prohibits use of tobacco containing a pesticide chemical residue at a level greater than allowed under federal law  requires the fda to establish good manufacturing practices to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities  requires tobacco product manufacturers and certain other entities to register with the fda  authorizes the fda to require the reduction of nicotine although it may not require the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero and the potential reduction or elimination of other constituents  including menthol  imposes and allows the fda to impose various recordkeeping and reporting requirements on tobacco product manufacturers  and grants the fda the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions 
the law also requires establishment  within the fda s new center for tobacco products  of a tobacco products scientific advisory committee to provide advice  information and recommendations with respect to the safety  dependence or health issues related to tobacco products  including a recommendation on modified risk applications  a recommendation on the effects of tobacco product nicotine yield alteration and whether there is a threshold level below which nicotine yields do not produce dependence  a report on the public health impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes  and a report on the public health impact of dissolvable tobacco products 
the law imposes user fees on certain tobacco product manufacturers in order to pay for the costs of regulation 
user fees will be allocated among tobacco product classes according to a formula set out in the legislation  and then among manufacturers and importers within each class based on market share 
the fda user fees for liggett and vector tobacco for were million and we estimate that they will be significantly higher in the future 
the law also imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products 
for example  the law requires the fda to finalize certain portions of regulations previously adopted by the fda in which were struck down by the supreme court in as beyond the fda s authority 
as written  these regulations would significantly limit the ability of manufacturers  distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products  by  for example  restricting the use of color  graphics and sound effects in advertising  limiting the use of outdoor advertising  restricting the sale and distribution of non tobacco items and services  gifts  and sponsorship of events and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless tobacco products of trade or 
table of contents brand names that are used for non tobacco products 
the law also requires the fda to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold through non face to face transactions 
it is likely that the new tobacco law could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states  including sales of liggett s and vector tobacco s brands 
total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by the fda under the new tobacco law 
costs  however  could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the companies financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  failure to comply with the new tobacco law and with fda regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operation of both liggett and vector tobacco 
at present  we are not able to predict whether the new tobacco law will impact liggett and vector tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry  thus affecting its competitive position 
furthermore  liggett and vector tobacco provide ingredient information annually  as required by law  to the states of massachusetts  texas and minnesota 
several other states are considering ingredient disclosure legislation 
over the years  various state and local governments have continued to regulate tobacco products  including smokeless tobacco products 
these regulations relate to  among other things  the imposition of significantly higher taxes  increases in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products  sampling and advertising bans or restrictions  ingredient and constituent disclosure requirements and significant tobacco control media campaigns 
additional state and local legislative and regulatory actions will likely be considered in the future  including  among other things  restrictions on the use of flavorings 
additional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising  labeling  or information disclosure of tobacco products could further reduce sales  increase costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 
litigation will continue to harm the tobacco industry 
liggett could be subjected to substantial liabilities and bonding requirements from litigation relating to cigarette products 
adverse litigation outcomes could have a negative impact on the company s ability to operate due to their impact on cash flows 
we and our liggett subsidiary  as well as the entire cigarette industry  continue to be challenged on numerous fronts 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of december   there were approximately  individual suits  including the engle progeny cases described below  seven purported class actions and four health care cost recovery actions pending in the united states in which liggett and or us were named defendants 
it is likely that similar legal actions  proceedings and claims will continue to be filed against liggett 
punitive damages  often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars  are specifically pled in these cases  in addition to compensatory and other damages 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liggett could face difficulties in obtaining a bond to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal 
a civil lawsuit was filed by the united states federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately billion from various cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
in august  the trial court entered a final judgment and remedial order against each of the cigarette manufacturing defendants  except liggett 
the final judgment  among other things  ordered the following relief against the non liggett defendants i defendants are enjoined from committing any act of racketeering concerning the manufacturing  marketing  promotion  health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states  ii defendants are enjoined from making any material false  misleading  or deceptive statement or representation concerning cigarettes that persuades people to purchase cigarettes  and iii defendants are permanently enjoined from utilizing lights  low tar  ultra lights  mild or natural descriptors  or conveying any other express or implied health messages in connection with the marketing or sale of cigarettes as of january  
table of contents no monetary damages were awarded other than the government s costs 
in october  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia stayed the final judgment pending appeal 
both the government and all defendants  other than liggett  have filed petitions for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court 
in its petition for writ of certiorari  the government is seeking reinstatement of its claims for remedies  including disgorgement of industry profits 
although this case has been concluded as to liggett  it is unclear what impact  if any  the final judgment will have on the cigarette industry as a whole 
to the extent that the final judgment leads to a decline in industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states or otherwise imposes regulations which adversely affect the industry  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
in december  the united states supreme court  in altria group inc v 
good  ruled that the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act did not preempt the state law claims asserted by the plaintiffs and that they could proceed with their claims under the maine unfair trade practices act 
this ruling has resulted in additional class action cases in other states 
although liggett is not a party in the good case  an adverse ruling or commencement of additional lights related class actions could have a material adverse impact on us 
there are currently five individual tobacco related actions pending where liggett is the only tobacco company defendant 
in ferlanti v 
liggett group  a florida state court jury awarded compensatory damages of million against liggett  but found that the plaintiff was at fault 
therefore  plaintiff was awarded  in compensatory damages plus  in expenses 
punitive damages were not awarded 
liggett appealed the award 
in may  the court granted plaintiff s motion for an award of attorneys fees but the amount has not yet been determined 
in hausrath v 
philip morris  a case pending in new york state court  plaintiffs recently dismissed all defendants other than liggett 
the other three individual actions  in which liggett is the only tobacco company defendant  are dormant 
as new cases are commenced  the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase 
individual tobacco related cases have increased as a result of the florida supreme court s ruling in engle 
in may  a florida intermediate appellate court overturned a million punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle v 
r 
j 
reynolds tobacco co 
smoking and health class action 
in july  the florida supreme court affirmed in part and reversed in part the may intermediate appellate court decision 
among other things  the florida supreme court affirmed the decision decertifying the class on a prospective basis and the order vacating the punitive damages award  but preserved several of the trial court s phase i findings including that i smoking causes lung cancer  among other diseases  ii nicotine in cigarettes is addictive  iii defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous  iv the defendants concealed material information  v all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective  and vi all defendants were negligent and allowed plaintiffs to proceed to trial on individual liability issues using the above findings and compensatory and punitive damage issues  provided they commence their individual lawsuits within one year of the date the court s decision became final on january   the date of the court s mandate 
in december  the florida supreme court added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that  at the time of sale or supply  did not conform to the representations made by defendants 
in june  the jury in a florida state court action entitled lukacs v 
rj reynolds tobacco company  awarded million in compensatory damages  jointly and severally  in a case involving liggett and two other cigarette manufacturers  which amount was subsequently reduced by the court 
the jury found liggett responsible for the damages incurred by the plaintiff 
the lukacs case was the first case to be tried as an individual engle class member suit following entry of final judgment by the engle trial court 
in november  the court entered final judgment in the amount of million for which liggett is responsible  plus interest from june the defendants appealed the final judgment 
plaintiff has filed a motion seeking an award of attorneys fees from liggett based on their prior proposal for settlement 
pursuant to the florida supreme court s july ruling in engle  former class members had one year from january  to file individual lawsuits 
in addition  some individuals who filed suit prior to january   
table of contents and who claim they meet the conditions in engle  are attempting to avail themselves of the engle ruling 
lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the engle ruling  whether filed before or after the january  mandate  are referred to as the engle progeny cases 
as of december   there were approximately  engle progeny cases pending where liggett  we and other cigarette manufacturers were named as defendants 
these cases include approximately  plaintiffs 
approximately cases are scheduled for trial in as of december   ten engle progeny cases had been tried resulting in eight plaintiff verdicts and two defense verdicts 
in one of the cases  a judgment against liggett was entered in the amount of  it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
we cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
regulation and legislation may negatively impact sales of tobacco products and our financial condition 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limit the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes and these laws have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places  and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
there are various other legislative efforts pending on the federal and state level which seek to  among other things  eliminate smoking in public places  further restrict displays and advertising of cigarettes  require additional warnings  including graphic warnings  on cigarette packaging and advertising  ban vending machine sales and curtail affirmative defenses of tobacco companies in product liability litigation 
the trend has had  and is more likely to continue to have  an adverse effect on us 
in addition to the foregoing  there have been a number of other restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies  including the united states environmental protection agency and the fda 
there have also been adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
recently  legislation was passed by congress providing for regulation of cigarettes by the fda 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
additionally  a majority of states have passed legislation providing for reduced ignition propensity standards for cigarettes 
these developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry  possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation  and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation 
we are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation  but our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
liggett may be adversely affected by the legislation to eliminate the federal tobacco quota system 
in october  federal legislation was enacted which eliminated the federal tobacco quota system and price support system through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders 
pursuant to the legislation  manufacturers of tobacco products will be assessed billion over a ten year period to compensate tobacco growers and quota holders for the elimination of their quota rights 
cigarette manufacturers will initially be responsible for of the assessment subject to adjustment in the future  which will be allocated based on relative unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
liggett s and vector tobacco s assessment was million in  million in and million in the relative cost of the legislation to each of the three largest cigarette manufacturers will likely be less than the cost to smaller manufacturers  including liggett and vector tobacco  because one effect of the legislation is that the three largest manufacturers will no longer be obligated to make certain contractual payments  commonly known as phase ii payments  they agreed in to make to tobacco producing states 
the ultimate impact of this legislation cannot be determined  but there is a risk that smaller manufacturers  such as liggett and vector tobacco  will be disproportionately affected by the legislation  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the parties  other than liggett have filed petitions for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court 
the government is seeking reinstatement of its claims for remedies  including disgorgement of profits 

table of contents excise tax increases adversely affect cigarette sales 
cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal  state and local excise taxes 
in february  federal legislation to reauthorize the schip  which includes funding provisions that increase the federal cigarette excise tax from to per pack  was enacted  effective april  state excise taxes vary considerably and  when combined with sales taxes  local taxes and the federal excise tax  may exceed per pack 
in  states and the district of columbia enacted increases in excise taxes 
various states and other jurisdictions are considering  or have pending  legislation proposing further state excise tax increases 
management believes increases in excise and similar taxes have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes 
liggett may have additional payment obligations under the master settlement agreement and its other settlement agreements with the states 
npm adjustment 
in march  an economic consulting firm selected pursuant to the msa rendered its final and non appealable decision that the msa was a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share of participating manufacturers for this is known as the npm adjustment 
the economic consulting firm subsequently rendered the same decision with respect to  and as a result  the manufacturers are entitled to potential npm adjustments to their   and msa payments 
the participating manufacturers are also entitled to potential npm adjustments to their  and payments pursuant to an agreement entered into in june between the opms and the settling states under which the opms agreed to make certain payments for the benefit of the settling states  in exchange for which the settling states stipulated that the msa was a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share of participating manufacturers in  and a settling state that has diligently enforced its qualifying escrow statute in the year in question may be able to avoid application of the npm adjustment to the payments made by the manufacturers for the benefit of that state or territory 
for through liggett and vector tobacco disputed that they owe the settling states the npm adjustments as calculated by the independent auditor 
as permitted by the msa  liggett and vector tobacco withheld payment associated with these npm adjustment amounts 
the total amount withheld or paid into a disputed payment account by liggett and vector tobacco for through is million 
in  liggett and vector tobacco paid the npm adjustment amount of million to the settling states although both companies continue to dispute this amount 
at december  included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet was a noncurrent receivable of million relating to such payment 
the following amounts have not been expensed by the company as they relate to liggett and vector tobacco s npm adjustment claims for through million for  million for and  for since april  notwithstanding provisions in the msa requiring arbitration  litigation was filed in settling states over the issue of whether the application of the npm adjustment for is to be determined through litigation or arbitration 
these actions relate to the potential npm adjustment for  which the independent auditor under the msa previously determined to be as much as billion for all participating manufacturers 
all but one of the courts that have decided the issue have ruled that the npm adjustment dispute is arbitrable 
all of those decisions are final and non appealable 
one court  the montana supreme court  ruled that montana s claim of diligent enforcement must be litigated 
in response to a proposal from the opms and many of the spms  of the settling states  representing approximately of the allocable share of the settling states  entered into an agreement providing for a nationwide arbitration of the dispute with respect to the npm adjustment for the agreement provides for selection of the arbitration panel beginning november  and that the parties and the arbitrators will thereafter establish the schedule and procedures for the arbitration 
because states representing more than of the allocable share signed the agreement  signing states will receive a reduction of any potential npm adjustment 
it is anticipated that the arbitration will commence in there can be no assurance that liggett or vector tobacco will receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings 
gross v 
net calculations 
in october  the independent auditor notified liggett and all other participating manufacturers that their payment obligations under the msa  dating from the agreement s execution 
table of contents in late  had been recalculated using net unit amounts  rather than gross unit amounts which had been used since 
liggett has objected to this retroactive change and has disputed the change in methodology 
liggett contends that the retroactive change from using gross to net unit amounts is impermissible for several reasons  including use of net unit amounts is not required by the msa as reflected by  among other things  the use of gross unit amounts through  such a change is not authorized without the consent of affected parties to the msa  the msa provides for four year time limitation periods for revisiting calculations and determinations  which precludes recalculating liggett s market share and thus  liggett s market share exemption  and liggett and others have relied upon the calculations based on gross unit amounts since the change in the method of calculation could  among other things  result in at least approximately million  plus interest  of additional msa payments for prior years by liggett  because the proposed change from gross to net units would serve to lower liggett s market share exemption under the msa 
the company currently estimates that future msa payments would be at least million higher if the method of calculation is changed 
no amounts have been expensed or accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any potential liability relating to the gross versus net dispute 
liggett may have additional payment obligations under its state settlements in  the attorneys general for each of florida  mississippi and texas advised liggett that they believed that liggett had failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states for the period through and that additional payments may be due for and subsequent years 
liggett believes these allegations are without merit  based  among other things  on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements and no amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any additional amounts that may be payable by liggett under the settlement agreements with florida  mississippi and texas 
there can be no assurance that liggett will prevail in any of these matters and that liggett will not be required to make additional material payments  which payments could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and the value of our common stock 
vector tobacco is subject to risks inherent in new product development initiatives 
we have made  and plan to continue to make  significant investments in vector tobacco s development projects in the tobacco industry 
vector tobacco is in the business of developing reduced risk cigarette products 
these initiatives are subject to high levels of risk  uncertainties and contingencies  including the challenges inherent in new product development and the increased regulation following the enactment of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act 
there is a risk that continued investments in vector tobacco will harm our results of operations  liquidity or cash flow 
the substantial risks facing vector tobacco include potential extensive government regulation 
vector tobacco s business is currently extensively regulated  and may become subject to extensive additional domestic and international government regulation 
various proposals have been made for federal  state and international legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers generally  and reduced constituent cigarettes specifically 
it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted covering matters such as the manufacture  sale  distribution and labeling of tobacco products as well as any health claims associated with reduced risk and low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products 
there could be additional regulation established by agencies such as the fda including further regulation resulting from passage of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act in june  the federal trade commission and the united states department of agriculture 
the outcome of any of the foregoing cannot be predicted  but any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on vector tobacco s business  operating results and prospects 

table of contents competition from other cigarette manufacturers with greater resources 
vector tobacco s competitors generally have substantially greater resources than vector tobacco  including financial  marketing and personnel resources 
other major tobacco companies have stated that they are working on reduced risk cigarette products and have made publicly available at this time only limited additional information concerning their activities 
philip morris has announced it is developing products that potentially reduce smokers exposure to harmful compounds in cigarette smoke 
rjr tobacco has disclosed that a primary focus for its research and development activity is the development of potentially reduced exposure products  which may ultimately be recognized as products that present reduced risks to health 
rjr tobacco has stated that it continues to sell in limited distribution throughout the country a brand of cigarettes that primarily heats rather than burns tobacco  which it claims reduces the toxicity of its smoke 
there is a substantial likelihood that other major tobacco companies will continue to introduce new products that would compete directly with any reduced risk products that vector tobacco may develop 
intellectual property rights  including vector tobacco s patents involve complex legal and factual issues 
any conflicts resulting from third party patent applications and granted patents could significantly limit vector tobacco s ability to obtain meaningful patent protection or to commercialize its technology 
if patents currently exist or are issued to other companies that contain claims which encompass vector tobacco s products or the processes used by vector tobacco to manufacture or develop its products  vector tobacco may be required to obtain licenses to use these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if licenses are not obtained  vector tobacco could be delayed in  or prevented from  pursuing the further development of marketing of its new cigarette products 
any alternative technology  if feasible  could take several years to develop 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost  also may be necessary to enforce any patents to which vector tobacco has rights  or to determine the scope  validity and unenforceability of other parties proprietary rights which may affect vector tobacco s rights 
vector tobacco also may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine the priority of an invention or in opposition proceedings in foreign countries or jurisdictions  which could result in substantial costs 
the mere uncertainty resulting from the institution and continuation of any technology related litigation or any interference or opposition proceedings could have a material adverse effect on vector tobacco s business  operating results and prospects 
vector tobacco may also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to maintain its competitive position  which it seeks to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  suppliers and others 
there is a risk that these agreements will be breached or terminated  that vector tobacco will not have adequate remedies for any breach  or that its trade secrets will otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
new valley is subject to risks relating to the industries in which it operates 
risks of real estate ventures 
new valley has three significant real estate related investments  douglas elliman realty interest  new valley oaktree chelsea eleven llc interest and aberdeen townhomes llc preferred return  where other partners hold significant interests 
new valley must seek approval from these other parties for important actions regarding these joint ventures 
since the other parties interests may differ from those of new valley  a deadlock could arise that might impair the ability of the ventures to function 
such a deadlock could significantly harm the ventures 
the volatility in the capital and credit markets has increased in recent years 
because the volatility in capital and credit markets may create additional risks in the upcoming months and possibly years  the company will continue to perform additional assessments to determine the impact  if any  on the company s consolidated financial statements 
thus  future impairment charges may occur 
new valley may pursue a variety of real estate development projects 
development projects are subject to special risks including potential increase in costs  changes in market demand  inability to meet deadlines which may delay the timely completion of projects  reliance on contractors who may be unable to perform and the need to obtain various governmental and third party consents 

table of contents risks relating to the residential brokerage business 
through new valley s investment in douglas elliman realty  we are subject to the risks and uncertainties endemic to the residential brokerage business 
douglas elliman realty s two subsidiaries  which conduct business as prudential douglas elliman real estate  operate as franchisees of the prudential real estate affiliates  inc prudential douglas elliman real estate operates each of its offices under its franchiser s brand name  and the franchiser has significant rights over the use of the franchised service marks and the conduct of the two brokerage companies business 
the franchise agreements require the companies to coordinate with the franchiser on significant matters relating to their operations  including the opening and closing of offices  make substantial royalty payments to the franchiser and contribute significant amounts to national advertising funds maintained by the franchiser  indemnify the franchiser against losses arising out of the operations of their business under the franchise agreements  and maintain standards and comply with guidelines relating to their operations which are applicable to all franchisees of the franchiser s real estate franchise system 
the franchiser has the right to terminate prudential douglas elliman real estate s franchises  upon the occurrence of certain events  including a bankruptcy or insolvency event  a change in control  a transfer of rights under the franchise agreement and a failure to promptly pay amounts due under the franchise agreements 
a termination of prudential douglas elliman real estate s franchise agreements could adversely affect our investment in douglas elliman realty 
the franchise agreements grant prudential douglas elliman real estate exclusive franchises in new york for the counties of nassau and suffolk on long island and for manhattan  brooklyn and queens  subject to various exceptions and to meeting specified annual revenue thresholds 
if the company fails to achieve these levels of revenues for two consecutive years or otherwise materially breach the franchise agreements  the franchiser would have the right to terminate its exclusivity rights 
a loss of these rights could have a material adverse on douglas elliman realty 
real estate ventures and mortgage receivables have been negatively impacted by the current downturn in the residential real estate market 
the us residential real estate market  including the new york metropolitan area where douglas elliman realty operates  is cyclical and is affected by changes in the general economic conditions that are beyond the control of douglas elliman realty 
the us residential real estate market is currently in a significant downturn due to various factors including downward pressure on housing prices  credit constraints inhibiting new buyers and an exceptionally large inventory of unsold homes at the same time that sales volumes are decreasing 
the depth and length of the current downturn in the real estate industry has proved exceedingly difficult to predict 
we cannot predict whether the downturn will worsen or when the market and related economic forces will return the us residential real estate industry to a growth period 
any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our real estate ventures by causing a general decline in the number of home sales and or prices  which in turn  could adversely affect their revenues and profitability periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  the general availability of mortgage financing  including the impact of the recent contraction in the subprime and mortgage markets generally  and the effect of more stringent lending standards for home mortgages  adverse changes in economic and general business conditions in the new york metropolitan area  a decrease in the affordability of homes  
table of contents declining demand for real estate  a negative perception of the market for residential real estate  commission pressure from brokers who discount their commissions  acts of god  such as hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters  or acts or threats of war or terrorism  and or an increase in the cost of homeowners insurance 
the three major real estate ventures current operations are located in the new york metropolitan area 
local and regional economic and general business conditions in this market could differ materially from prevailing conditions in other parts of the country 
among other things  the new york metropolitan area residential real estate market has been impacted by the significant downturn in the financial services industry 
a continued downturn in the residential real estate market or economic conditions in that region could have a material adverse effect on these investments 
potential new investments we may make are unidentified and may not succeed 
we currently hold a significant amount of marketable securities and cash not committed to any specific investments 
this subjects a security holder to increased risk and uncertainty because a security holder will not be able to evaluate how this cash will be invested and the economic merits of particular investments 
there may be substantial delay in locating suitable investment opportunities 
in addition  we may lack relevant management experience in the areas in which we may invest 
there is a risk that we will fail in targeting  consummating or effectively integrating or managing any of these investments 
we depend on our key personnel 
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal control over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to assess  and our independent registered certified public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
we completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended december   and we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to continue to comply with these requirements 
we expect to continue to incur expense and to devote management resources to section compliance 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered certified public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions and our reputation may be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 
the trading price of our common stock has ranged between and per share over the past weeks 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  the operating and stock performance of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contract  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  
table of contents the initiation or outcome of litigation  changes in interest rates  general economic  market and political conditions  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of our equity or convertible securities 
we cannot predict the extent  if any  to which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  may depress the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
furthermore  stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly  which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management 
these factors  among others  could significantly depress the price of our common stock 
we have many potentially dilutive securities outstanding 
at december   we had outstanding options granted to employees to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  of which options for  shares were exercisable at december  we also have outstanding convertible notes and debentures maturing in november and june  which are currently convertible into  shares of our common stock 
the issuance of these shares will cause dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the availability for sale of significant quantities of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the stock

all of liggett s unit sales volume in  and was in the discount segment  which liggett s management believes has been the primary growth segment in the industry for over a decade 
the significant discounting of premium cigarettes in recent years has led to brands  such as eve  that were traditionally considered premium brands to become more appropriately categorized as discount  following list price reductions

liggett  however  is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us cigarette market 
additionally  vector tobacco has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us market 
liggett s and vector tobacco s payments under the master settlement agreement are based on each company s incremental market share above the minimum threshold applicable to such company

the discount segment is a challenging marketplace  with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price

recent developments in tobacco related litigation the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of december   there were approximately  individual suits excluding approximately individual cases pending in west virginia state court as part of a consolidated action  liggett has been severed from the trial of the consolidated action  seven purported class actions and four healthcare cost recovery actions pending in the united states in which liggett or us  or both  were named as a defendant 
liggett only cases 
in april  in davis v 
liggett group  a florida state court jury awarded compensatory damages of against liggett  plus interest and attorneys fees 
this award is final and was paid by liggett 
there are currently five cases pending where liggett is the only tobacco company defendant 
cases where liggett is the only defendant could increase substantially as a result of the engle progeny cases 
in february  in ferlanti v 
liggett group  a florida state court jury awarded compensatory damages of  against liggett  but found that the plaintiff was at fault 
therefore  plaintiff was awarded in compensatory damages plus in expenses 
punitive damages were not awarded 
liggett appealed the award 
in may  the court granted plaintiff s motion for an award of attorneys fees but the amount has not yet been determined 
in hausrath v 
philip morris  a case pending in new york state court  plaintiffs recently dismissed all defendants other than liggett 
the other three individual actions  in which liggett is the only tobacco company defendant  are dormant 
engle progeny cases 
in  a jury in engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co 
rendered a  punitive damages verdict in favor of a florida class against certain cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
pursuant to the florida supreme court s july ruling in engle  which decertified the class on a prospective basis  and affirmed the appellate court s reversal of the punitive damages award  former class members had one year from january  in which to file individual lawsuits 
in addition  some individuals who filed suit prior to january   and who claim they meet the conditions in engle  are attempting to avail themselves of the engle ruling 
lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the engle ruling  whether filed before or after the january  deadline  are referred to as the engle progeny cases 
liggett and or the company have been named in approximately  engle progeny cases in both state and federal courts in florida 
other cigarette manufacturers have also been named as defendants in these cases 
these cases include approximately  plaintiffs  approximately  of whom have claims pending in federal court 
duplicate cases were filed in federal and state court on behalf of approximately plaintiffs 
the majority of the cases pending in federal court are stayed pending the outcome of an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit of several district court orders in which it was found that the florida supreme court s decision in engle was unconstitutional 
the number of progeny cases will likely increase as the courts may require multi plaintiff cases to be severed into individual cases 
the total number of plaintiffs may also increase as a result of attempts by existing plaintiffs to add additional parties 
as of december   alleged engle progeny cases  where liggett is currently named as a defendant  were scheduled for trial in as of december   ten engle progeny cases have been tried resulting in eight plaintiff verdicts and two defense verdicts 
in one of these cases  the campbell case  the jury awarded  in compensatory damages against all defendants  of which was awarded against liggett 
these cases are all currently on appeal 
in june  the jury in lukacs v 
r 
j 
reynolds tobacco company  an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case  awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages  plus interest  jointly and severally  against liggett and two other cigarette manufacturers and found liggett responsible for the damages 
in november  the court entered final judgment 
the defendants have appealed 
the plaintiffs are seeking an award of attorneys fees from liggett 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is 
table of contents appropriate to do so 
we cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates subject to material changes in the near term include restructuring and impairment charges  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  promotional accruals  sales returns and allowances  actuarial assumptions of pension plans  the estimated fair value of embedded derivative liabilities  settlement accruals restructuring  valuation of investments  including other than temporary impairments to such investments  accounting for investments in equity securities  and litigation and defense costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of cigarettes are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide an allowance for expected sales returns  net of any related inventory cost recoveries 
in accordance with authoritative guidance on how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  our accounting policy is to include federal excise taxes in revenues and cost of goods sold 
such revenues and cost of sales totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since our primary line of business is tobacco  our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by significant unit sales volume declines  litigation and defense costs  increased tobacco costs or reductions in the selling price of cigarettes in the near term 
marketing costs 
we record marketing costs as an expense in the period to which such costs relate 
we do not defer the recognition of any amounts on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to marketing costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred  which is the period in which the related advertisement initially appears 
we record consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as a reduction in revenue in the period in which these programs are offered  based on estimates of utilization and redemption rates that are developed from historical information 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we have recorded charges related to employee severance and benefits  asset impairments  contract termination and other associated exit costs during   and the calculation of severance pay requires management to identify employees to be terminated and the timing of their severance from employment 
the calculation of benefits charges requires actuarial assumptions including determination of discount rates 
the asset impairments were recorded in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires management to estimate the fair value of assets to be disposed of 
these restructuring charges are based on management s best estimate at the time of restructuring 
the status of the restructuring activities is reviewed on a quarterly basis and any adjustments to the reserve  which could differ materially from previous estimates  are recorded as an adjustment to operating income 
contingencies 
we record liggett s product liability legal expenses and other litigation costs as operating  selling  general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and above under the heading recent developments in tobacco related litigation  legal proceedings are pending or threatened in various jurisdictions against liggett 
a large number of individual product liability cases have been filed in state and federal courts in florida as a result of the florida supreme court s decision in the engle case 
we record a provision for loss in litigation in our consolidated financial statements when we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in all our pending legal proceedings  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate with respect to the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobacco related litigation or the costs of defending such cases  and  except for the previously mentioned case  we have not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
you should not infer from the absence of any such reserve in 
table of contents our consolidated financial statements that liggett will not be subject to significant tobacco related liabilities in the future 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation 
settlement agreements 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  liggett and vector tobacco are participants in the master settlement agreement  the agreement to settle governmental healthcare cost recovery actions brought by various states 
liggett and vector tobacco have no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement except to the extent their market shares exceed approximately and  respectively  of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
their obligations  and the related expense charges under the master settlement agreement  are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by liggett and vector tobacco  their relative market shares and inflation 
since relative market shares are based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under the master settlement agreement is recorded in cost of goods sold as the products are shipped 
settlement expenses under the master settlement agreement recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were  for   for and  for adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
derivatives  beneficial conversion feature 
we measure all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts  at fair value and recognize them in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on our rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
we have issued variable interest senior convertible debt in a series of private placements where a portion of the total interest payable on the debt is computed by reference to the cash dividends paid on our common stock 
this portion of the interest payment is considered an embedded derivative within the convertible debt  which we are required to separately value 
as a result  we have bifurcated this embedded derivative and estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative liability 
the resulting discount created by allocating a portion of the issuance proceeds to the embedded derivative is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method 
at december  and  the fair value of derivative liabilities was estimated at  and  respectively 
the increase is due to the issuance of an additional  of convertible debt in and the losses on the changes in fair value of convertible debt 
changes to the fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations as changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt 
we recognized a loss of  in  a gain of  in and a loss of  in due to changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives 
after giving effect to the recording of embedded derivative liabilities as a discount to the convertible debt  our common stock had a fair value at the issuance date of the notes in excess of the conversion price  resulting in a beneficial conversion feature 
the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as additional paid in capital and as a further discount on the debt 
the discount is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method 
we recognized non cash interest expense of   and  in  and  respectively  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the embedded derivatives and   and  in  and  respectively  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature 
inventories 
tobacco inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined primarily by the last in  first out lifo method at liggett and vector tobacco 
although portions of leaf tobacco inventories may not be used or sold within one year because of time required for aging  they are included in current assets  which is common practice in the industry 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 

table of contents stock based compensation 
our stock based compensation uses a fair value based method to recognize non cash compensation expense for share based transactions 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of  and in  and related to the amortization of stock option awards and   and  related to the amortization of restricted stock grants 
as of december  and  there was  and  respectively  of total unrecognized cost related to employee stock options and  and  respectively  of total unrecognized cost related to restricted stock grants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
employee benefit plans 
the determination of our net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
we determine discount rates by using a quantitative analysis that considers the prevailing prices of investment grade bonds and the anticipated cash flow from our two qualified defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical and life insurance plans 
these analyses construct a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the annual projected cash flows from our pension and retiree health plans 
as of december   our benefit obligations and service cost were computed assuming a discount rate of and  respectively 
in determining our expected rate of return on plan assets we consider input from our external advisors and historical returns based on the expected long term rate of return is the weighted average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset class 
our actual year annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and our actual five year annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in computing expense for the year ended december   we will use an assumption of a annual rate of return on our pension plan assets 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized income or expense in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our future net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense 
net pension expense for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit expense aggregated approximately   and  for  and  respectively  and we currently anticipate such expense will be approximately  for in contrast  our funding obligations under the pension plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
to comply with erisa s minimum funding requirements  we do not currently anticipate that we will be required to make any funding to the tax qualified pension plans for the pension plan year beginning on january  and ending on december  in september  the fasb issued amended authoritative guidance over employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of their benefit plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur as a component of other comprehensive income 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and its benefit obligation 
the prospective requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and to provide the required disclosures became effective for us on december  in addition  the amended guidance requires an employer to measure benefit plan assets and obligations that determine the funded status of a plan as of the end of its fiscal year 
prior to the adoption of this guidance  we measured the funded status of our plans at september the new measurement date requirements became effective for us on december  long term investments and impairments 
at december   we had long term investments of  which consisted primarily of investment partnerships investing in investment securities and real estate 
the investments in these investment partnerships are illiquid and the ultimate realization of these investments is subject to the performance of the underlying partnership and its management by the general partners 
the estimated fair value of the investment partnerships is provided by the partnerships based on the indicated market values of the underlying assets or investment portfolio 
gains are recognized when realized in our consolidated statement of 
table of contents operations 
losses are recognized as realized or upon the determination of the occurrence of an other than temporary decline in fair value 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our investments to determine whether an impairment has occurred 
if so  we also make a determination of whether such impairment is considered temporary or other than temporary 
we believe that the assessment of temporary or other than temporary impairment is facts and circumstances driven 
however  among the matters that are considered in making such a determination are the period of time the investment has remained below its cost or carrying value  the severity of the decline  the likelihood of recovery given the reason for the decrease in market value and our original expected holding period of the investment 
income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time and  as a result  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments may materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions

liggett has a  credit facility with wachovia bank  na under which  was outstanding at december  availability as determined under the facility was approximately  based on eligible collateral at december  the facility contains covenants that provide that liggett s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined under the facility  on a trailing twelve month basis  shall not be less than  if liggett s excess availability  as defined  under the facility is less than  the covenants also require that annual capital expenditures  as defined under the facility  before a maximum carryover amount of  shall not exceed  during any fiscal year 
at december   management believed that liggett was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility  liggett s ebitda  as defined  were approximately  for the twelve months ended december  in august  wachovia made an  term loan to maple llc  a subsidiary of liggett  within the commitment under the existing credit facility 
the  term loan is collateralized by the existing collateral securing the credit facility  and is also collateralized by a lien on certain real property in mebane  nc owned by maple llc 
the mebane property also secures the other obligations of liggett under the credit facility 
the  term loan did not increase the  borrowing amount of the credit facility  but did increase the outstanding amounts under the credit facility by the amount of the term loan and proportionately reduces the maximum borrowing availability under the facility 

table of contents in august  liggett and wachovia amended the credit facility to permit the guaranty of our senior secured notes by each of liggett and maple and the pledging of certain assets of liggett and maple on a subordinated basis to secure their guarantees 
the credit facility was also amended to grant to wachovia a blanket lien on all the assets of liggett and maple  excluding any equipment pledged to current or future purchase money or other financiers of such equipment and excluding any real property  other than the mebane property and other real property to the extent its value is in excess of  in connection with the amendment  wachovia  liggett  maple and the collateral agent for the holders of our senior secured notes entered into an intercreditor agreement  pursuant to which the liens of the collateral agent on the liggett and maple assets will be subordinated to the liens of wachovia on the liggett and maple assets

liggett and other united states cigarette manufacturers have been named as defendants in a number of direct  third party and purported class actions predicated on the theory that they should be liable for damages alleged to have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to secondary smoke from cigarettes 
we believe  and have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that liggett has a number of valid defenses to claims asserted against it  however  litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
as of december   interest on the award was more than  it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably 
there are approximately  engle progeny cases  in state and federal courts in florida  where liggett and other cigarette manufacturers and us  were named as defendants 
these cases include approximately  plaintiffs 
approximately cases are currently scheduled for trial in to date  ten engle progeny cases have gone to trial resulting in eight plaintiff verdicts and two defense verdicts 
in one of these cases  judgment was entered against liggett for liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
an unfavorable outcome of a pending smoking and health case could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
in recent years  there have been a number of adverse regulatory  political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
neither we nor liggett are able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation or regulation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements and legislation and regulation below for a description of legislation  regulation and litigation 
management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against liggett or the costs of defending such cases 
it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation

the senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that are engaged in the conduct of our cigarette businesses 
in addition  some of the guarantees are collateralized by second priority or first priority security interests in certain collateral of some of the subsidiary guarantors pursuant to security and pledge agreements 
the indenture contains covenants that restrict the payment of dividends by us if our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  which is defined in the indenture as consolidated ebitda  for the most recently ended four full quarters is less than  the indenture also restricts the incurrence of debt if our leverage ratio and our secured leverage ratio  as defined in the indenture  exceed and  respectively 
our leverage ratio is defined in the indenture as the ratio of our and our guaranteeing subsidiaries total debt less the fair market value of our cash  investments in marketable securities and long term investments to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the indenture 
our secured leverage ratio is defined in the indenture in the same manner as 
table of contents the leverage ratio  except that secured indebtedness is substituted for indebtedness 
the following table summarizes the requirements of these financial covenants and the results of the calculation  as defined by the indenture 
indenture december  december  covenant requirement consolidated ebitda  as defined leverage ratio  as defined to to to secured leverage ratio  as defined to negative negative we and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations

there is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt 
if we cannot service our fixed charges  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we believe that our cigarette operations are positive cash flow generating units and will continue to be able to sustain their operations without any significant liquidity concerns 
in order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other anticipated liquidity needs in the normal course of business  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  investment securities available for sale of approximately  long term investments with an estimated value of approximately  and availability under liggett s credit facility of approximately  at december  management currently anticipates that these amounts  as well as expected cash flows from our operations  proceeds from public and or private debt and equity financing  management fees and other payments from subsidiaries should be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs over the next months 
we may acquire or seek to acquire additional operating businesses through merger  purchase of assets  stock acquisition or other means  or to make other investments  which may limit our liquidity otherwise available 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our investments to determine whether an impairment has occurred 
if so  we also make a determination if such impairment is considered temporary or other than temporary 
we believe that the assessment of temporary or other than temporary impairment is facts and circumstances driven 
however  among the matters that are considered in making such a determination are the period of time the investment has remained below its cost or carrying value  the likelihood of recovery given the reason for the decrease in market value and our original expected holding period of the investment 
we adopted authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes as of january  this guidance requires an entity to recognize the financial statement impact of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination 
if the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax effect is recognized at the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it requires that a liability created for unrecognized deferred tax benefits shall be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax liabilities or assets 
we did not recognize any adjustment in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  as a result of the adoption of this guidance that impacted our accumulated deficit at december  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was  at january  and decreased  during the year ended december  the total amount of tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was  at january  and decreased  during the year ended december  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was  at january  and increased  during the year ended december  the total amount of tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate was  and  at december  and  respectively 

table of contents we or our subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and returns with various state and local jurisdictions 
our consolidated balance sheets include deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent temporary differences in the application of accounting rules established by generally accepted accounting principles and income tax laws 
as of december   our deferred income tax liabilities exceeded our deferred income tax assets by  our current deferred income tax liabilities decreased by approximately  during primarily as a result of tax payments of approximately  made in in connection with the philip morris brands transaction 
these tax payments resulted from our settlement with the internal revenue service in july  which required us to recognize taxable income of approximately  from the philip morris brand transaction by march  we continue to classify all interest and penalties as income tax expense

off balance sheet arrangements we have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights 
payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and or amount  and in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not been material 
as of december   we were not aware of any indemnification agreements that would or are reasonably expected to have a current or future material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  liggett vector brands and another cigarette manufacturer entered into a five year agreement with a subsidiary of the american wholesale marketers association to support a program to permit tobacco distributors to secure  on reasonable terms  tax stamp bonds required by state and local governments for the distribution of cigarettes 
under the agreement  liggett vector brands has agreed to pay a portion of losses  if any  incurred by the surety under the bond program  with a maximum loss exposure of for liggett vector brands 
to secure its potential obligations under the agreement  liggett vector brands has delivered to the subsidiary of the association a letter of credit and agreed to fund up to an additional liggett vector brands has incurred no losses to date under this agreement  and we believe the fair value of liggett vector brands obligation under the agreement was immaterial at december  at december   we had outstanding approximately  of letters of credit  collateralized by certificates of deposit 
the letters of credit have been issued as security deposits for leases of office space  to secure the performance of our subsidiaries under various insurance programs and to provide collateral for various subsidiary borrowing and capital lease arrangements 
as of december   new valley has committed to fund up to to an investment partnership in which it is an investor 
as of december  we have committed to fund up to in a credit line to our investee  castle brands inc market risk we are exposed to market risks principally from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through our regular operating and financing activities and our long term investment strategy 
our market risk management procedures cover all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as of december   approximately  of our outstanding debt at face value had variable interest rates determined by various interest rate indices  which increases the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our variable rate borrowings  which could 
table of contents adversely affect our cash flows 
as of december   we had no interest rate caps or swaps 
based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately in addition  as of december   approximately   principal amount of outstanding debt had a variable interest rate determined by the amount of the dividends on our common stock 
the difference between the stated value of the debt and carrying value is due principally to certain embedded derivatives  which were separately valued and recorded upon issuance 
changes to the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected within our statements of operations as changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt and changes in the closing stock price at the end of each quarterly period 
based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt could increase or decrease by approximately  with approximately resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our note due   resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our exchange notes due  and the remaining  resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our variable interest senior convertible debentures due an increase in our quarterly dividend rate by per share would increase interest expense by approximately  per year 
we have estimated the fair market value of the embedded derivatives based principally on the results of a valuation model 
the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within the convertible debt is based principally on the present value of future dividend payments expected to be received by the convertible debt holders over the term of the debt 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is estimated based on a spread in yield of our debt when compared to risk free securities with the same duration  thus  a readily determinable fair market value of the embedded derivatives is not available 
the valuation model assumes our future dividend payments and utilizes interest rates and credit spreads for secured to unsecured debt  unsecured to subordinated debt and subordinated debt to preferred stock to determine the fair value of the derivatives embedded within the convertible debt 
the valuation also considers items  including current and future dividends and the volatility of vector s stock price 
the range of estimated fair market values of our embedded derivatives was between  and  we recorded the fair market value of our embedded derivatives at the midpoint of the inputs at  as of december  the estimated fair market value of our embedded derivatives could change significantly based on future market conditions 
we held investment securities available for sale totaling  at december   which includes  shares of ladenburg thalmann financial services inc carried at  in may  june  and july  we purchased  common shares of strategic hotels resorts  inc for approximately  excluding commissions

see note to our consolidated financial statements 
adverse market conditions could have a significant effect on the value of these investments 
we and new valley also hold long term investments in various investment partnerships 
these investments are illiquid  and their ultimate realization is subject to the performance of the underlying entities

legislation and regulation reports with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years and  in the opinion of liggett s management  have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on 
table of contents cigarette sales 
since  the surgeon general of the united states and the secretary of health and human services have released a number of reports which state that cigarette smoking is a causative factor with respect to a variety of health hazards  including cancer  heart disease and lung disease  and have recommended various government actions to reduce the incidence of smoking 
in  liggett publicly acknowledged that  as the surgeon general and respected medical researchers have found  smoking causes health problems  including lung cancer  heart and vascular disease  and emphysema 
on june   the president signed into law the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act public law 
the law grants the food and drug administration fda broad authority over the manufacture  sale  marketing and packaging of tobacco products  although the fda is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products  or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero 
among other measures  the law under various deadlines increases the number of health warnings required on cigarette and smokeless tobacco products  increases the size of warnings on packaging and in advertising  requires the fda to develop graphic warnings for cigarette packages  and grants the fda authority to require new warnings  requires practically all tobacco product advertising to eliminate color and imagery and instead consist solely of black text on white background  imposes new restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products  including significant new restrictions on tobacco product advertising and promotion  as well as the use of brand and trade names  bans the use of light  mild  low or similar descriptors on tobacco products  bans the use of characterizing flavors in cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol  gives the fda the authority to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health by  for example  requiring reduction or elimination of the use of particular constituents or components  requiring product testing  or addressing other aspects of tobacco product construction  constituents  properties or labeling  requires manufacturers to obtain fda review and authorization for the marketing of certain new or modified tobacco products  requires pre market approval by the fda for tobacco products represented through labels  labeling  advertising  or other means as presenting a lower risk of harm or tobacco related disease  requires manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents and requires the fda to disclose certain constituent information to the public  mandates that manufacturers test and report on ingredients and constituents identified by the fda as requiring such testing to protect the public health  and allows the fda to require the disclosure of testing results to the public  requires manufacturers to submit to the fda certain information regarding the health  toxicological  behavioral or physiologic effects of tobacco products  prohibits use of tobacco containing a pesticide chemical residue at a level greater than allowed under federal law  requires the fda to establish good manufacturing practices to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities  requires tobacco product manufacturers and certain other entities to register with the fda  authorizes the fda to require the reduction of nicotine although it may not require the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero and the potential reduction or elimination of other constituents  including menthol  
table of contents imposes and allows the fda to impose various recordkeeping and reporting requirements on tobacco product manufacturers  and grants the fda the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions 
the law also requires establishment  within the fda s new center for tobacco products  of a tobacco products scientific advisory committee to provide advice  information and recommendations with respect to the safety  dependence or health issues related to tobacco products  including a recommendation on modified risk applications  a recommendation on the effects of tobacco product nicotine yield alteration and whether there is a threshold level below which nicotine yields do not produce dependence  a report on the public health impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes  and a report on the public health impact of dissolvable tobacco products 
the law imposes user fees on certain tobacco product manufacturers in order to fund tobacco related fda activities 
user fees will be allocated among tobacco product classes according to a formula set out in the legislation  and then among manufacturers and importers within each class based on market share 
the fda user fees for liggett and vector tobacco for were  and we estimate that they will be significantly higher in the future 
the law also imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products 
for example  the law requires the fda to finalize certain portions of regulations previously adopted by the fda in which were struck down by the supreme court in as beyond the fda s authority 
as written  these regulations would significantly limit the ability of manufacturers  distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products  by  for example  restricting the use of color and graphics in advertising  limiting the use of outdoor advertising  restricting the sale and distribution of non tobacco items and services  gifts  and sponsorship of events  and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless tobacco products of trade or brand names that are used for nontobacco products 
in august  several cigarette manufacturers filed a federal lawsuit against fda challenging the constitutionality of a number of the restrictions imposed by these regulations  including the ban on color and graphics  limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products  restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising  and a ban on the distribution of product samples 
on january   a federal judge ruled that the regulations ban on the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising was unconstitutional and prohibited fda from enforcing that ban 
the judge  however  let stand numerous other advertising and promotion restrictions 
while we would expect this decision to be appealed  we cannot predict the future course or outcome of this lawsuit 
separately  the law also requires the fda to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold through non face to face transactions 
it is likely that the new tobacco law could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states  including sales of liggett s and vector tobacco s brands 
total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by the fda under the new tobacco law 
costs  however  could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the companies financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  failure to comply with the new tobacco law and with fda regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operation of both liggett and vector tobacco 
at present  we are not able to predict whether the new tobacco law will impact liggett and vector tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry  thus affecting its competitive position 
liggett and vector tobacco provide ingredient information annually  as required by law  to the states of massachusetts  texas and minnesota 
several other states are considering ingredient disclosure legislation 

table of contents in october  the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of fetra was signed into law 
fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders 
pursuant to the legislation  manufacturers of tobacco products have been assessed  over a ten year period  commencing in  to compensate tobacco growers and quota holders for the elimination of their quota rights 
cigarette manufacturers are currently responsible for of the assessment subject to adjustment in the future  which is allocated based on relative unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
liggett s and vector tobacco s assessment was approximately  for management anticipates that the assessment will be higher for the relative cost of the legislation to the three largest cigarette manufacturers will likely be less than the cost to smaller manufacturers  including liggett and vector tobacco  because one effect of the legislation is that the three largest manufacturers are no longer obligated to make certain contractual payments  commonly known as phase ii payments  that they agreed in to make to tobacco producing states 
the ultimate impact of this legislation cannot be determined  but there is a risk that smaller manufacturers  such as liggett and vector tobacco  will be disproportionately affected by the legislation  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal  state and local excise taxes 
effective april   the federal cigarette excise tax increased from to per pack 
state excise taxes vary considerably and  when combined with sales taxes  local taxes and the federal excise tax  may exceed per pack 
in  states and the district of columbia enacted increases in excise taxes and several other states are considering  or have pending  legislation proposing further state excise tax increases 
management believes increases in excise and similar taxes have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes 
over the last several years a majority of states have enacted virtually identical legislation requiring cigarettes to meet a laboratory test standard for reduced ignition propensity 
cigarettes that meet this standard are referred to as fire standards compliant or fsc  and are sometimes commonly called self extinguishing 
effective january   substantially all of the cigarettes that liggett and vector tobacco manufacture are fire standards compliant 
compliance with such legislation could be burdensome and costly and could harm the business of liggett and vector tobacco  particularly if there were to be varying standards from state to state 
in november  the federal trade commission ftc rescinded guidance it issued in that generally permitted statements concerning cigarette tar and nicotine yields if they were based on the cambridge filter method  sometimes called the ftc method 
in its rescission notice  the ftc also indicated that advertisers should no longer use terms suggesting the ftc s endorsement or approval of any specific test method  including terms such as per ftc method or other phrases that state or imply ftc endorsement or approval of the cambridge filter method or other machine based methods for measuring cigarette tar or nicotine yields 
also in its rescission notice  the ftc indicated that cigarette descriptors such as light and ultra light have not been defined by the ftc  nor has the ftc provided any guidance or authorization for their use 
the ftc indicated that to the extent descriptors are used in a manner that convey an overall impression that is false  misleading  or unsubstantiated  such use could be actionable 
the ftc further indicated that companies must ensure that any continued use of descriptors does not convey an erroneous or unsubstantiated message that a particular cigarette presents a reduced risk of harm or is otherwise likely to mislead consumers 
in response to the ftc s action  we have removed all reference to tar and nicotine testing from our point of sale advertising 
in addition  the new tobacco law imposes a ban scheduled to take effect in june on the use of light  mild  low or similar descriptors on tobacco product labels and in labeling or advertising 
to the extent descriptors are no longer used to market or promote our cigarettes  this may have a material adverse effect on us 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limit the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes  and these laws have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places  and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
there are various other legislative efforts pending at the federal  state or local level which seek to  among other things  eliminate smoking in public places  curtail affirmative defenses of tobacco companies in product liability litigation  and further restrict the sale  marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products 
this trend has had  and is likely to continue to have  an adverse effect on us
