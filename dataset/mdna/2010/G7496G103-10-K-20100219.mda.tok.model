item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance segment our reinsurance operations are comprised of three units property catastrophe reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  specialty reinsurance  primarily written through renaissance reinsurance and davinci  and certain other activities of ventures as described herein 
our reinsurance operations are managed by the global chief underwriting officer  who leads a team of underwriters  risk modelers and other industry professionals  who have access to our proprietary risk management  underwriting and modeling resources and tools 
we believe the expertise of our underwriting and modeling team and our proprietary analytic tools  together with superior customer service  provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
our portfolio of business has continued to be increasingly characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business  although no current relationship exceeds of our gross premiums written 
accordingly  our gross premiums written are subject to significant fluctuations depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these large customers 
we market our reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through brokers  whose market has become extremely consolidated in recent years 
in  three brokerage firms accounted for of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written 
we believe that recent market dynamics  and trends in our industry in respect of potential future consolidation  have increased our exposure to the risks of broker  client and counterparty concentration 

table of contents the following table shows our total catastrophe and specialty reinsurance gross premiums written year ended december  in thousands renaissance catastrophe premiums renaissance specialty premiums total renaissance premiums davinci catastrophe premiums davinci specialty premiums total davinci premiums total reinsurance premiums total specialty premiums total catastrophe premiums total specialty premiums written includes nil  nil and million premiums assumed from our individual risk segment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
total catastrophe premiums written includes million  million and million of premiums assumed from our individual risk segment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
property catastrophe reinsurance we believe we are one of the largest providers of property catastrophe reinsurance in the world  based on our total catastrophe premium 
our principal property catastrophe reinsurance products include catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance and excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance as described below catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 
we principally write catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis  which means we provide coverage to our insureds when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in a particular contract 
under these contracts  we indemnify an insurer for a portion of the losses on insurance policies in excess of a specified loss amount  and up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
the coverage provided under excess of loss reinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance 
we also write retrocessional reinsurance contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
in providing retrocessional reinsurance  we focus on property catastrophe retrocessional reinsurance  which covers the retrocedant on an excess of loss basis when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril and from a multiple number of reinsureds exceed a specified attachment point 
the coverage provided under excess of loss retrocessional contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected geographic areas 
coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
the information available to retrocessional underwriters concerning the original primary risk can be less precise than the information received from primary companies directly 
moreover  exposures from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant alter their book of business after retrocessional coverage has been bound 
our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally all risk in nature 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism in connection with the coverages we provide 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
we offer our coverages on a worldwide basis 

table of contents because of the wide range of possible catastrophic events to which we are exposed  including the size of such events and because of the potential for multiple events to occur in the same time period  our catastrophe reinsurance business is volatile and our results of operations reflect this volatility 
further  our financial condition may be impacted by this volatility over time or at any point in time 
the effects of claims from one or a number of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on us 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
catastrophe linked securities 
we also invest in catastrophe linked securities cat linked securities 
cat linked securities are generally privately placed fixed income securities as to which all or a portion of the repayment of the principal is linked to catastrophic events  for example  the occurrence of one or more hurricanes or earthquakes producing industry losses exceeding certain specified thresholds 
we underwrite  model  evaluate and monitor these securities using the same tools and techniques used to evaluate our more traditional property catastrophe reinsurance business assumed 
in addition  we may enter into derivative transactions  such as total return swaps  that are based on or referenced to underlying cat linked securities 
based on an evaluation of the specific features of each cat linked security  we account for these securities as reinsurance or at fair value  as applicable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  in future periods we may utilize the growing market for cat linked securities to expand our ceded reinsurance buying if we find the pricing and terms of such coverage attractive 
we seek to moderate the volatility of our risk portfolio through superior risk selection  diversification and the purchase of retrocessional coverages and other protections 
in furtherance of our strategy  we may increase or decrease our presence in the catastrophe reinsurance business based on market conditions and our assessment of risk adjusted pricing adequacy 
we frequently seek to purchase reinsurance or other protection for our own account to further reduce the financial impact that a large catastrophe or a series of catastrophes could have on our results 
as a result of our position in the market and reputation for superior customer service  we believe we have superior access to reinsurance business we view as desirable compared to the market as a whole 
as described above  we use our proprietary underwriting tools and guidelines to attempt to construct an attractive portfolio from these opportunities 
we dynamically model policy submissions against our current in force underwriting portfolio  comparing our estimate of the modeled expected returns of the contract against the amount of capital that we allocate to the contract  based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our overall risk portfolio 
at times  our approach to portfolio management has resulted and may result in the future in our having a relatively large market share of catastrophe reinsurance exposure in a particular geographic region  such as florida  or to a particular peril  such as us hurricane risk  where we believe supply and demand characteristics promote our providing significant capacity  or where the risks or class of risks otherwise adds efficiency to our portfolio 
conversely  from time to time we may have a disproportionately low market share in certain regions or perils where we believe our capital would be less effectively deployed 
specialty reinsurance we write a number of lines of reinsurance other than property catastrophe  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  political risk  trade credit  medical malpractice  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  certain other casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
as with our catastrophe business  our team of experienced professionals seek to underwrite these lines using a disciplined underwriting approach and sophisticated analytical tools 
we generally target lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed and where potential losses could be characterized as low frequency and high severity  similar to our catastrophe reinsurance coverages 
we also seek to identify market dislocations and write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are estimated to exceed our hurdle rates 
we also seek to manage the correlations of this business with our overall portfolio  including our aggregate exposure to single and aggregated catastrophe events 
we believe that our underwriting and analytical capabilities have positioned us well to manage this business 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our catastrophe reinsurance products  and also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance and pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer 
table of contents shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
the reinsurer pays the cedant a commission which is generally based on the cedant s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured including commissions  premium taxes  assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses and may also include a profit factor 
our products frequently include tailored features such as limits or sub limits which we believe help us manage our exposures 
any liability exceeding  or otherwise not subject to  such limits reverts to the cedant 
as with our catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance frequently provides coverage for relatively large limits or exposures  and thus we are subject to potential significant claims volatility 
we generally seek to write significant lines on our specialty reinsurance treaties 
as a result of our financial strength  we have the ability to offer significant capacity and  for select risks  we have made available significant limits 
in  we added experienced underwriting and support executives to our specialty reinsurance unit  and invested in new and enhanced risk management tools and processes 
in addition  we believe that the launch of syndicate will help us grow our market presence over time in respect of select lines of business we find attractive 
while we believe that these and other initiatives will support growth in our specialty reinsurance unit in due course  we intend to continue to apply our disciplined underwriting approach which  together with currently prevailing market conditions  is likely to temper our growth in current and near term term periods 
we believe these capabilities  the strength of our specialty reinsurance underwriting team  and our demonstrated ability and willingness to pay valid claims are competitive advantages of our specialty reinsurance business 
ventures we pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit  which has responsibility for managing our joint venture relationships  executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance 
we also provide customized weather and energy risk management solutions to various customers on a worldwide basis 
property catastrophe managed joint ventures 
we actively manage property catastrophe oriented joint ventures  which provide us with an additional presence in the market  enhance our client relationships and generate fee income 
these joint ventures allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base 
currently  our joint ventures include top layer re and davinci 
renaissance underwriting managers  ltd 
rum  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acts as the exclusive underwriting manager for each of these joint ventures 
davinci was established in and principally writes property catastrophe reinsurance and certain low frequency  high severity specialty reinsurance lines of business on a global basis 
in general  we seek to construct for davinci a property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of renaissance reinsurance s property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio and certain lines of specialty reinsurance such as terrorism and catastrophe exposed workers compensation 
in accordance with davinci s underwriting guidelines  it can only participate in business that is underwritten by renaissance reinsurance 
we maintain majority voting control of davincire and  accordingly  consolidate the results of davincire into our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we seek to manage davinci s capital efficiently over time in light of the market opportunities and needs we perceive and believe we are able to serve 
our ownership in davincire was and at december  and  respectively 
in january  davincire redeemed the shares of certain third party davincire shareholders and in a separate transaction  we sold a portion of our shares in davincire to a third party shareholder 
as a result of these transactions  our ownership interest in davincire increased to 
we expect our ownership in davincire to fluctuate over time 
top layer re writes high excess non us property catastrophe reinsurance 
top layer re is owned by state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm and by renaissance reinsurance  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
state farm provides billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to top layer re 
we account for our equity ownership in top layer re under the equity method of accounting and our proportionate share of its results are reflected in equity in earnings losses of other ventures in our consolidated statements of operations 
during  we formed and launched a new managed joint venture  timicuan reinsurance ii ltd 
tim re ii  which provided additional capacity to the florida property catastrophe market for the wind season 
in conjunction with the formation and launch of tim re ii  million of non voting class b shares were sold to external investors  and we also invested an additional million in tim re ii s non voting class b shares  representing a ownership interest 
we ceded a defined portfolio of property catastrophe excess of loss 
table of contents reinsurance contracts incepting june  to tim re ii under a fully collateralized facultative retrocessional reinsurance contract in return for a potential underwriting profit commission 
the class b shareholders participated in substantially all of the profits or losses of tim re ii while the class b shares remained outstanding 
tim re ii  a wholly owned subsidiary  is considered a variable interest entity and is consolidated by the company 
tim re ii repurchased the class b shares subsequent to december   which was the end of the contract period 
during and  we participated in the formation of starbound reinsurance ii ltd 
starbound ii and starbound reinsurance ltd 
starbound re  respectively 
these joint ventures provided capacity to the us property catastrophe market  primarily for the and us hurricane seasons  respectively 
while these joint ventures were active  we owned a minority interest share of the entities and accounted for them as investments in other ventures  under equity method 
these joint ventures have subsequently terminated and have returned capital to the joint venture shareholders 
effective july  and august   we repurchased all of the issued and outstanding share capital of starbound ii and starbound re  respectively 
we now account for these entities as consolidated subsidiaries 
in addition  during  we sold third party capital in timicuan reinsurance ltd 
tim re to provide additional capacity to accept property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance business for the hurricane season  in return for a profit commission 
in january  the company purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of tim re and now accounts for tim re as a consolidated subsidiary 
ventures works on a range of other customized reinsurance transactions 
for example  we have participated in and continuously analyze  other attractive opportunities in the market for cat linked securities and derivatives 
we believe our products contain a number of customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners  as well as our risk management objectives 
strategic investments 
ventures also pursues strategic investments where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we instead partner with other market participants 
these investments are directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe  and at times may also be directed at non insurance risks 
we find these investments attractive both for their expected returns  and also because they provide us diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market 
examples of these investments include our investments in tower hill insurance group  llc thig  tower hill claims services  llc thcs and tower hill claims management  llc thcm collectively  the tower hill companies  which operate primarily in the state of florida  essent group ltd 
essent and platinum underwriters holdings ltd 
platinum 
thig is a managing general agency specializing in insurance coverage for site built and manufactured homes 
thcs and thcm provide claim adjustment services through exclusive agreements with thig 
during the third quarter of  we invested million in the tower hill companies  representing a ownership interest  to expand our core platforms by obtaining ownership in an additional distribution channel for the florida homeowners market and to enhance our relationships with other stakeholders 
essent provides mortgage insurance and reinsurance coverage for mortgages located in the us platinum is a bermuda domiciled reinsurance company listed on the new york stock exchange 
weather operations 
we undertake weather related consulting activities through our operating companies  principally including weather predict inc weather predict  weatherpredict consulting inc wp consulting and accurate environmental forecasting inc 
aef 
through these subsidiaries we provide fee based consulting services  sell weather related information and forecasts  and engage in education  research and development  and loss mitigation activities  such as the renaissancere wall of wind research facility located in southern florida and the stormstruck interactive weather experience at the walt disney world resort in florida 
weather and energy risk management operations 
we provide energy related risk management solutions and financial products through renaissance trading and real and sell certain financial products primarily to address weather risks  and engage in certain weather  energy and commodity derivatives trading activities 
principally through real  we expect that our participation will increase in the trading markets for securities and derivatives linked to energy  commodities  weather  other natural phenomena  and or products or indices linked in part to such phenomena 
while our activities focus on financial products that allow various energy  utility and other customers to manage their exposures to energy related commodities  we expect our own results in this area to potentially be volatile over time 
as this unit grows  we will seek to continue to invest in operating and control environment systems and procedures  hire staff and develop and install management information and other systems 

table of contents business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  the results of our investments  such as top layer re  and platinum  our weather and energy related activities and other ventures are included in the other category of our segment results 
competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and we believe that competition is increasing and becoming more robust 
our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies  subsidiaries and or affiliates of globally recognized insurance companies  reinsurance divisions of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations  including underwriting syndicates at lloyd s 
as our business evolves over time we expect our competitors to change as well 
in  enhanced competition from new entrants in the reinsurance market appears to have been deferred to a degree due to the issues that faced the capital and credit markets 
however  these issues have somewhat subsided and we anticipate renewed competition from entities such as hedge funds  investment banks  exchanges and other capital market participants that had shown interest over the past several years in entering the reinsurance market 
in addition  we continue to anticipate further  and perhaps accelerating  growth in financial products such as exchange traded catastrophe options  cat linked securities  unrated privately held reinsurance companies providing collateralized reinsurance  catastrophe linked derivative agreements and other financial products  intended to compete with traditional reinsurance 
we believe that competition from non traditional sources such as these will increase in the future 
many of these competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
in addition  the tax policies of the countries where our customers operate  as well as government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds  affect demand for reinsurance 
we are unable to predict the extent to which the foregoing new  proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the risks which may be available for us when providing coverage 

table of contents individual risk segment we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our individual risk segment is managed  effective january  by the global chief underwriting officer 
our individual risk operations seek to identify and write classes of business which we believe to be attractively priced relative to the risk exposure and where our capabilities in modeling  analytical tools and information systems may provide a competitive advantage 
in  our crop insurance business was the most significant contributor to the results of our individual risk segment  as shown in the table below 
we currently expect this relationship to continue in  as a result of factors including expected further softening of market conditions in respect of other lines of primary insurance business we had historically targeted  among other factors 
the following table shows our individual risk gross premiums written by major type of business year ended december  gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written in thousands  except percentages individual risk gross premiums written crop commercial multi line commercial property personal lines property total individual risk gross premiums written our individual risk business is written by renre insurance through its principal operating subsidiaries agro national inc agro national a managing general underwriter of crop insurance that participates in the us federal government s multiple peril crop insurance program mpci  glencoe insurance ltd

our principal contracts currently include insurance policies and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including crop insurance  which includes multi peril crop insurance  crop hail and other named peril agriculture risk management products  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 
our individual risk business is currently produced primarily through four distribution channels wholly owned program managers where we write primary insurance through wholly owned specialized program managers  third party program managers where we write primary insurance through third party specialized program managers  who produce business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide related back office functions  
table of contents quota share reinsurance where we write quota share reinsurance with primary insurers who produce business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide most back office functions  and broker and agent produced business where we write primary insurance produced through licensed intermediaries on a risk by risk basis

the table above is presented as if agro national has been a wholly owned subsidiary since the first period presented 
we underwrite crop insurance primarily through agro national  whose business we acquired in through an asset acquisition  and which previously had been our long term managing general agent  and through stonington  which participates in the us federally sponsored mpci program 
agro national and stonington focus on traditional multi peril crop insurance  crop hail  and other agriculture risk management products  all offered through independent agents 
in  our crop insurance business saw an increase in appointed agents  policy count and insured acres  offset by declines in commodity prices used in determining the policy premium 
in future periods  while we plan to continue to seek operational expansion of our crop insurance business  we anticipate that our gross premiums written will be impacted by our disciplined underwriting approach and subject to fluctuations from a number of factors including the impact of relevant commodity prices  and the potential changes to the sra which may come into effect for the crop insurance underwriting year 
in respect of other lines of business in our individual risk segment  we seek to identify and do business with third party program managers and quota share reinsurance cedants whom we believe utilize superior underwriting methodologies 
we rely on these third parties for services including policy issuance  premium collection  claims processing  and compliance with various state laws and regulations including licensing 
we seek to work closely with these partners  attempting to employ our analytical methodologies and  where appropriate  our expertise in catastrophe risk  to arrive at adequate pricing for the risks being underwritten 
we seek to structure these relationships to provide value to both parties and meaningful protections to us 
historically  our strategy relating to third party program manager relationships has been to pursue a relatively small number of relatively large relationships 
we launched our commercial insurance operations during we actively oversee our third party relationships through a program operations team at renre north america inc and through the use of proprietary tools such as pacer 
our program operations team includes professionals from diverse disciplines 
this group assists with the initial due diligence as well as the ongoing monitoring of these third parties 
our ongoing monitoring includes periodic audits of our third party program managers and third party administrators 
in addition  for our large third party program managers we generally maintain an employee in an underwriting capacity on site at the program manager to oversee the program manager s compliance with our prescribed underwriting guidelines 
we generally seek to have contractual performance standards for each of our programs and third party administrators whose compensation is subject to adjustment based on meeting these standards 
the program operations team audits compliance with our underwriting guidelines and contractually agreed operating guidelines and performance standards 
the program operations team also seeks to ensure corrective action is taken quickly to resolve issues identified during the audit process 

table of contents competition in our individual risk business  we face competition from independent insurance companies  subsidiaries or affiliates of major worldwide companies and others  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
primary insurers compete on the basis of various factors including distribution channels  product  price  service  financial strength and reputation 
in our individual risk business  we compete not only in respect of the insurance and reinsurance products we offer  but in respect of the contractual relationships with the third party program managers with whom we seek to partner 
increased competition in respect of our products could result in decreased premium rates  less attractive terms and conditions  and a decrease in our share of programs we believe to be attractive 
increased competition in respect of our program manager partners  as to whom we seek to be extremely selective and whose relationship we seek to tightly manage in a disciplined  consistent fashion  could result in less favorable terms and conditions in respect of our contractual arrangements with our partners  the loss of existing program manager relationships  or constrain our ability to add new relationships to our operations 
competition in the crop insurance business is also impacted by changes in the terms of the sra or other program alterations implemented by the rma  which could adversely impact the market  and could shift the focus of competition from underwriting and quality services  where we believe our operations to be strong  to other avenues where our ability to compete for customers may be lessened 
in addition  there has been a growing trend of insurance and reinsurance companies acquiring third party program managers 
acquisitions of third party program managers with whom we do business by other insurance or reinsurance companies could result in us losing that program manager relationship 
any of the foregoing could adversely impact the prospects for potential growth and for profitability of our individual risk segment 
ratings financial strength ratings are an important factor in respect of the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies 
rating organizations continually review the financial positions of our reinsurers and insurers 
we continue to receive high claims paying and financial strength ratings from am best co 
am best  standard poor s rating agency s p  moody s and fitch 
these ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations  and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any of our securities

moody s 
moody s insurance financial strength ratings and moody s credit ratings represent its opinions of the ability of insurance companies to pay punctually policyholder claims and obligations and senior unsecured debt instruments 
moody s believes that insurance companies rated a  such as renaissance reinsurance  and companies rated a  such as renaissancere  offer good financial security 
however  moody s believes that elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future 
on november   moody s raised the insurance fsr of renaissance reinsurance to a from a and the senior debt rating of renaissancere to a from baa the outlook is stable for these ratings 
fitch 
fitch ratings ltd 
issuer financial strength ratings provide an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization 
fitch believes that insurance companies rated a  such as renaissance reinsurance  have strong capacity to meet policyholders and contract obligations on a timely basis with a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments 
fitch also provides long term credit ratings  used as a benchmark measure of probability of default  these were formerly described as issuer default ratings 
renaissancere has been rated bbb  meaning there are currently expectations of low credit risk 
while the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures within our reinsurance segment remain among the highest in our business  adverse ratings actions could have a negative effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
in addition  it is common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our customers to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what 
table of contents effect such cancellations would have on the financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
our ratings are subject to periodic review and may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them 
underwriting and enterprise risk management underwriting our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on shareholders equity  subject to prudent risk constraints  and to generate long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends 
we assess each new re insurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk 
reinsurance we have developed a proprietary  computer based pricing and exposure management system  rems 
since inception  we have continued to invest in and improve rems  incorporating our underwriting and modeling experience  additional proprietary software and a significant amount of new industry data 
rems has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
we combine the analyses generated by rems with other information available to us  including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program  to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss and the cost of consumed capital which the program presents 
we utilize a multiple model and multiple risk approach combining both probabilistic and deterministic techniques 
the underlying risk models integrated into our underwriting and rems framework are a combination of internally constructed and commercially available models 
we use commercially available natural hazard catastrophe models to assist with validating and stress testing our base model and rems results 
we continually strive to improve our analytical techniques for both natural hazard and non natural hazard models in rems and while our experience is most developed for analyzing natural hazard catastrophe risks  we continue to make significant advances in our capabilities for assessing non natural hazards catastrophe risks 
we believe that rems is a robust underwriting and risk management system that has been successfully integrated into our business processes and culture 
before we bind a reinsurance risk  exposure data  historical loss information and other risk data is gathered from customers 
the exposure data is input into the rems modeling system and used as a base to create risk distributions to represent the risk being evaluated 
we believe that the rems modeling system helps us to analyze each policy on a consistent basis  assisting our determination of what we believe to be an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk that is assumed 
rems combines computer generated statistical simulations that estimate event probabilities with exposure and coverage information on each client s reinsurance contract to produce expected claims for reinsurance programs submitted to us 
operationally  on a deal by deal basis  our models employ simulation techniques that have the ability to generate  years of loss activity 
when deemed necessary  we stress test the  year simulations with simulations of up to  years 
at a consolidated level  we routinely utilize simulations of  years to incorporate investment risk  expense risk and operational risk at a portfolio and risk assuming entity level 
for natural hazards  we have modeled certain simulated events in excess of billion in insured losses 
from this simulation  we generate a probability distribution of potential outcomes for each policy in our portfolio and for our total portfolio 
in part  through the utilization of rems  we seek to compare our estimate of the expected returns in respect of a contract with the amount of capital that we notionally allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our portfolio of risks 
we have also customized rems by including additional perils  risks and geographic areas that may not be captured in the commercially available models 
we periodically review the estimates and assumptions that are reflected in rems and our other tools 
for example  in the second half of we assessed recent us geological survey research updates and independently evaluated and revised our assumptions relating to us earthquake risks 
in  we revised our assumptions on atlantic basin hurricane frequency and severity 
the publicly available commercial catastrophe models historically base their frequency and severity distributions on the last years of hurricane activity  assuming that this time frame is an appropriate framework on which to base estimates of the hurricane risk to which the insurance industry is exposed 
we currently do not believe  based on our review of the scientific literature  private research  and discussions with climatologists  meteorologists and other weather scientists  including those at weather predict  that the past years of data is reflective of current climatological risks 
in 
table of contents particular  we believe there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes that have the potential to make landfall in the us  potentially as a result of decadal ocean water temperature cyclical trends  a longer term trend towards global warming  or both or other factors 
we started using these revised assumptions in rems to model and evaluate our portfolio of risk in the latter part of  whereas commercially available models did not release updated models until late the process of updating all of the underlying risk models is continuous  and many of the assumptions involve significant judgment on our part  and further experience or scientific research may lead us to further adjust these assumptions 
changes in our modeled assumptions may impact from time to time the amount of capacity we are prepared to offer 
our catastrophe reinsurance underwriters use rems in their pricing decisions  which we believe provides them with several competitive advantages 
these include the ability to simulate a range of potential outcomes that adequately represents the risk to an individual contract  to analyze the incremental impact of an individual reinsurance contract on our overall portfolio  to better assess the underlying exposures associated with assumed retrocessional business  to price contracts within a short time frame  to capture various classes of risk  including catastrophe and other insurance risks  to assess risk across multiple entities including our various joint ventures and across different components of our capital structure  and to provide consistent pricing information 
as part of our risk management process  we also use rems to assist us with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account 
our underwriting and risk management process  in conjunction with rems  quantifies and manages our exposure to claims from any single catastrophic event and the exposure to losses from a series of catastrophic events 
as part of our pricing and underwriting process  we also assess a variety of other factors  including the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long term relationship with the cedant  the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share  historical loss data for the cedant and  where available  for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions  in order to compare the cedant s historical catastrophe loss experience to industry averages  the cedant s pricing strategies  and the perceived financial strength of the cedant 
in order to estimate the risk profile of each line of non natural hazard reinsurance ie lines of business within our specialty unit  we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio 
in lines with catastrophe risk  such as excess workers compensation and terrorism  we are directly leveraging our skill in modeling for our property catastrophe reinsurance risks  and seek to appropriately estimate and manage the correlations between these specialty lines and our catastrophe reinsurance portfolio 
for other classes of business  in which we believe we have little or no natural catastrophe exposure  and therefore less correlation with our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  we derive probability distributions from a variety of underlying information sources  including recent historical experience  and the application of judgment as appropriate 
the nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis that we use for our property catastrophe reinsurance coverages  reflecting both the nature of available exposure information  and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure 
we produce probability distributions to represent our estimates of the related underlying risks which our products cover  which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions and to manage our total risk portfolio 
individual risk for our catastrophe exposed business in our individual risk segment  we generally seek to utilize proprietary modeling tools similar to those that have been developed in our reinsurance operations  as described above 
we have modified these tools to create proprietary ways to price and understand risk on a primary insurance level 
we also combine these analyses with those of our reinsurance segment to monitor our aggregate group catastrophic exposures 
although we have made significant investments in our systems  tools and procedures for our individual risk operations  we do not believe these to be as developed as our underwriting systems for our reinsurance operations 

table of contents for the business produced through third party program managers  we combine an evaluation process with ongoing periodic auditing and monitoring for those program managers that we utilize 
when evaluating a potential new program manager  we consider numerous factors including i whether the program manager can provide and help us analyze historic loss and other business data  ii whether the program manager has the ability to provide us with appropriately detailed information about the risks being assumed so that we can adequately analyze and model the portfolio  iii whether the program manager will agree to accept a portion of their compensation based on the underwriting performance of their program and provide us with the other terms and conditions we require  iv whether the program manager has the infrastructure to process the business produced for us  v our assessment of the integrity and experience of the program manager s management team  vi the potential profitability of the program to us  and vii the availability of our internal resources to appropriately execute transaction terms  and provide the ongoing monitoring we require 
in considering pricing for the products to be offered by the program manager  we evaluate the expected frequency and severity of losses  the costs of providing the necessary coverage including the cost of administering policy benefits  claims handling expenses  sales and other administrative and overhead costs  and the necessity of third party reinsurance 
all of these factors are evaluated to develop both a stand alone view on expected profitability over the life of the program  as well as the marginal effect on the overall portfolio of risk being assumed by the company 
we provide our third party program managers with written underwriting guidelines and seek to regularly monitor their compliance with our guidelines 
also  our contracts generally provide that a portion of the commission payable to our third party program managers will be on a retrospective basis  which is intended to permit us to adjust commissions based on our profitability and claims experience as they develop 
we rely on our third party program managers to perform underwriting pursuant to these contractual guidelines  and believe we benefit from their proximity to the customer  developed distribution channels and expertise in niche areas 
in addition to utilizing rems within our individual risk operations  we have developed a proprietary information management and analytical database  pacer 
all policy  claims and risk data for each program is housed within this database 
we use this data for a range of activities  including but not limited to exposure weighted price monitoring  peak zone exposure management  predictive analytics  actuarial analyses  new product development  claims operations management  and accounting 
by compiling this detailed data over time we hope to create a competitive advantage 
in our crop insurance business  we have invested in an experienced team of crop  commodity and economic analysts who have developed proprietary tools to manage risk  pricing and exposure in this business 
these proprietary tools are constructed from databases that involve a comprehensive set of historical profit and loss experience data developed at a crop  state  and in some cases  county and farm level of detail 
we augment this with stochastic simulation techniques similar to those used in our property catastrophe reinsurance business and also incorporate proprietary weather forecast information to support our efforts to build a portfolio of risks we estimate to have a likelihood of producing attractive returns based on modeled outcomes 
enterprise risk management we have sought to develop and utilize a series of tools and processes that support a robust system of erm within our organization 
we consider erm to be a key process  managed by our senior executive team under the oversight of our board of directors  and implemented by personnel from across our organization 
we believe that erm helps us to identify potential events that may affect us  to quantify  evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed  and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives 
we believe that effective erm can provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
we also believe that effective erm assists our efforts to minimize the likelihood of suffering financial outcomes in excess of the ranges which we have estimated in respect of specific investments  underwriting decisions  or other operating or business activities 
we believe that our risk management tools support our strategy of pursuing opportunities and help us to identify opportunities that we believe to be the most attractive 
in particular  we utilize our risk management tools to support our efforts to monitor our capital position  on a consolidated basis and for each of our major operating subsidiaries  and to allocate an appropriate amount of capital to support the risks that we have assumed in the aggregate and for each of our major operating subsidiaries 
we believe that our risk management efforts are essential to our corporate strategy and our goal of achieving long term growth in tangible book value per share plus the change in accumulated dividends for our shareholders 

table of contents our erm framework comprises three primary areas of focus  as set forth below assumed risk 
we define assumed risk as all activities where we deliberately take risk against the company s capital base  including underwriting risks and other quantifiable risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk as they relate to investments  ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment risk  each of which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques 
of these  we believe underwriting risk to be the most material to us 
in order to understand  monitor  quantify and proactively assess underwriting risk  we seek to develop and deploy appropriate tools to  among other things  estimate the comparable expected returns on potential business opportunities  and estimate the impact that such incremental business could have on our overall risk profile 
we use the tools and methods described above in underwriting to seek to achieve these objectives 
embedded within our consideration of assumed risk is our management of the company s aggregate risk profile 
in part through the utilization of rems and our other systems and procedures  we seek to analyze our in force aggregate assumed risk portfolio on a daily basis 
we believe this capability helps us to manage our aggregate exposures  as well as to rigorously analyze individual proposed transactions and evaluate them in the context of our in force portfolio 
this aggregation process captures line of business  segment and corporate risk profiles  calculates internal and external capital tests and explicitly models ceded reinsurance 
generally  additional data is added quarterly to our aggregate risk framework to reflect updated or new information or estimates relating to matters such as interest rate risk  credit risk  capital adequacy and liquidity 
this information is used in day to day decision making for underwriting  investments and operations and is also reviewed quarterly from both a unit level and in respect of our consolidated financial position 
business environment risk 
we define this as the risk of changes in the business  political or regulatory environment that could negatively impact our short term or long term financial results or the markets in which we operate 
accordingly  these risks are predominately extrinsic to the company and in general  our ability to alter or eliminate these risks is limited 
rather  our efforts focus on monitoring developments  assessing potential impacts of any such changes  and investing in cost effective means to attempt to mitigate the consequences of and ensure compliance with any new requirements applicable to us 
operational risk 
we believe we are subject to a number of additional risks arising out of operational  regulatory  and other matters 
we define operational risk as the risk that we fail to create  manage  control or mitigate the people  processes  structures or functions required to execute our strategic and tactical plans and assemble an optimized portfolio of assumed risk  and to adjust to and comply with the evolving requirements of business environment risk applicable to us 
in light of the rapid evolution of our markets  business environment  and business initiatives  we seek to continually invest in the tools  processes and procedures to cost effectively mitigate our exposure to operational risk 
identification and monitoring of business environment risk and operational risk is coordinated by senior personnel including our chief financial officer cfo  general counsel and chief compliance officer cco  corporate controller and chief accounting officer cao  chief administrative officer  chief risk officer cro and internal audit  utilizing resources within the company 
in an effort to identify and reduce operational and regulatory risk  we have significantly enhanced our control environment and have added additional finance  legal and back office resources  to keep pace with the rate of growth experienced by the company and will continue to do so in the future as appropriate 
for example we have developed and expanded the compliance and internal audit functions  the accounting function has been strengthened by the addition of a significant number of professionals  accounting  legal and or compliance resources have been placed in our business units to monitor  identify and resolve potential accounting  legal and compliance needs at the operational level  and we have documented accounting guidelines for the review of all non standard reinsurance contracts and other structured and or complex financial transactions 
although financial reporting is a key area of our focus  other operational risks are addressed through our disaster recovery program  human resource practices such as motivating and retaining top talent  and our strict compliance with legal and tax protocols 

table of contents controls and compliance committee 
we believe that a key component of our current operational risk management platform is our controls and compliance committee 
the controls and compliance committee is comprised of our cfo  cco  cao  chief administrative officer  cro  staff compliance professionals and representatives from our business units 
the purpose of the controls and compliance committee is to establish  assess the effectiveness of  and enforce policies  procedures and practices relating to accounting  financial reporting  internal controls  regulatory  legal  compliance and related matters  for ensuring compliance with applicable laws  regulations  the company s code of ethics and conduct  and other relevant standards 
in addition  the controls and compliance committee is charged with reviewing certain transactions that potentially contain complex and or significant underwriting  tax  legal  accounting  regulatory  reputational or compliance issues 
ongoing development and enhancement 
we frequently seek to accurately capture  reflect and categorize risks we monitor in part through quantitative risk distributions  even where we believe that such quantitative analysis is not as robust or well developed as our tools and models for measuring and evaluating other risks  such as catastrophe and market risks 
we also seek to improve the methods by which we measure risks 
we believe effective risk management is a core attribute of our culture and is a continual process that requires ongoing improvement and development 
we seek from time to time to identify new best practices or additional developments both from within our industry and from other sectors 
we believe that our ongoing efforts to embed erm throughout our organization are important to our efforts to produce and maintain a competitive advantage to achieve our corporate goals 
geographic breakdown our exposures are generally diversified across geographic zones  but are also a function of market conditions and opportunities 
the company s largest exposure has historically been to the us and caribbean property catastrophe market  which represented of the company s gross premiums written for the year ended december  a significant amount of our us and caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms  mainly us atlantic hurricanes  as well as earthquakes and other natural and man made catastrophes 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our gross premiums written allocated to the territory of coverage exposure year ended december  gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written gross premiums written percentage of gross premiums written in thousands  except percentages property catastrophe reinsurance united states and caribbean worldwide excluding u 
s europe worldwide australia and new zealand other specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total gross premiums written the category worldwide excluding us consists of contracts that cover more than one geographic region other than the us the exposure in this category for gross premiums written to date is predominantly from europe and japan 
the category specialty reinsurance consists of contracts that are predominantly exposed to us and  to a lesser extent  worldwide risks 

table of contents excludes million  million and million of premium assumed from our individual risk segment in  and  respectively 
the category individual risk consists of contracts that are primarily exposed to us risks 
reserves for claims and claim expenses we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 
the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total our gross claims and claim expense reserves decreased million in  from billion at december  to billion at december   as shown in the table above 
the decrease was driven by million of claims and claims expenses incurred during  including million of current accident year claims and claim expenses  which was more than offset by a million reduction of prior accident year claims and claim expenses and million of paid losses during the paid losses in include million of losses on current accident year claims and claim reserves and million on prior accident year claims and claims expense reserves 
our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments that cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the year ended december   changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million million  million  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax expense 

table of contents our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
we recorded million of gross claims and claim expenses incurred in the third quarter of as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the united states us in the third quarter of our estimates of losses from hurricanes gustav and ike are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain customers and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
given the magnitude and relatively recent occurrence of these events  as well as the large storms of  including hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  our actual net losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by customers and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
refer to our claims and claim expense reserves critical accounting estimates discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units 
the following table represents the development of our gaap balance sheet reserves for december  through december  this table does not present accident or policy year development data 
the top line of the table shows the gross reserves for claims and claim expenses at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years

the remaining favorable development within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit was due to a reduction of ultimate net losses on a variety of smaller catastrophes such as hail storms  winter freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes which occurred during the through accident years 
the favorable development within our specialty reinsurance unit of million in was principally attributable to lower than expected claims emergence on the through underwriting years of million which was driven by the application of our formulaic actuarial reserving methodology for this business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being more favorable to date than what was originally anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves  million due to a reduction on one claim on a contract related to the hurricanes  and partially offset by a million increase in our estimated ultimate net losses on the madoff matter 
the adverse development within our individual risk segment of million in was principally driven by million of adverse development in our crop insurance business primarily due to an increase in the severity of reported loss activity in on the crop year

for the year ended december   the prior year favorable development of million included million attributable to our reinsurance segment and million attributable to our individual risk segment 
within our reinsurance segment  the catastrophe reinsurance unit experienced favorable development on prior years estimated ultimate claim reserves of million  principally as a result of a comprehensive review of the company s expected ultimate net losses associated with the hurricanes  katrina  rita and wilma  which resulted in an million decrease in net losses from these events 
the comprehensive review of the hurricanes included a case by case review of the claims for our largest outstanding additional case reserves by cedant for each hurricane  reviewing updated information received from customers  brokers and other industry sources regarding these claims  reviewing industry paid and reported loss development patterns for hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and comparing these statistics to our paid and reported loss development patterns for these events  and reviewing our historical experience for previous large catastrophes  including the hurricanes 
based on the work completed  we determined to reduce our current best estimate of the ultimate net losses arising from these events by million 
the million decrease in ultimate net losses was comprised of a million decrease in additional case reserves and a million decrease in ibnr and partially offset by a corresponding million decrease in losses recoverable 
we did not change our reserving methodology as a result of this review 
our specialty reinsurance unit  within the reinsurance segment  and our individual risk segment experienced million and million  respectively  of favorable development in the favorable development within our specialty reinsurance unit and individual risk segment was principally driven by the application of our formulaic actuarial reserving methodology for these books of business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being more favorable to date than what was originally anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves

marketing reinsurance we believe that our modeling and technical expertise  the risk management advice that we provide to our customers  and our reputation for paying claims promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide 
we market our reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through reinsurance brokers and we focus our marketing efforts on targeted brokers 
we believe that our existing portfolio of business is a valuable asset and  therefore  we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and customers 
we target prospects that are capable of supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business 
we believe that primary insurers and brokers willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing  but also on the financial security of the reinsurer  its claim paying ability ratings and demonstrated willingness to promptly pay valid claims  the quality of a reinsurer s service  the reinsurer s willingness and ability to design customized programs  its long term stability and its commitment to provide reinsurance capacity 
we believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and customers for prompt response on underwriting submissions  fast claims payments and a reputation for providing creative solutions to our customers needs 
since we selectively write large lines on a limited number of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts  we can establish reinsurance terms and conditions on those contracts that are attractive in our judgment  make large commitments to the most attractive programs and provide superior client responsiveness 
we believe that our willingness and ability to design customized programs and to provide advice on catastrophe risk management has helped us to develop long term relationships with brokers and customers 
our reinsurance brokers assess client needs and perform data collection  contract preparation and other administrative tasks  enabling us to market our reinsurance products cost effectively by maintaining a smaller staff 
we believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers  we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds 
in recent years  our distribution has become increasingly reliant on a small number 
table of contents of such relationships  a trend which we believe was accelerated by the merger of aon and benfield in we expect this concentration to continue and perhaps increase

the table above is presented as if agro national has been a wholly owned subsidiary since the first period presented 
the business produced through third party program managers  quota share reinsurance and broker produced business principally comes to us through intermediaries 
our financial security ratings  combined with our reputation in the reinsurance marketplace  including the long standing relationships we have developed with our reinsurance intermediaries  have enhanced our presence in our individual risk markets 
with respect to our program business  we believe that our strategy of establishing strong relationships and assisting our partners with modeling  risk analysis and other expertise has helped us to develop a favorable reputation in this market 
we believe that our existing third party program managers are an important source of referrals and endorsements of our approach to this business 
in addition  we acquired the net assets of agro national  llc in june  a managing general underwriter of crop insurance  and believe our direct ownership of this operation will facilitate our pursuit of additional opportunities in the crop insurance and agricultural products markets

spectrum partners  the parent company of spectrum syndicate management ltd 
spectrum  the lloyd s managing agency for syndicate  and by the addition of resources in  among others  our accounting  legal  information technology and risk management functions  as well as certain of our operating business units 
we believe that our employee headcount is likely to continue to increase over time as the company expands geographically  and seeks to enter new lines of business 
we expect that our employee growth in the us  us and other highly regulated markets will increase our operating and compliance complexity and expenses  although we do not expect these increases to be material to the company as a whole 
information technology our information technology infrastructure is important to our business 
our information technology platform  supported by a team of professionals  is currently principally located in our corporate headquarters and principal corporate offices in bermuda 
additional information technology assets are maintained at the office locations of our operating subsidiaries 
we have implemented backup procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems and data are backed up  generally on a daily basis  and can be restored promptly if and as needed 
in addition  we generally store backup information at off site locations  in order to seek to minimize our risk of loss of key data in the event of a disaster 
we have implemented and periodically test our disaster recovery plans with respect to our information technology infrastructure 
among other things  our recovery plans involve arrangements with off site  secure data centers in alternative locations 
we believe we will be able to access our systems from these facilities in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to a scenario such as a natural disaster 
regulation us regulation reinsurance regulation 
our bermuda domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures principally consist of renaissance reinsurance  davinci  top layer re  glencoe and lantana 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are bermuda based companies that operate as reinsurers 
although none of these companies is admitted to transact the business of insurance in any jurisdiction except bermuda  the insurance laws of each state of the us regulate the sale of reinsurance to ceding insurers authorized in the state by non admitted alien reinsurers  such as renaissance reinsurance or davinci  acting from locations outside the state 
rates  contract terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any governmental authority 
a primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement  however  only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its statutory financial statements 
in general  regulators permit ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance under the following circumstances if the contract contains certain minimum provisions if the reinsurer is licensed or accredited  if the reinsurer is domiciled in a state with substantially similar regulatory requirements as the primary insurer s domiciliary jurisdiction and meets certain financial requirements  or if the reinsurance obligations are collateralized appropriately 

table of contents as alien companies  our bermuda subsidiaries collateralize their reinsurance obligations to us insurance companies 
with some exceptions  the sale of insurance or reinsurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited 
none of renaissance reinsurance  davinci or top layer re intends to maintain an office or to solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any jurisdiction  other than bermuda  where the conduct of such activities would require that each company be so admitted 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted a framework to modernize the current us reinsurance regulatory framework 
as a first step toward implementation of the framework  the naic developed a draft federal bill entitled the reinsurance regulatory modernization act of the rrma and sought congressional sponsors of the rrma 
the rrma failed to find congressional support as portions of the proposal were opposed by domestic reinsurers and the us department of the treasury 
therefore  the naic is refocusing its attention on credit for reinsurance reforms 
the rrma contemplates credit for reinsurance collateral levels from to based on the ratings assigned to reinsurers 
accordingly  the rrma  if promulgated  may lead to a reduction of the collateral requirements for non us reinsurers  which could be beneficial to our bermuda subsidiaries 
certain individual states have moved forward with initiatives for similar revised collateral requirements as well 
at this time  we are unable to determine how such changes in the us reinsurance regulatory framework will be implemented and the effect  if any  such changes would have on our operations or financial condition 
excess and surplus lines regulation 
glencoe and lantana  domiciled in bermuda  are not licensed in the us but are eligible to offer coverage in the us exclusively in the surplus lines market 
glencoe and lantana are each eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance in us states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  and each is subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which it is eligible to write surplus lines primary insurance 
in accordance with certain provisions of the naic nonadmitted insurance model act  which provisions have been adopted by a number of states  glencoe and lantana have each established  and are required to maintain  a trust funded to a minimum amount as a condition of its status as an eligible  non admitted insurer in the us although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements under the laws of every state  and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal and or state measures may be introduced and promulgated that would result in increased oversight and regulation of surplus lines insurance 
for example  the nonadmitted and reinsurance reform act of nrra  which would create uniform standards for surplus lines insurer eligibility  as well as create a uniform system of placement and premium tax allocation for multistate surplus lines risks and surplus lines broker licensing  passed the house of representatives earlier this year and is awaiting action in the senate 
in  the florida supreme court held that surplus lines insurers were subject to insurance law provisions governing policy delivery  policy forms  the payment of attorney fees and other matters  however  in  the florida legislature passed fl sb and hb to clarify the limited applicability of florida insurance law to surplus lines insurers exempt from the provisions governing policy delivery  policy forms  etc this case could foreshadow more extensive oversight of surplus lines insurance by other jurisdictions 
any increase in our regulatory burden may impact our operations and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
admitted market regulation 
our admitted us insurance company operations currently consist of stonington and stonington lloyds  both texas domiciled insurers 
stonington is licensed to write primary insurance in states and the district of columbia 
stonington lloyds is a texas lloyds company licensed to write primary insurance in texas 
stonington acts as an attorney in fact for stonington lloyds 
as licensed insurers operating in the admitted market  these companies are subject to extensive regulation 
the extent of regulation varies from state to state but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state 
among other things  state insurance statutes require insurance companies to file financial statements  conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and regulate insurer solvency standards  insurer licensing  authorized investments  premium rates  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy  loss and expense reserves and provisions for unearned premiums  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  policy form approval  policy renewals and non renewals  and market conduct regulation including both underwriting and claims practices 
licensed us insurers are required to participate in various state residual market mechanisms whose goal is to provide affordability and availability of insurance to those consumers who may not otherwise be able to obtain insurance 
the mechanics of how each state s residual markets operate may differ  but generally  risks are either assigned to various private carriers or the state manages the risk through a pooling arrangement 
if losses exceed 
table of contents the funds the pool has available to pay those losses  the pools have the ability to assess insurers to provide additional funds to the pool 
the amounts of the assessment for each company are normally based upon the proportion of each insurer s and in some cases the insurer s and its affiliates written premium for coverages similar to those provided by the pool  and are frequently uncapped 
state guaranty associations also have the ability to assess licensed us insurers in order to provide funds for payment of losses for insurers which have become insolvent 
in many cases  but not all  assessed insurers may recoup the amount of these guaranty fund and state pool assessments by surcharging future policyholders 
holding company regulation 
we and our us insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various jurisdictions 
the insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but generally require an insurance holding company  and insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies  to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports  including information concerning their capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
in addition  under the terms of applicable state statutes  any person or entity obtaining beneficial ownership of with certain limited exceptions or more of our outstanding voting securities is required to apply for and receive prior regulatory approval for such acquisition  and our us insurance company subsidiaries are required to report ownership changes to their domiciliary regulator 
further  in order to protect insurance company solvency  state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to affiliates by insurance companies 
the naic is studying the need for group wide supervision of insurance holding company systems  which may include group wide capital requirements 
such group solvency initiatives may result in changes to the state holding company statutes increasing direct state supervision over insurance holding companies 
naic ratios 
the naic has established financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed us insurance companies operating in their respective states 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris calculates these ratios based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments 
each ratio has an established usual range of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
a ratio result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios is not considered a failing result  rather unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system 
furthermore  in some years  it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges 
an insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial 
generally  an insurance company will be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges with respect to four or more of the ratios 
risk based capital 
the naic has implemented a risk based capital rbc formula and model law applicable to all licensed us property casualty insurance companies 
the rbc formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business 
such analysis permits regulators to identify inadequately capitalized insurers 
the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory capital by applying certain factors to insurers business risks such as asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer s size  but also on the risk profile of the insurer s operations 
insurers that have less statutory capital than the rbc calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy 
the rbc formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with higher levels of capital 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank such companies 
legislative and regulatory proposals 
government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets in the us continues to evolve 
although us state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance  congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to potential surplus lines regulation  reinsurance regulation  the creation of an optional federal charter  the creation of a systemic risk regulator  repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act  and tax law changes  including changes to increase the taxation of reinsurance premiums paid to off shore affiliates with respect to us risks 
none of these proposals were adopted by the th congress before it adjourned 
the th congress has picked up several of these insurance related initiatives  and in addition  is currently considering a bill that would create a federal insurance office fio within the department of treasury 
the fio would have oversight over all lines of insurance except health insurance and would report annually to the 
table of contents congress 
although we are unable to predict whether the fio proposal or any other proposed laws and regulations will be adopted  or the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted  we believe it is more likely than at times in the past that the current congress will adopt laws and or regulations with respect to insurance  and we anticipate that these developments will impact our operations and also could impact our financial condition 
in addition to potential new insurance industry regulation  the obama administration and congress are also considering various regulatory reforms for the financial markets  including potentially as it pertains to the re insurance industry 
we are unable to predict what reforms will be proposed or adopted or the effect  if any  that such reforms would have on our operations and financial condition 
we are carefully monitoring such developments 
in  florida enacted legislation which enabled the fhcf to offer increased amounts of coverage in addition to the mandatory coverage amount  at below market rates 
further  the legislation expanded the ability of the state sponsored insurer  citizens  to compete with private insurance companies  such as ours and other companies that cede business to us 
this legislation reduced the role of the private insurance and reinsurance markets in florida  a key target market of ours 
in may  the florida legislature took steps to strengthen the financial condition of fhcf and citizens  which a government appointed task force determined have been impaired by  issues including the crisis in the credit markets  widespread rate inadequacy  and issues arising out of the application of discounts for housing retrofits and mitigation features 
a bill was passed in that would permit citizens to raise its rates by up to starting in and every year thereafter until its current shortfall is corrected and citizens has sufficient funds to pay its claims and expenses 
this legislation also increased the rates for fhcf and incremental staged reductions in the amount of its coverage 
it is possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on some version of the earlier florida precedent  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
for example  in the past  federal bills have been proposed in congress and  in  passed by the house of representatives which would  if enacted  create a federal reinsurance backstop or guarantee mechanism for catastrophic risks  including those we currently insure and reinsure in the private markets 
in the catastrophe obligation guarantee act was introduced in the senate and house s 
the coga to federally guarantee bond issuances by certain government entities  potentially including the fhcf  the texas windstorm insurance association  the california earthquake authority  and others 
similar legislation has been introduced in the house of representatives 
if enacted  this legislation  or legislation similar to these proposals  would  we believe  likely contribute to growth of these state entities or to their inception or alteration in a manner adverse to us 
while none of this legislation has been enacted to date  and although we believe such legislation would be vigorously opposed if introduced in  if enacted these bills would likely further erode the role of private market catastrophe reinsurers and could adversely impact our financial results  perhaps materially 
the potential for further expansion into additional insurance markets  could expose us or our subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight  including the oversight of countries other than bermuda and the us however  we intend to continue to conduct our operations so as to minimize the likelihood that renaissance reinsurance  davinci  top layer re  glencoe  lantana  or any of our other bermudian subsidiaries will become subject to direct us regulation 
in addition  as discussed above  real and renaissance trading are involved in certain commodities trading activities relating to weather  natural gas  heating oil  power  crude oil  agricultural commodities and cross commodity structures 
while real s and renaissance trading s operations currently are not subject to significant federal oversight  we are monitoring carefully new or revised legislation or regulation in the us or otherwise  which could increase the regulatory burden and operating expenses of these operations 

table of contents bermuda regulation all bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the companies act in addition  the insurance act  and related regulations the insurance act  regulates the business of our bermuda insurance  reinsurance and management company subsidiaries 
as a holding company  renaissancere is not currently subject to the insurance act 
however  the insurance act regulates the insurance and reinsurance business of our operating insurance companies 
the company s most significant operating subsidiaries include renaissance reinsurance and davinci which are registered as class general business insurers and glencoe  lantana  and top layer re which are registered as class a general business insurers under the insurance act 
rum is registered as an insurance manager 
the insurance act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements and confers on the bermuda monetary authority bma powers to supervise  investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
significant requirements of the insurance act include the appointment of an independent auditor and loss reserve specialist both of whom must be approved by the bma  the filing of an annual financial return and provisions relating to the payment of distributions and dividends 
in particular an insurer must prepare annual statutory financial statements which must be submitted as part of its statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer s financial year end unless specifically extended 
the annual statutory financial statements give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance  reserves and investments 
the statutory financial return includes  among other items  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements  a declaration of statutory ratios  a solvency certificate  the statutory financial statements themselves  the opinion of the approved loss reserve specialist  and  in the case of class insurers  details concerning ceded reinsurance 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the bma 
in addition to preparing statutory financial statements  effective december   all class insurers must prepare financial statements in respect of their insurance business in accordance with gaap or ifrs 
an insurer s statutory assets must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin which varies with the category of its registration and net premiums written and loss reserves posted minimum solvency margin 
the minimum solvency margin that must be maintained by a class insurer is the greater of i million  or ii of net premiums written with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding of gross premiums or iii of net discounted aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
the minimum solvency margin for a class a insurer is the greater of i million  or ii of the first million of net premiums written  if in excess of million  the figure is million plus of net premiums written in excess of million  or iii of net discounted aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves 
in addition  each class insurer must maintain its capital at a level equal to its enhanced capital requirement ecr which is established by reference to the bermuda solvency capital requirement bscr model which came into force in to assist the bma to better assess the adequacy of a class insurer s capital 
alternatively  under the insurance act  insurers may  subject to the terms of the insurance act and to the bma s oversight  elect to utilize an approved internal capital model to determine regulatory capital 
the bma believes that use of an internal model to substantiate the required regulatory capital requirement may in many circumstances better reflect a specific insurer s particular business profile than a market wide regulatory model 
an insurer s internal model must satisfy certain criteria to be approved for the determination of regulatory capital 
in either case  the ecr shall at all times equal or exceed the class insurer s minimum solvency margin and may be adjusted in circumstances where the bma concludes that the insurer s risk profile deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying its ecr or the insurer s assessment of its risk management policies and practices used to calculate the ecr applicable to it 
an insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than of the amount of its relevant liabilities minimum liquidity ratio 

table of contents both class a and class general business insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if in breach of the required minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio the relevant margins or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the relevant margins 
where an insurer fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year  it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the prior approval of the bma 
further  a class insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files at least seven days before payment of such dividends with the bma an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its relevant margins 
class a and class insurers must obtain the bma s prior approval for a reduction by or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year s financial statements 
these restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the insurance act are in addition to the solvency requirements under the companies act which apply to all bermuda companies 
if the bma believes that an investigation is required in the interests of an insurer s policyholders or persons who may become policyholders  it may appoint an inspector who has extensive powers of investigation 
if it appears to the bma to be desirable in the interests of policyholders  the bma may also exercise these powers in relation to holding companies  subsidiaries and other affiliates of insurers 
if it appears to the bma that there is a risk of an insurer becoming insolvent  or that the insurer is in breach of the insurance act or any conditions of its registration  the bma may exercise extensive powers of intervention including directing the insurer not to take on any new insurance business or prohibiting the company from declaring and paying dividends or other distributions 
any person who  directly or indirectly  becomes a beneficial owner of at least   or of the voting shares of an insurer or its parent company must notify the bma in writing within days that he has become such an owner 
where it appears to the bma that a person who is a controller of any description of a registered person is not or is no longer a fit and proper person to be such a controller  it may serve him with a written notice of objection to his being such a controller of the registered person 
under the provisions of the insurance act  the bma may  from time to time  conduct on site visits at the offices of insurers it regulates 
the bma may cancel an insurer s registration on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including without limitation  i the failure of that insurer to comply with its obligations under the insurance act or ii the failure of that insurer in the opinion of the bma to carry on its business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
uk regulation lloyd s regulation general 
the operations of renaissancere syndicate management ltd 
rsml  formerly known as spectrum  are franchised by lloyd s 
the lloyd s franchise board was formally constituted on january  the franchise board is responsible for setting risk management and profitability targets for the lloyd s market and operates a business planning and monitoring process for all syndicates 
rsml s business plan for syndicate requires annual approval by the lloyd s franchise board  including maximum underwriting capacity  and may require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan 
lloyd s also imposes various charges and assessments on its members 
if material changes in the business plan for syndicate were required by lloyd s  or if charges and assessments payable by renaissancere corporate capital uk limited renaissancere ccl to lloyd s were to increase significantly  these events could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial results of rsml 
the company has provided capital to lloyd s to support renaissancere ccl s underwriting business at lloyd s 
dividends from a lloyd s managing agent and a lloyd s corporate member can be declared and paid provided the relevant company has sufficient profits available for distribution 
by entering into a membership agreement with lloyd s  renaissancere ccl undertakes to comply with all lloyd s bye laws and regulations as well as the provisions of the lloyd s acts and the financial services and markets act the fsma that are applicable to it 

table of contents capital requirements 
the underwriting capacity of a member of lloyd s must be supported by providing a deposit referred to as funds at lloyd s in the form of cash  securities or letters of credit in an amount determined under the individual capital adequacy regime of the uk s financial services authority the fsa 
the amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise 
under these requirements  lloyd s must demonstrate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin 
restrictions 
a reinsurance to close ritc is put in place after the third year of operations of a syndicate year of account 
if the lloyd s managing agency concludes that an appropriate ritc for a syndicate that it manages cannot be determined or negotiated on commercially acceptable terms in respect of a particular underwriting year  it must determine that the underwriting year remain open and be placed into run off 
during this period there cannot be a release of the funds at lloyd s of a corporate member that is a member of that syndicate without the consent of lloyd s and such consent will only be considered where the member has surplus funds at lloyd s 
the financial security of the lloyd s market is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies am best  s p and fitch 
a satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency is necessary for lloyd s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels 
rsml and renaissancere ccl would be adversely affected if lloyd s current ratings were downgraded 
intervention powers 
the council of lloyd s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members underwriting at lloyd s 
it may  for instance  change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the funds at lloyd s or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of funds at lloyd s 
exercising any of these powers might affect the return on an investment of the corporate member in a given underwriting year 
if a member of lloyd s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders  such debts may be payable by the lloyd s central fund  which in many respects acts as an equivalent to a state guaranty fund in the us if lloyd s determines that the central fund needs to be increased  it has the power to assess premium levies on current lloyd s members 
the council of lloyd s has discretion to call or assess up to of a member s underwriting capacity in any one year as a central fund contribution 
lloyd s approval is also required before any person can acquire control as defined below in relation to the fsma and giving prior notification to the fsa of a lloyd s managing agent or lloyd s corporate member 
fsa regulation rsml s operations are regulated by the fsa as well as being franchised by lloyd s of london 
the fsa has substantial powers of intervention in relation to the lloyd s managing agents  such as rsml  which it regulates  including the power to remove their authorization to manage lloyd s syndicates 
in addition  each year the fsa requires lloyd s to satisfy an annual solvency test which measures whether lloyd s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members  both current and run off 
if lloyd s fails this test  the fsa may require lloyd s to cease trading and or its members to cease or reduce underwriting 
lloyd s as a whole is authorized by the fsa and is required to implement certain rules prescribed by the fsa  pursuant to its powers under the lloyd s act relating to the operation of the lloyd s market 
lloyd s prescribes  in respect of its managing agents and corporate members  certain minimum standards relating to their management and control  solvency and various other requirements 
the fsa directly monitors lloyd s managing agents compliance with the systems and controls prescribed by lloyd s 
if it appears to the fsa that either lloyd s is not fulfilling its delegated regulatory responsibilities or that managing agents are not complying with the applicable regulatory rules and guidance  the fsa may intervene at its discretion 
future regulatory changes or rulings by the fsa could impact rsml s business strategy or financial assumptions  possibly resulting in an adverse effect on rsml s financial condition and operating results 
change of control 
the fsa regulates the acquisition of control of any lloyd s managing agent which is authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that  together with its or his associates  directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a lloyd s managing agent or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such lloyd s managing agent or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such lloyd s managing agent or its parent 
table of contents company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of renaissancere s common shares or voting power would therefore be considered to have acquired control of rsml 
under the fsma  any person or entity proposing to acquire control over a lloyd s managing agent must give prior notification to the fsa of his or the entity s intention to do so 
the fsa would then have sixty working days to consider the application to acquire control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against rsml by the fsa 
lloyd s approval is also required before any person can acquire control using the same definition as for the fsa of a lloyd s managing agent or lloyd s corporate member 
other applicable laws 
lloyd s worldwide insurance and reinsurance business is subject to various regulations  laws  treaties and other applicable policies of the european union  as well as each nation  state and locality in which it operates 
material changes in governmental requirements and laws could have an adverse affect on lloyd s and its member companies  including rsml and renaissancere ccl 
environmental and climate change matters our principal coverages and services relate to natural disasters and catastrophes  such as earthquakes or hurricanes 
we believe  and believe the consensus view of current scientific studies substantiates  that changes in climate conditions  primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels  are likely to increase the severity  and possibly the frequency  of natural disasters and catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past years 
we expect that this may increase the risk of claims under our property and casualty lines of business  particularly with respect to properties located in coastal areas and operations covered by our crop insurance line of business  among others 
while a substantial portion of our coverages accordingly may be adversely impacted by climate change  we have taken certain measures  to the extent permissible by law and prevailing market conditions  to mitigate against such losses by giving consideration to these risks in our underwriting decisions 
we continuously monitor and adjust  as we believe appropriate  our risk management models to reflect our judgment of how to interpret current developments and information such as the studies referred to above 
however  it is possible that  even after these assessments  we will have underestimated the frequency or severity of hurricanes or other catastrophes 
to the extent broad environmental factors  exacerbated by climate change or otherwise  lead to increases in likely insured losses  particularly if those losses exceed expectations and the prior estimates of market participants  regulators or other stakeholders  the markets and clients we serve may be disrupted and adversely impacted  and we may be adversely affected  directly or indirectly 
further  certain of our investments such as catastrophe linked securities and property catastrophe managed joint ventures related to hurricane coverage  could also be adversely impacted by climate change 
an increasing number of federal  state  local and foreign government requirements and international agreements apply to environmental and climate change  in particular by seeking to limit or penalize the discharge of materials such as greenhouse gas ghg into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
although our operations are characterized by a small number of professional office facilities  and we have not been directly  materially impacted by these changes to date  it is our policy to monitor and seek to ensure compliance with these requirements  as applicable 
we believe that  as a general matter  our policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to identify and manage environmental and climate related risks  particularly the risks of potential financial liability in connection with our reinsurance  insurance and trading businesses 
however  we believe that some risk of environmental damage is inherent in respect of any commercial operation  and may increase for us if our business continues to expand and diversify  including as a result of the possible expansion of the products and services offered by real 
for example  our weather and energy risk management operations and our customers of such services could be impacted by climate change and increased ghg regulation 
likewise  certain of our investments may also be adversely affected by climate change and increased governmental regulation of  or international agreements pertaining to  ghg emissions 
moreover  our evaluation may be flawed or may reflect inaccurate or incomplete information  and it is possible our exposure to climate change or other environmental risks is greater than we have currently estimated 
at this time  we do not believe that any existing or currently pending climate change legislation  regulation  or international treaty or accord known to us would be reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or on our results of operations  capital expenditures or financial position 
however  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies  could give rise to more severe exposure  more costly compliance requirements  or otherwise bring into question our current policies and practices 
in addition  it is possible that state insurance regulation could impact the ability of our customers  or of the company  to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant 
table of contents climate driven losses 
for example  if our reinsurance segment customers or individual risk operations are unable to utilize actuarially sound  risk based pricing  to modify policy terms if necessary to reflect changes in the underlying risks  or to otherwise manage exposures appropriately to reflect the risk of increased loss from both large scale natural catastrophes and smaller scale weather events  our markets  customers  or our own financial results may all be adversely affected 
we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this form k and other documents we file with the sec include the following risks related to our company our exposure to catastrophic events and other exposures that we cover could cause our financial results to vary significantly from one period to the next 
our largest product based on total gross premiums written is property catastrophe reinsurance 
we also sell lines of specialty reinsurance and certain individual risk products that are exposed to catastrophe risk 
we therefore have a large overall exposure to natural and man made disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tsunamis  winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  tornados  hailstorms  drought and other natural or man made disasters  such as acts of terrorism 
as a result  our operating results have historically been  and we expect will continue to be  significantly affected by relatively few events of a large magnitude 
we expect claims from catastrophic events to cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year  moreover  catastrophic claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to write new business could also be affected 
we believe that increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property  particularly along coastal regions  and the effects of inflation may continue to increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future 
from time to time  we expect to have greater exposures in one or more specific geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market would unilaterally suggest 
accordingly  when and if catastrophes occur in these areas  we may experience relatively more severe net negative impacts from such events than our competitors 
in particular  the company has historically had a relatively large percentage of its coverage exposures concentrated in the state of florida 
through renaissance trading and real  we sell certain financial products primarily to address weather risks  and engage in certain weather  energy and commodity derivatives trading activities 
the trading markets for these derivatives are generally linked to energy and agriculture commodities  weather and other natural phenomena 
we expect our results from these activities will be subject to volatility  both potentially as a result of the occurrence or non occurrence of the event or events which might trigger counterparty payments under these contracts  and as a result of the potential for variance in the reportable fair value of these contracts between periods as a result of a wide number of potential factors 
while our current portfolio of such derivative contracts is not material to our consolidated results taken as a whole  and is currently of comparably short duration  it is possible that our results from these activities will increase on an absolute or relative basis over time  and that the duration of the derivative contracts in this portfolio will lengthen in the future 
we may fail to execute our strategy  which would impair our future financial results 
historically  our principal product has been property catastrophe reinsurance 
as we have expanded and continue to expand into other lines of business  we have been and will be presented with new and expanded challenges and risks which we may not manage successfully 
businesses in early stages of development present substantial business  financial and operational risks and may suffer significant losses 
for example  our current and potential future expansion may require us to develop new client and customer relationships  supplement existing or build new operating procedures  hire staff  develop and install management information and other systems  as well as take numerous other steps to implement our strategies 
if we fail to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure  or otherwise fail to execute our strategy  our results from these newer lines of business will likely suffer  perhaps substantially  and our future financial results may be adversely affected 
in addition  our expansion into newer lines of business may place increased demands on our financial  managerial and human resources 
for example  we may need to attract additional professionals  and to the extent we are unable to attract such additional professionals  our existing financial  managerial and human resources may be strained 
our future profitability depends in part on our ability to further develop our resources and effectively manage expansion  and our inability to do so may impair our future financial results 
it is also possible that a determination to retract or diminish an initiative we had previously determined to incubate or explore could be poorly executed  leading to restructuring or other losses  or to executive distraction  exceeding our estimates 
a decline in the ratings assigned to our financial strength may adversely impact our business  perhaps materially so 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of reinsurers and insurers  such as renaissance reinsurance and certain of our other operating subsidiaries and joint ventures 
these ratings are based upon 
table of contents criteria established by the rating agencies 
periodically  the rating agencies evaluate us and may downgrade or withdraw their financial strength ratings in the future if we do not continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
the financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies to reinsurance or insurance companies are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
these ratings are subject to periodic review and may be revised or revoked  by the agencies which issue them 
in addition  from time to time one or more rating agencies have effected changes in their capital models and rating methodologies  which have generally served to increase the amounts of capital required to support the ratings  and it is possible that legislation arising as a result of the ongoing financial crisis may result in additional changes 
negative ratings actions in the future could have an adverse effect on our ability to fully realize the market opportunities we currently expect to participate in 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our customers to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date  we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers  and our results of operations  could be materially adversely affected by any such ratings downgrade 
for example  following a ratings downgrade we might lose customers to more highly rated competitors or retain a lower share of the business of our customers 
for the current ratings of certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures  refer to item business  ratings 
because we depend on a few insurance and reinsurance brokers in our reinsurance segment and several third party program managers in our individual risk segment for a preponderance of our revenue  loss of business provided by them could adversely affect us 
our reinsurance business markets insurance and reinsurance products worldwide exclusively through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
three brokerage firms accounted for of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  subsidiaries and affiliates of aon benfield  marsh inc and the willis group accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our reinsurance segment gross premiums written in our individual risk business markets a significant portion of its insurance and reinsurance products through third party program managers 
in recent years  our individual risk business has similarly experienced an increased concentration of production from a smaller number of intermediaries 
third party program managers accounted for of our individual risk segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  the loss of a substantial portion of the business provided by our brokers and or third party program managers would have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to market our products could decline as a result of any loss of the business provided by these brokers and or third party program managers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease 
the terms of the federal multiple peril crop insurance program may change and adversely impact us 
we are one of companies that currently participate in the mpci program sponsored by the rma 
in recent years  crop insurance premiums  which are primarily driven by mpci  have become an increasingly larger portion of our business  totaling million of gross premiums written in  and representing of the total gross premiums written in our individual risk segment in in june  we purchased the assets of agro national  llc  a managing general underwriter that has been producing mpci business on our behalf since  for a purchase price of million  and we have goodwill and intangible assets of million on our consolidated balance sheet at december  as a result of this acquisition 
the rma has currently proposed several changes to the sra that  if ultimately adopted  would adversely affect the financial results of mpci insurers such as ours  beginning in if the sra is finalized as drafted  we would receive lower expense reimbursements and would be likely to retain less of the underwriting profit we generate  which would negatively impact the profitability of our mpci business  perhaps substantially or materially 
table of contents so 
while we might try to adjust to such changes by reducing costs  altering service levels  or taking other actions  it is possible any remedies or mitigating measures we might pursue would be insufficient or that we would not succeed in their execution  and the mpci business could prove to be unattractive or unprofitable 
if the rma adopts the currently proposed changes to the sra  this could reduce the probability that our crop insurance business is successful  or possibly result in us electing not to participate in the mpci program in  any of which in turn could require us to impair all  or a portion  of the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded in connection with the acquisition of agro national  llc 
industry feedback to the draft of the sra has to date not been positive and the rma is expected to circulate further drafts of the agreement before it becomes final 
however  we cannot predict what changes the final version will have  if any  and therefore what impact the changes will have on our future profitability  or whether we would enter into the new sra for reinsurance year our utilization of brokers  third party program managers and other third parties to support our business exposes us to operational and financial risks 
our individual risk operations rely largely on third party program managers  and other agents and brokers participating in our programs  to produce and service a substantial portion of our operations in this segment 
in these arrangements  we typically grant the program manager the right to bind us to newly issued and renewal insurance policies  subject to underwriting guidelines we provide and other contractual restrictions and obligations 
should our third party program managers issue policies that contravene these guidelines  restrictions or obligations  we could nonetheless be deemed liable for such policies 
although we would intend to resist claims that exceed or expand on our underwriting intention  it is possible that we would not prevail in such an action  or that our program manager would be unable to substantially indemnify us for their contractual breach 
we also rely on our third party program managers  third party administrators or other third parties we retain  to collect premiums and to pay valid claims 
we could also be exposed to the program manager s or their producer s operational risk  for example  but not limited to  contract wording errors  technological and staffing deficiencies and inadequate disaster recovery plans 
we could also be exposed to potential liabilities relating to the claims practices of the third party administrators we have retained to manage much of the claims activity that we expect to arise in our individual risk operations 
although we have implemented monitoring and other oversight protocols  we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate all of these exposures 
we are also subject to the risk that our successful third party program managers will not renew their programs with us 
although our contracts are generally not for defined terms  generally either party can cancel the contract in a relatively short period of time 
while we believe our arrangements offer numerous benefits to our program participants  we cannot assure you we will retain the programs that produce business we believe to be attractive or that these programs or the underlying insureds will renew with us 
failure to retain or replace the third party program managers  or the program manager s failure to retain or replace their producers  would impair our ability to execute our operational strategy  and our financial results could be adversely affected 
with respect to our reinsurance operations we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance contracts and  accordingly  like other reinsurers  are heavily dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by our ceding companies 
we are therefore subject to the risk that our customers may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured  or that the premiums ceded to us will not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume  perhaps materially so 
our claims and claim expense reserves are subject to inherent uncertainties 
our claims and claim expense reserves reflect our estimates using actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
although we use actuarial and computer models as well as historical reinsurance and insurance industry loss statistics  we also rely heavily on management s experience and judgment to assist in the establishment of appropriate claims and claim expense reserves 
however  because of the many assumptions and estimates involved in establishing reserves  the reserving process is inherently uncertain 
our estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors  and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methodologies are developed  as loss trends and claims inflation impact future payments  or as current laws or interpretations thereof change 

table of contents our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations are expected to produce claims which at times can only be resolved through lengthy and unpredictable litigation 
the measures required to resolve such claims  including the adjudication process  present more reserve challenges than property losses which tend to be reported comparatively more promptly and to be settled within a relatively shorter period of time 
actual net claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
we expect that some of our assumptions or estimates will prove to be inaccurate  and that our actual net claims and claim expenses paid will differ  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses exceed our expectations  we would be required to increase claims and claim expense reserves 
this would reduce our net income by a corresponding amount in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
to the extent that our actual claims and claim expenses are lower than our expectations  we would be required to decrease claims and claim expense reserves and this would increase our net income 
estimates of losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and our estimate of losses related to those contracts and are subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
as an example  our estimates of losses from catastrophic events  such as the hurricanes gustav and ike  and the hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s claims information from certain customers and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
due to the size and unusual complexity of the legal and claims issues relating to these events  particularly hurricanes katrina and ike  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations to us 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by customers and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
unlike the loss reserves of us insurers  the loss reserves of our bermuda licensed insurers  including renaissance reinsurance  davinci and glencoe  are not regularly examined by insurance regulators  although  as registered bermuda insurers  we are required to submit opinions of our approved loss reserve specialist with the annual statutory financial returns of our bermuda licensed insurers with regard to their respective loss and loss expenses provisions 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified actuary  must be approved by the bma 
the emergence of matters which may impact certain of our coverages  such as the asserted trend toward potentially significant global warming and the recent financial crisis  could cause us to underestimate our exposures and potentially adversely impact our financial results  perhaps significantly 
in our reinsurance business  we use analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each reinsurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of reinsurance contracts 
for catastrophe exposed business in our individual risk segment  we also seek to utilize proprietary modeling tools that have been developed in conjunction with the modeling and other resources utilized in our reinsurance operations 
see item business  underwriting and enterprise risk management 
in general  our techniques for evaluating catastrophe risk are much better developed than those for other classes of risk in businesses that we have entered into recently or may enter into in the future 
our models and databases may not accurately address the emergence of a variety of matters which might be deemed to impact certain of our coverages 
accordingly  our models may understate the exposures we are assuming and our financial results may be adversely impacted  perhaps significantly 
we believe  and believe the consensus view of current scientific studies substantiates  that changes in climate conditions  primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels  are likely to increase the severity and possibly the frequency of natural catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past years 
we expect that this may increase claims under our property and casualty lines of business  particularly with respect to properties located in coastal areas and operations covered by our multi peril crop insurance line of business  among 
table of contents others 
while a substantial portion of our insureds fall into categories that may be adversely impacted by climate change  we have taken certain measures  to the extent permissible by law and prevailing market conditions  to mitigate against such losses by giving consideration to these risks in our underwriting decisions 
we continuously monitor and adjust  as we believe appropriate  our risk management models to reflect our judgment of how to interpret current developments and information such as these studies 
however  it is possible that  even after these assessments  we will have underestimated the frequency or severity of hurricanes or other catastrophes 
to the extent broad environmental factors  exacerbated by climate change or otherwise  lead to increases in likely insured losses  particularly if those losses exceed expectations and the prior estimates of market participants  regulators or other stakeholders  the markets and clients we serve may be disrupted and adversely impacted  and we may be adversely affected  directly or indirectly 
further  certain of our investments such as cat linked securities and property catastrophe managed joint ventures related to hurricane coverage  could also be adversely impacted by climate change 
changing weather patterns and climatic conditions  such as global warming  may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in some parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures 
our specialty reinsurance portfolio is also exposed to emerging risks arising from the ongoing financial crisis  including with respect to a potential increase of claims in directors officers  errors omissions  mortgage valuation  surety  casualty clash and other lines of business 
the ongoing weakness in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could adversely affect our business and operating results 
although there have been some indicators of stabilization  the us and numerous other leading markets around the world continue to experience significant recessionary conditions  and we believe meaningful risk remains of potential further deterioration in economic conditions  including substantial and continuing financial market disruptions 
while many governments  including the us federal government  have taken substantial steps to stabilize economic conditions in an effort to increase liquidity and capital availability  if economic conditions do not stabilize  or deteriorate further  the business environment in our principal markets would be further adversely affected  which accordingly could adversely affect demand for the products sold by us or our customers 
in addition  during an economic downturn we believe our consolidated credit risk  reflecting our counterparty dealings with agents  brokers  customers  retrocessionaires  capital providers  parties associated with our investment portfolio  among others  is likely to be increased 
moreover  we continue to monitor the risk that our principal markets will experience increased inflationary conditions  which would  among other things  cause loss costs to increase  and impact the performance of our investment portfolio 
the onset  duration and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision 
some of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that may experience significant market valuation fluctuations 
although we invest primarily in highly liquid securities in order to ensure our ability to pay valid claims in a prompt manner  we do hold certain investments that may lack liquidity  such as our alternative investments and bank loan fund investments 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
at times  the reported value of our liquid and relatively illiquid types of investments and  our high quality  generally liquid asset classes  do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset 
if we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 
a reduction in market liquidity may make it difficult to value certain of our securities as trading becomes less frequent 
as such  valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents the determination of the impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the determination of the impairments taken on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future  which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
a decline in our investment performance could reduce our profitability and hinder our ability to pay claims promptly in accordance with our strategy 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our income from our invested assets  which are comprised of  among other things  fixed maturity securities  such as bonds  asset backed securities  mortgage backed securities and investments in bank loan funds  hedge funds and private equity partnerships 
accordingly  our financial results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency risk  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
additionally  with respect to certain of our investments  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk 
our invested assets have grown over the years and have come to effect a comparably greater contribution to our financial results 
accordingly  a failure to successfully execute our investment strategy could have a material adverse effect on our overall results 
in the event of a significant or total loss in our investment portfolio  the company s ability to pay any claims promptly in accordance with our strategy could be adversely affected 
the market value of our fixed maturity investments is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates and widening credit spreads 
increases in interest rates could cause the market value of our investment portfolio to decrease  perhaps substantially 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could reduce our investment yield  which would reduce our overall profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity 
a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other investments which we expect to have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
these other investments include private equity partnerships  hedge fund investments  senior secured bank loan funds and catastrophe bonds and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of certain of these investments is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments 
these net asset valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of the investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes of the investments 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
in addition  we typically do not hold the underlying securities of these investments in our custody accounts  as a result  we generally do not have the ability to quantify the risks associated with these investments in the same manner for which we have for our fixed maturity securities 
the performance of these investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and the investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective or that such managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk  including with respect to reinsurance brokers 
in accordance with industry practice  we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts over to the insurers that have reinsured a 
table of contents portion of their liabilities with us we refer to these insurers as ceding insurers 
likewise  premiums due to us by ceding insurers are virtually all paid to brokers  who then pass such amounts on to us 
in many jurisdictions  if a broker were to fail to make such a payment to a ceding insurer  we would remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  in many jurisdictions  when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid by the cedants and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  in connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances  we assume a substantial degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world 
we are also exposed to the credit risk of our customers  who  pursuant to their contracts with us  frequently pay us over time 
our premiums receivable at december  totaled million  and these amounts are generally not collateralized 
to the extent such customers become unable to pay future premiums  we would be required to recognize a downward adjustment to our premiums receivable in our financial statements 
in  we increased our allowance for potentially uncollectible premiums due to us  and we cannot assure you that such premiums will ever be collected or that additional amounts will not be required to be written down in  or future periods 
as a result of the ongoing global economic downturn  our consolidated credit risk  reflecting our counterparty dealings with agents  brokers  customers  retrocessionaires  capital providers  parties associated with our investment portfolio and others has increased  perhaps materially so 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risks in connection with our energy related trading business 
we undertake energy related trading activities through our operating subsidiaries  including renaissance trading and real  where counterparty credit risk becomes a relevant factor 
these operating subsidiaries execute weather  energy and commodity derivative transactions where the value of the derivatives at any point in time is dependent upon not only the market but also the viability of the counterparty 
the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss in these situations 
financial institutions  energy companies and hedge funds have historically been our most significant counterparties 
the ongoing instability of the financial markets has resulted in many financial institutions becoming significantly less creditworthy  and we are exposed to these counterparty risks 
although our operating subsidiaries have credit risk management policies and procedures  we cannot assure you that any of the policies or procedures will be effective 
while many of the original trading positions established in our energy related trading business are partially or substantially hedged  the effectiveness of those hedges depends on the willingness and ability to pay of the parties with whom we establish the hedge positions 
the failure of our policies and procedures  or the failure of one or more of our counterparties  could result in losses that substantially exceed our expectations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms 
as part of our risk management  we buy reinsurance for our own account 
this type of insurance when purchased to protect reinsurance companies is known as retrocessional reinsurance 
our primary insurance companies also buy reinsurance from third parties 
from time to time  market conditions including the ongoing financial crisis have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining reinsurance 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms as favorable to us as in the past 
this could limit the amount of business we are willing to write  or decrease the protection available to us as a result of large loss events 
when we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance for our own account  the insolvency  inability or reluctance of any of our reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 
generally  we believe that the willingness to pay of some reinsurers and retrocessionaires is declining  and that the overall industry ability to pay has also declined due to the recent financial crisis and other factors 
this risk may be more significant to us at present than at most times in the past 
at december   we had recorded million of reinsurance recoverables  net of a valuation allowance of million for uncollectible recoverables 
we cannot assure you that such recoverables will ever be collected or that additional amounts will not be required to be written down in  or future periods 
a large portion of our reinsurance recoverables are concentrated with a relatively small number of reinsurers 
the risk of such concentration of retrocessional coverage may be increased by recent and future consolidation within the industry 

table of contents emerging claim and coverage issues  or other litigation  could adversely affect us 
unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance and reinsurance contracts 
these developments and changes may adversely affect us  perhaps materially so 
for example  we could be subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent  or to increases in the number or size of claims to which we are subject 
with respect to our specialty reinsurance and individual risk operations  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some point in time after their occurrence 
for example  we could be deemed liable for losses arising out of a matter  such as the potential for industry losses arising out of an avian flu pandemic  that we had not anticipated or had attempted to contractually exclude 
moreover  irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or not issue a ruling adverse to us 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute insurance and reinsurance contract and policy wordings 
alternatively  potential efforts by us to exclude such exposures could  if successful  reduce the market s acceptance of our related products 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
our exposure to this uncertainty will grow as our long tail casualty businesses grow  because in these lines claims can typically be made for many years  making them more susceptible to these trends than our traditional catastrophe business  which is typically more short tail 
in addition  we could be adversely affected by the growing trend of plaintiffs targeting participants in the property liability insurance industry in purported class action litigation relating to claim handling and other practices 
while we continually seek to improve the effectiveness of our contracts and claims capabilities  we may fail to mitigate our exposure to these growing uncertainties 
the loss of key senior members of management could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend  in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers 
the loss of services of members of senior management in the future  and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team  may strain our ability to execute our growth initiatives 
the loss of one or more of our senior officers could adversely impact our business  by  for example  making it more difficult to retain customers or other business contacts whose relationship depends in part on the service of the departing officer 
in general  the loss of the services of any members of our current senior management team  potentially including the executive retirements announced in january  may adversely affect our business  perhaps materially so 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
in addition  our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and service personnel 
the location of our global headquarters in bermuda may impede our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians  holders of permanent residents certificates and holders of working residents certificates may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a valid government work permit 
substantially all of our officers are working in bermuda under work permits that will expire over the next three years 
the bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits  which would adversely impact us 
in addition  a bermuda government policy limits the duration of work permits to a total of six years  which is subject to certain exemptions only for key employees 
a work permit is issued with an expiry date up to five years and no assurances can be given that any work permit will be issued or  if issued  renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term 
if any of our senior officers were not permitted to remain in bermuda  or if we experience delays or failures to obtain permits for a number of our professional staff  our operations could be disrupted and our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result 
us taxing authorities could contend that one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries are subject to us corporate income tax  as a result of changes in law or regulations  or otherwise 
if the irs were to contend successfully that one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries is engaged in a trade or business in the us  such subsidiary would  to the extent not exempted from tax by the us bermuda income tax treaty  be subject to us corporate income tax on that portion of its net income treated as effectively connected with a us trade or business  as well as the us corporate branch profits tax 
although we would vigorously resist such a contention  if we were ultimately held to be subject to taxation  our earnings would correspondingly decline 

table of contents in addition  benefits of the us bermuda income tax treaty which may limit any such tax to income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by one or more of our bermuda subsidiaries in the us are only available to any of such subsidiaries if more than of its shares are beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by individuals who are bermuda residents or us citizens or residents 
our bermuda subsidiaries may not be able to continually satisfy such beneficial ownership test or be able to establish it to the satisfaction of the irs 
finally  it is unclear whether the us bermuda income tax treaty assuming satisfaction of the beneficial ownership test applies to income other than premium income  such as investment income 
changes in us tax law or regulations could increase the costs of our products and services or otherwise reduce our profitability 
congress has recently conducted hearings relating to the tax treatment of offshore insurance and is reported to be considering legislation that would adversely affect reinsurance between affiliates and offshore insurance and reinsurance more generally 
in  us rep 
richard neal introduced one such proposal  hr the neal bill  which provides that foreign insurers and reinsurers would be capped in deducting reinsurance premiums ceded from us units to offshore affiliates 
the neal bill  which was referred to the house ways and means committee  would limit deductions for related party reinsurance cessions to the average percentage of premium ceded to unrelated reinsurers determined in reference to individual business lines 
in the first quarter of  the current administration released its initial budget  which included a proposal to raise revenue by enacting increased taxation on international reinsurance via means which appeared to have similarities with the neal bill 
we can provide no assurance that this legislation or similar legislation will not be adopted 
we believe that passage of such legislation would adversely affect us  perhaps materially 
in addition  in march  us senator carl levin and rep 
lloyd doggett introduced legislation in the us senate and house  respectively  entitled the stop tax haven abuse act s 

if enacted  this legislation would  among other things  cause to be treated as a us corporation for us tax purposes generally  entities whose shares are publicly traded on an established securities market  or whose gross assets are million or more  if the management and control of such a corporation is  directly or indirectly  treated as occurring primarily within the us the proposed legislation provides that a corporation will be so treated if substantially all of the executive officers and senior management of the corporation who exercise day to day responsibility for making decisions involving strategic  financial  and operational policies of the corporation are located primarily within the us in addition  among other things  the legislation would establish presumptions for entities and transactions in jurisdictions deemed to be offshore secrecy jurisdictions and would provide a list of such jurisdictions 
to date  this legislation has not been approved by either the house of representatives or the senate 
however  we can provide no assurance that this legislation or similar legislation will not ultimately be adopted 
while we do not believe that the legislation would impact us  it is possible that an adopted bill would include additional or expanded provisions which could negatively impact us  or that the interpretation or enforcement of the current proposal  if enacted  would be more expansive or adverse than we currently estimate

 in which it publicly adopted the position that the federal excise tax imposed on insurance or reinsurance premiums paid to certain non us taxpayers the fet applies to reinsurance contracts between foreign insurance companies 
simultaneously  the irs issued announcement  announcing a voluntary compliance initiative under which eligible non us insurers  reinsurers  and other agents  solicitors  and brokers may avoid irs examination with respect to the fet 
under section of the internal revenue code  premiums on insurance policies  indemnity bonds  annuity contracts  and reinsurance contracts with respect to risks located in the us paid by a us person or by a non us person engaged in a trade or business in the us are subject to the fet 
the fet is imposed at the rate of on casualty insurance and indemnity bonds  on life  health  and annuity contracts  and on reinsurance 
the irs has authority to collect the tax not only from the person paying the premium but also from any person who signs  sells or issues documents connected with the policy 
in the pronouncements noted above  the irs took the position that the fet cascades through reinsurance contracts on us risks between foreign insurers 
while commentators and market participants have questioned the statutory and jurisdictional basis for the irs s position  the irs has continued to assert that  under this cascading theory  if a foreign insurance company insures or reinsures a us risk that would be subject to the fet  and then obtains reinsurance for that risk from a second foreign insurance company  the fet applies to the reinsurance contract between the two foreign parties unless a treaty exemption applies 
further  the irs has asserted that fet applies even where the first foreign insurance company is exempt from fet under an applicable treaty 
we did not elect to participate in the voluntary compliance initiative  and it is possible that the irs would disagree with 
table of contents our position with respect to fet and the irs s cascade theory 
in  we were contacted by the irs and asked to provide information with respect to the fet filings effected by renaissance reinsurance in while we believe our fet position is supported by a thorough analysis of relevant statutory and case law  and believe that the imposition of the irs position would not give rise to material financial obligations  it is possible the irs will continue to maintain its position and could prevail in any audit or other controversy or that the financial consequences of the irs s position would be greater than we currently estimate 
we are unable to predict the effect that current governmental proposals could have on the company 
the current administration and congress have made  or called for consideration of  several additional proposals relating to a variety of issues  including with respect to universal healthcare  financial regulation reform  including regulation of the otc derivatives market  the establishment of a single state system of licensure for us and foreign reinsurers  executive compensation and others 
we continue to carefully monitor relevant proposals and believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material 
at this time  we are unable to predict with certainty which  if any  proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on us 
regulatory challenges in the us or elsewhere to our bermuda operations claims of exemption from insurance regulation could restrict our ability to operate  increase our costs  or otherwise adversely impact us 
renaissance reinsurance  davinci and top layer re are not licensed or admitted in any jurisdiction except bermuda 
renaissance reinsurance  glencoe  davinci and top layer re each conduct business only from their principal offices in bermuda and do not maintain an office in the us the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us and various states within the us if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
moreover  we could be put at a competitive disadvantage in the future with respect to competitors that are licensed and admitted in us jurisdictions 
among other things  jurisdictions in the us do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted 
our contracts generally require us to post a letter of credit or provide other security after a reinsured reports a claim 
in order to post these letters of credit  issuing banks generally require collateral 
it is possible that the european union or other countries might adopt a similar regime in the future  or that us rules could be altered in a way that treats bermuda based companies disproportionately 
any such development  or if we are unable to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required  could significantly and negatively affect our operations 
glencoe and lantana are currently each eligible  non admitted excess and surplus lines insurers in us states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  and are each subject to certain regulatory and reporting requirements of these jurisdictions 
however  neither glencoe nor lantana is admitted or licensed in any us jurisdiction  moreover  glencoe only conducts business from bermuda 
accordingly  the scope of glencoe s and lantana s activities in the us is limited  which could adversely affect their ability to compete 
although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal and or state measures may be introduced and promulgated that could result in increased oversight and regulation of surplus lines insurance 
additionally  some recent and pending cases in florida and california courts have raised potentially significant questions regarding surplus lines insurance in those states such as whether surplus lines insurers will be subject to policy form content  filing and approval requirements or additional taxes 
in  the florida supreme court held that surplus lines insurers were subject to insurance law provisions governing policy delivery  policy forms  the payment of attorney fees and other matters  however  in  the florida legislature passed fl sb and hb to clarify the limited applicability of florida insurance law to surplus lines insurers exempt from the provisions governing policy delivery  policy forms  etc this case could foreshadow more extensive oversight of surplus lines insurance by other jurisdictions  which could adversely impact our excess and surplus lines business  or the surplus lines markets for which we are a lead reinsurer 
stonington  which writes insurance in all states and the district of columbia on an admitted basis  is subject to extensive regulation under state statutes which confer regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers on state insurance commissioners 
such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors or shareholders of the insurer 

table of contents our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our currently unregulated non insurance subsidiaries to become subject to some form of regulation 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
we could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with any new or additional regulatory requirements  and any such requirements may impact the operations of our insurance and or non insurance subsidiaries and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
in addition  we could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
we are unable to predict the effect that governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will have on such markets generally or on the company in particular 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   then president bush signed the emergency economic stabilization act eesa into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
subsequently  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra  a billion stimulus bill for the purpose of stabilizing the economy by  among other things  creating jobs 
the us federal government and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
some companies that engage in both life and property casualty insurance lines of business  have participated in the arra programs and many believe that current market conditions have been adversely impacted by the government support of certain large market participants  which may have contributed to inadequate pricing conditions in respect of certain lines and coverages 
we are unable to predict the effect that any such governmental actions will have on the financial markets generally or on the company s competitive position  business and financial condition in particular  though we are monitoring the situation as it evolves 
operational risks  including systems or human failures  are inherent in business  including ours 
we are subject to operational risks including fraud  employee errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements  information technology failures  or external events 
losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant 
as our business and operations grow more complex we are exposed to more risk in these areas 
our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our success 
moreover  our proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
while we have implemented disaster recovery and other business contingency plans  a defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our reputation 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls  information technology and application systems  but internal controls provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are exposed to risks in connection with our management of third party capital 
certain of our operating subsidiaries manage third party capital  and in some cases our own capital 
we manage our own capital and other capital through our lloyd s managing agency business 
depending on the jurisdiction and form of organization  our operating subsidiaries may owe certain legal duties and obligations to third party investors including reporting obligations and are subject to a variety of often complex laws and regulations 
compliance with some of these laws and regulations requires significant management time and attention  particularly with respect to our newer businesses and ventures 
although we seek to continually monitor our policies and procedures to attempt to ensure compliance  faulty judgments  simple errors or mistakes  or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established policies and procedures  could result in our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations which could result in significant liabilities  penalties or other losses to the company  and seriously harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar  however  as we expand geographically  an increasing portion of our premium is  and likely will be  written in currencies other than the us dollar and a portion of our claims and claim expense reserves is also in non us dollar currencies 
moreover  we maintain a portion of our cash and investments in currencies other than the us dollar 
although we generally seek to hedge significant non us dollar positions  we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting solely from fluctuations in the values of these foreign currencies  which could cause our consolidated earnings to decrease 
in addition  failure to manage our foreign currency exposures could cause our results of operations to be more volatile 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis 
the capital requirements of our business depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to sell our reinsurance and insurance products is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to support our future operating requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
while we do not currently expect to require additional external capital in the near term due to our strong current capital position  our operations are subject to the ever present potential for significant volatility in capital due to our exposure to potentially significant catastrophic events 
any further equity or debt financing  or capacity needed for letters of credit  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us  particularly in light of the recent disruptions  uncertainty and volatility in the capital and credit markets 
our ability to raise such capital successfully would depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time  including our financial position and operating results  market conditions  and applicable legal issues 
access to capital on attractive terms has been challenging for many companies during the ongoing global credit crisis 
if we are unable to obtain adequate capital if and when needed  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
in addition  in the future we may be unable to raise new capital for our managed joint ventures and other private alternative investment vehicles  which would reduce our future fee income and market capacity 
our principal existing letter of credit facility and our revolving credit facility are scheduled to expire on april  and march   respectively 
for more information  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources 
we may not succeed in renewing or replacing these facilities on terms attractive to us or at all 
our ability to renew or replace these credit facilities is subject to many factors beyond our control  such as more stringent credit criteria and or conditions emanating from or as a result of the recent difficult conditions in the global capital and credit markets  the effect of which may be to make a renewal or replacement so onerous as to make us consider alternate sources of such liquidity or limit our ability to write business for our customers 
the covenants in our debt agreements limit our financial and operational flexibility  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have incurred indebtedness  and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
at december   we had an aggregate of million of indebtedness outstanding 
our indebtedness primarily consists of publicly traded notes and letter of credit and revolving credit facilities 
for more details on our indebtedness  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources 
the agreements covering our indebtedness  particularly our bank loans  contain covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
these agreements also require us to maintain specific financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders under our credit facilities could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them  cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters of credit  or both  and require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral 
because we are a holding company  we are dependent on dividends and payments from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no direct operations  we rely on investment income  cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the holding company does not have any operations and from time to time may not have significant liquid assets 
bermuda law and various us insurance regulations may limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends 
if our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us  we may be unable to pay dividends or to repay our indebtedness 
for example  since our us insurance subsidiaries may only pay dividends out of earned surplus  and as these subsidiaries earned surplus is negative  they cannot currently pay dividends without the applicable state insurance department approval 

table of contents acquisitions or strategic investments that we have made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we frequently monitor and analyze opportunities to acquire or make a strategic investment in new or other businesses that will not detract from our core reinsurance and individual risk operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
any failure by us to effectively limit such risks or implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
results in certain of our newer or potentially expanding business lines could cause significant volatility in our consolidated financial statements 
as we continue to grow and diversify our operations  certain of our new or potentially expanding business lines could have a significant negative impact on our financial results or cause significant volatility in our results for any fiscal quarter or year 
for example  we may experience losses or experience significant volatility in our financial results with respect to our crop insurance business as a result of volatility in commodity prices and weather events  such as flooding  drought  hail  windstorms and other natural phenomena  all of which impacts the profitability of this line of business 
in addition  our weather and energy products and trading business is accounted for at fair value and the value of our positions can change significantly which could have a significant negative impact on our financial results  or cause significant volatility in our results for any fiscal quarter or year 
some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
some provisions of our amended and restated bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute or more of any class or series of our shares 
in addition  our byelaws reduce the total voting power of any shareholder owning  directly or indirectly  beneficially or otherwise  as described in our bye laws  more than of our common shares to not more than of the total voting power of our capital stock unless otherwise waived at the discretion of the board 
the primary purpose of these provisions is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of the internal revenue code for us federal tax purposes 
however  these provisions may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of common shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for  among other things a classified board  whose size is fixed and whose members may be removed by the shareholders only for cause upon a vote  restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors  submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and requisition special general meetings  a large number of authorized but unissued shares which may be issued by the board without further shareholder action  and a shareholder vote to amend  repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with several provisions of the bye laws 
these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions are designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions could have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these bye law provisions could prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares 

table of contents we indirectly own certain us based insurance subsidiaries 
our ownership of a us insurance company can  under applicable state insurance company laws and regulations  delay or impede a change of control of renaissancere 
it is possible that we will form  acquire or invest in other us domestic insurance companies in the future  which could make this risk more severe 
under applicable state insurance regulations  any proposed purchase of or more of our voting securities would require the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulatory authorities 
in addition  similar provisions apply to our lloyd s managing agent  whereby the fsa regulates the acquisition of control of any lloyd s managing agent which is authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that  together with its or his associates  directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a lloyd s managing agent or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such lloyd s managing agent or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such lloyd s managing agent or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
investors may have difficulties in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the us we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the us all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the us investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the us on our directors and officers who reside outside the us or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the us to receive service of process 
risks related to our industry the reinsurance and insurance businesses are historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our products may decline  which could affect our profitability 
the reinsurance and insurance industries have historically been cyclical  characterized by periods of decreasing prices followed by periods of increasing prices 
reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in their results of operations due to numerous factors  including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events  perceptions of risk  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and underwriting results of other insurers and reinsurers 
all of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance and insurance industries 
for example  an increase in capital in our industry after the catastrophe events  and the enactment of the florida legislation described below  helped create a softening market where pricing decreased in certain lines and became less attractive  on the other hand  the combination of the storms and the effects of the recent financial crisis resulted in relatively attractive market conditions at the time of the july  and january  catastrophe renewals 
the catastrophe exposed lines in which we are a market leader are affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters 
the occurrence  or nonoccurrence  of catastrophic events  the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable  affects both industry results and consequently prevailing market prices of our products 
we expect premium rates and other terms and conditions of trade to vary in the future 
if demand for our products falls or the supply of competing capacity rises  our prospects for potential growth  due in part to our disciplined approach to underwriting  may be adversely affected 
in particular  we might lose existing customers or decline business  which we might not regain when industry conditions improve 
in recent years  hedge funds and investment banks have been increasingly active in the reinsurance market and markets for related risks 
while this trend has slowed during the ongoing period of financial dislocation  we generally expect increased competition from a wider range of entrants over time 
it is possible that such new or alternative capital could cause reductions in prices of our products 
to the extent that industry pricing of our products does not meet our hurdle rate  we would generally expect to reduce our future underwriting activities thus resulting in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected earnings 
recent or future legislation may decrease the demand for our property catastrophe reinsurance products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in  the state of florida enacted legislation to expand the fhcf s provision of below market rate reinsurance to up to billion per season the florida bill 
in may of  the florida legislature enacted 
table of contents bill no 
cs cs cs hb the bill  which will gradually phase out billion in optional reinsurance coverage under the fhcf over the next five years  reducing the coverage amount to billion 
the bill will also increase the cost of the optional coverage  starting with an increase by a factor of two in the season and raising costs by a factor of one in each succeeding year until the phase out is complete 
the bill similarly allows the state sponsored property insurer  citizens  to raise its rates up to starting in and every year thereafter  until such time that it has sufficient funds to pay its claims and expenses 
the rate increases and cut back on coverage by fhcf and citizens will allow for an increased role of the private insurers in florida  a market in which we have established substantial market share 
this legislation may  however  take several years to have a significant effect on the private market 
moreover  it is possible that the florida legislature will reverse or weaken the bill  for example by acting on current proposals to increase the fhcf coverage in rather than permit this coverage to recede as contemplated by the bill 
we believe the florida bill caused a substantial decline in the private reinsurance and insurance markets in and relating to florida  and contributed to the decline in our property catastrophe gross premiums written in and as compared to the florida bill and other regulatory actions over this period may have contributed to instability in the florida primary insurance market  where many insurers reported substantial and continuing losses in  an unusually low catastrophe year 
because of our position as one of the largest providers of catastrophe exposed coverage  both on a global basis and in respect of the florida market  the florida bill and the weakened financial position of florida insurers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on us compared to other reinsurance market participants 
it is also possible that other states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation based on the florida precedent  or may otherwise enact legislation  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
alternatively  legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or at the federal level 
for example  in the past  federal bills have been proposed in congress and  in  passed by the house of representatives which would  if enacted  create a federal reinsurance backstop or guarantee mechanism for catastrophic risks  including those we currently insure and reinsure in the private markets 
in  the coga was introduced in the senate to federally guarantee bond issuances by certain government entities  potentially including the fhcf  the texas windstorm insurance association  the california earthquake authority  and others 
similar legislation has been introduced in the house of representatives 
if enacted  this legislation or legislation similar to these proposals in import would  we believe  likely contribute to growth of these state entities or to their inception or alteration in a manner adverse to us 
while none of this legislation has been enacted to date  and although we believe such legislation would be vigorously opposed if introduced in  if enacted these bills would likely further erode the role of private market catastrophe reinsurers and could adversely impact our financial results  perhaps materially 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of the fhcf  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the florida market  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 
other political  regulatory and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to heavy scrutiny by the us and individual state governments as well as an increasing number of international authorities 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders 
governmental authorities in both the us and worldwide seem increasingly interested in the potential risks posed by the reinsurance industry as a whole  and to commercial and financial systems in general 
while we do not believe these inquiries have identified meaningful new risks posed by the reinsurance industry  and we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future 
for example  the us federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that will alter and likely increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
moreover  the naic  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all states and the district of columbia and state insurance regulators  regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations 
for example  we could be adversely affected by proposals to provide insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target  such as the legislation enacted in florida in or the proposed federal legislation described above  
table of contents require our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations  expand the scope of coverage under existing policies for matters such as hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  and the new orleans flood  or such as a pandemic flu outbreak  increasingly mandate the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies  establish a new federal insurance regulator or financial industry systemic risk regulator  revise laws  regulations  or contracts under which we operate  such as  but not limited to  the farm bill or the sra  disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of another  or repeal or diminish the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act 
our primary insurance business  which is regulated more comprehensively than reinsurance  increases our exposure to adverse political  judicial and legal developments 
we are incorporated in bermuda and are therefore subject to changes in bermuda law and regulation that may have an adverse impact on our operations  including imposition of tax liability or increased regulatory supervision or change in regulation 
in addition  we are subject to changes in the political environment in bermuda  which could make it difficult to operate in  or attract talent to  bermuda 
the bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including in the us and in various states within the us we are unable to predict the future impact on our operations of changes in the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject 
moreover  our exposure to potential regulatory initiatives could be heightened by the fact that our principal operating companies are domiciled in  and operate exclusively from  bermuda 
for example  bermuda  a small jurisdiction  may be disadvantaged in participating in global or cross border regulatory matters as compared with larger jurisdictions such as the us or the leading european union countries 
in addition  bermuda  which is currently an overseas territory of the uk  may consider changes to its relationship with the uk in the future 
these changes could adversely affect bermuda s position in respect of its regulatory initiatives  which could adversely impact us commercially 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major us and us insurers and property catastrophe reinsurers  including other bermuda based reinsurers 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
historically  periods of increased capacity levels in our industry generally have led to increased competition  and decreased prices for our products 
we believe that our principal competitors in the property catastrophe reinsurance market include other companies active in the bermuda market  including ace  allied world  arch  axis  endurance  everest re  ipc  montpelier re  partner re  platinum  transatlantic  validus  white mountains and xl  as well as a growing number of private  unrated reinsurers offering predominately collateralized reinsurance 
we also compete with certain lloyd s syndicates active in the london market  as well as with a number of other industry participants  such as aig  berkshire  hannover re  munich re group and swiss re 
as our business evolves over time  we expect our competitors to change as well 
for example  following hurricane katrina in august  a significant number of new reinsurance companies were formed in bermuda which have resulted in new competition  which may well continue in subsequent periods 
also  hedge funds and investment banks have shown an interest in entering the reinsurance market  either through the formation of reinsurance companies  or through the use of other financial products  such as catastrophe bonds and other cat linked securities 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the reinsurance market or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
we cannot predict what effect any of these developments may have on our businesses 
the markets in which our individual risk unit operates are also highly competitive 
primary insurers compete on the basis of factors including distribution channels  product  price  service and financial strength 
many of our primary insurance competitors  especially in jurisdictions in which we have recently expanded  or may expand in 
table of contents the future  are larger and more established than we are and have greater financial resources and consumer recognition 
we seek primary insurance pricing that will result in adequate returns on the capital allocated to our primary insurance business 
we may lose primary insurance business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices or on more advantageous terms 
consolidation in the re insurance industry could adversely impact us 
we believe that several re insurance industry participants are seeking to consolidate 
these consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if competitive pressures reduce our prices  we would expect to write less business 
as the insurance industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring and properly servicing each customer will become greater 
we could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  further reducing our operating margins 
in addition  insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated  larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance 
the number of companies offering retrocessional reinsurance may decline 
reinsurance intermediaries could also consolidate  potentially adversely impacting our ability to access business and distribute our products 
we could also experience more robust competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business or our results of operation 
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income 
the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of jurisdictions perceived by the oecd to be tax havens or to offer preferential tax regimes 
in the oecd s report dated april  and updated as of june and november via a global forum  bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
regulatory regimes and changes to accounting rules may adversely impact financial results irrespective of business operations 
accounting standards and regulatory changes may require modifications to our accounting principles  both prospectively and for prior periods and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
in particular  the sec has formally proposed a plan to first allow and then require companies to file financial statements in accordance with ifrs rather than gaap 
such changes  if ultimately adopted  could have a significant impact on our financial reporting  impacting key matters such as our loss reserving policies and premium and expense recognition 
for example  the international accounting standards board is considering adopting an accounting standard that would require all reinsurance and insurance contracts to be accounted for under a new measurement basis  contract fulfillment value  which is considered to be more closely related to fair value than the current measurement basis  and would also require that deferred acquisition costs be derecognized and that future acquisition costs be expensed as incurred 
we are currently evaluating how the sec s initiatives will impact us  including with respect to our loss reserving policy and the effect it might have on recognizing premium revenue and policy acquisition costs 
required modification of our existing principles  either with respect to these issues or other issues in the future  could have an impact on our results of operations  including changing the timing of the recognition of underwriting income  increasing the volatility of our reported earnings and changing our overall financial statement presentation 
heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry may adversely affect our business 
we believe that certain government authorities  including state officials in florida  are continuing to scrutinize and investigate a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
while we have not been named in any actions or proceedings  it is possible such scrutiny could expand to include us in the future  and it is also possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments will mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 

table of contents we cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations  and any changes in industry practice  including future legislation or regulations that may become applicable to us  will have on the insurance industry  the regulatory framework  or our business 
as noted above  because we frequently assume the credit risk of the counterparties with whom we do business throughout our insurance and reinsurance operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected if the credit quality of these counterparties is severely impacted by the current investigations in the insurance industry or by changes to industry practices

this category of business litigation may involve allegations of underwriting or claims handling errors or misconduct  employment claims  regulatory activity or disputes arising from our business ventures 
any such litigation or arbitration contains an element of uncertainty  and we believe the inherent uncertainty in such matters may have increased recently and will likely continue to increase

overview renaissancere  established in bermuda in to write principally property catastrophe reinsurance  is today a leading global provider of reinsurance and insurance coverages and related services 
through our operating subsidiaries  we seek to produce superior returns for our shareholders by being a trusted  long term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk  delivering responsive solutions  and keeping our promises 
we accomplish this by leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management  and by investing in our capabilities to serve our customers across the cycles that have historically characterized our markets 
overall  our strategy focuses on superior risk selection  marketing  capital management and joint ventures 
we provide value to our customers and joint venture partners in the form of financial security  innovative products  and responsive service 
we are known as a leader in paying valid reinsurance claims promptly 
we principally measure our financial success through long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends  which we believe is the most appropriate measure of our company s performance  and believe we have delivered superior performance in respect of this measure over time 
since a substantial portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes  our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events  and the coverages we offer to customers affected by these events 
we are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures that we cover 
accordingly  we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year  based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world 
our revenues are principally derived from three sources net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell  net investment income and realized and unrealized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell  and other income received from our joint ventures  advisory services  weather and energy risk management operations and various other items 
our expenses primarily consist of net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell  acquisition costs which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write  operating expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses  rent and other operating expenses  corporate expenses which include certain executive  legal and consulting expenses  costs for research and development  and other miscellaneous costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire  which represents the interest of third parties with respect to the net income loss of davincire  and interest and dividend costs related to our debt and preference shares 
we are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal 
we currently expect our growth outside of bermuda to result in a higher effective tax rate in future periods 
the operating results  also known as the underwriting results  of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio  underwriting expense ratio  and combined ratio 
the net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses acquisition expenses and operational expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio below generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
a combined ratio over generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income 
we also 
table of contents discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on an accident year basis 
this ratio is calculated by taking net claims and claim expenses  excluding development on net claims and claim expenses from events that took place in prior fiscal years  divided by net premiums earned 
we currently conduct our business through two reportable segments  reinsurance and individual risk 
those segments are more fully described as follows reinsurance our reinsurance segment has three main units property catastrophe reinsurance  written for our own account and for davinci  is our traditional core business 
we believe we are one of the world s leading providers of this coverage  based on catastrophe gross premiums written 
this coverage protects against large natural catastrophes  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and tsunamis  as well as claims arising from other natural and man made catastrophes such as winter storms  freezes  floods  fires  wind storms  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism 
we offer this coverage to insurance companies and other reinsurers primarily on an excess of loss basis 
this means that we begin paying when our customers claims from a catastrophe exceed a certain retained amount 
specialty reinsurance  written for our own account and for davinci  covering certain targeted classes of business where we believe we have a sound basis for underwriting and pricing the risk that we assume 
our portfolio includes various classes of business  such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  political risk  trade credit  medical malpractice  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  certain other casualty lines and other specialty lines of reinsurance that we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we believe that we are seen as a market leader in certain of these classes of business  such as casualty clash  surety  catastrophe exposed workers compensation and terrorism 
through our ventures unit  we pursue joint ventures and other strategic relationships 
our four principal business activities in this area are property catastrophe joint ventures which we manage  such as top layer re and davinci  strategic investments in other market participants  such as our investments in platinum  essent and the tower hill companies  where  rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves  we partner with other market participants  weather and energy risk management operations primarily through renaissance trading and real  and fee based consulting services  research and development and loss and mitigation activities 
only business activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results  such as davinci  tim re ii and certain reinsurance transactions  are included in our reinsurance segment results  our share of the results of our investments in other ventures  accounted for under the equity method and our weather and energy risk management operations are included in the other category of our segment results 
individual risk we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the original underlying insurance policy 
our principal contracts currently include insurance contracts and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including crop insurance  which includes multi peril crop insurance  crop hail and other named peril agriculture risk management products  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 
our individual risk business is primarily produced through four distribution channels wholly owned program managers where we write primary insurance through our own subsidiaries  third party program managers where we write primary insurance through third party program managers  who produce business pursuant to agreed upon underwriting guidelines and provide related back office functions  quota share reinsurance where we write quota share reinsurance with primary insurers who  similar to our third party program managers  provide most of the back office and support functions  and brokers and agents where we write primary insurance produced through licensed intermediaries on a risk by risk basis 

table of contents our individual risk business is principally written through glencoe and lantana  which write on an excess and surplus lines basis  and through stonington and stonington lloyd s  which write on an admitted basis 
since the inception of our individual risk business  we have substantially relied on third parties for services including the generation of premium  the issuance of policies and the processing of claims  though as previously disclosed  we have internalized an increasing amount of these services over the past two years 
we principally oversee our third party partners through a program operations team at renre north america inc  which conducts initial due diligence as well as ongoing monitoring 
establishment of syndicate and acquisition of spectrum in may  we established syndicate  a lloyd s syndicate  to start writing certain lines of insurance and reinsurance business incepting on or after june  the syndicate was established to enhance our underwriting platform by providing access to lloyd s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses 
renaissancere ccl  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is the sole corporate member of syndicate on june   we entered into a definitive agreement granting us an option to purchase all of the outstanding shares of spectrum partners  the parent company and sole owner of spectrum  now known as rsml  and spectrum insurance services ltd 
on november   the company acquired of the outstanding and issued common shares of spectrum partners 
prior to acquiring the outstanding and issued common shares of spectrum partners  the company had contracted with spectrum to be the managing agent of syndicate spectrum partners is based in london  uk  and prior to the company s acquisition  was an independent lloyd s managing agency that provided the requisite services mandated for entrants into the lloyd s market 
one of the requirements to enter the lloyd s market and establish an underwriting syndicate is to obtain the services of a managing agent 
generally  new entrants either solicit the services of a managing agency  such as spectrum  or acquire an existing managing agent 
the results of syndicate and spectrum were not significant to our overall consolidated results of operations and financial position for new business in addition to the potential growth of our existing reinsurance and insurance businesses  from time to time we consider diversification into new ventures  either through organic growth  the formation of new joint ventures  or the acquisition of or the investment in other companies or books of business of other companies 
this potential diversification includes opportunities to write targeted  additional classes of risk exposed business  both directly for our own account and through possible new joint venture opportunities 
we also regularly evaluate opportunities to grow our business by utilizing our skills  capabilities  proprietary technology and relationships to expand into further risk related coverages  services and products 
generally  we focus on underwriting or trading risks where reasonably sufficient data may be available  and where our analytical abilities may provide us a competitive advantage  in order for us to seek to model estimated probabilities of losses and returns in accordance with our approach in respect of our current portfolio of risks 
we also regularly review potential new investments  in both operating entities and financial instruments 
in evaluating potential new ventures or investments  we generally seek an attractive estimated return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities which we believe will not detract from our core reinsurance and individual risk operations 
accordingly  we regularly review strategic opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible transactions  although there can be no assurance that we will complete any such transactions or that any such transaction would be successful or contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that our ability to potentially attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources  and by the capabilities and track record of our ventures unit 

table of contents summary of critical accounting estimates claims and claim expense reserves general description we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 
the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the years ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax expense 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss 
table of contents and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
we recorded million of gross claims and claim expenses incurred in the third quarter of as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the us in the third quarter of our estimates of losses from hurricanes gustav and ike are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain customers and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
given the magnitude and relatively recent occurrence of these events  as well as the large storms of  including hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  our actual net losses from these events and katrina may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
our actual losses from these events and katrina  will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by customers and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
included in our results for are million of net claims and claim expenses from kyrill and the uk flood losses which occurred in  as well as million in estimated losses associated with exposure to sub prime related casualty losses 
estimates of these losses are based on a review of potentially exposed contracts  information reported by and discussions with counterparties  and the company s estimate of losses related to those contracts and are subject to change as more information is reported and becomes available 
such information is frequently reported more slowly  and with less initial accuracy  with respect to non us events such as kyrill and the non us floods than with large us catastrophe losses 
in addition  the sub prime related casualty net claims and claim expenses are based on underlying liability contracts which are considered long tail business  and will therefore take many years before the actual losses are known and reported  which increases the uncertainty with respect to the estimate for ultimate losses for this event 
the net claims and claim expenses from kyrill  the uk floods and sub prime related casualty losses are all attributable to the company s reinsurance segment 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
following is a discussion of the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units 
reinsurance segment property catastrophe reinsurance within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit  we principally write property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts to insure insurance and reinsurance companies against natural and man made catastrophes 
under these contracts  we indemnify an insurer or reinsurer when its aggregate paid claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the attachment point specified in the contract  up to an amount per loss specified in the contract 
our most significant exposure is to losses from earthquakes and hurricanes and other windstorms  although we are also exposed to claims arising from other catastrophes  such as tsunamis  freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes  explosions and acts of terrorism 
our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage 
however  other risks  including business interruption and other non property losses  may also be covered under our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril 
our coverages are offered on either a worldwide basis or are limited to selected geographic areas 

table of contents coverage can also vary from all property perils to limited coverage on selected perils  such as earthquake only coverage 
we also enter into retrocessional contracts that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedants 
this coverage is generally in the form of excess of loss retrocessional contracts and may cover all perils and exposures on a worldwide basis or be limited in scope to selected geographic areas  perils and or exposures 
the exposures we assume from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a retrocedant may alter their book of business after the retrocessional coverage has been bound 
we also offer dual trigger reinsurance contracts which require us to pay claims based on claims incurred by insurers and reinsurers in addition to the estimate of insured industry losses as reported by referenced statistical reporting agencies 
our property catastrophe reinsurance business is generally characterized by loss events of low frequency and high severity 
initial reporting of paid and incurred claims in general  tends to be relatively prompt 
we consider this business short tail as compared to the reporting of claims for long tail products  which tends to be slower 
however  the timing of claims payment and reporting also varies depending on various factors  including whether the claims arise under reinsurance of primary insurance companies or reinsurance of other reinsurance companies  the nature of the events eg  hurricanes  earthquakes or terrorism  the geographic area involved  post event inflation which may cause the cost to repair damaged property to increase significantly from current estimates  or for property claims to remain open for a longer period of time  due to limitations on the supply of building materials  labor and other resources  complex policy coverage and other legal issues  and the quality of each client s claims management and reserving practices 
management s judgments regarding these factors are reflected in our claims reserve estimates 
reserving for most of our property catastrophe reinsurance business does not involve the use of traditional actuarial techniques 
rather  claims and claim expense reserves are estimated by management after a catastrophe occurs by completing an in depth analysis of the individual contracts which may potentially be impacted by the catastrophic event 
the in depth analysis generally involves estimating the size of insured industry losses from the catastrophic event  reviewing our portfolio of reinsurance contracts to identify those contracts which are exposed to the catastrophic event  reviewing information reported by customers and brokers  discussing the event with our customers and brokers  and estimating the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs arising from the catastrophic event on a contract by contract basis and in aggregate for the event 
once an event has occurred  during the then current reporting period we record our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims arising from the event 
our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves is then determined by deducting cumulative paid losses from our estimate of the ultimate expected loss for an event and our estimate of ibnr is determined by deducting cumulative paid losses  case reserves and additional case reserves from our estimate of the ultimate expected loss for an event 
once we receive a notice of loss or payment request under a catastrophe reinsurance contract  we are generally able to process and pay such claims promptly 
because the events from which claims arise under policies written by our property catastrophe reinsurance business are typically prominent  public occurrences such as hurricanes and earthquakes  we are often able to use independent reports as part of our loss reserve estimation process 
we also review catastrophe bulletins published by various statistical reporting agencies to assist us in determining the size of the industry loss  although these reports may not be available for some time after an event 
in addition to the loss information and estimates communicated by cedants and brokers  we also use industry information which we gather and retain in our rems modeling system 
the information stored in our rems modeling system enables us to analyze each of our policies in relation to a loss and compare our estimate of the loss with those reported by our policyholders 
the rems modeling system also allows us to compare and analyze individual losses reported by policyholders affected by the same loss event 
although the rems modeling system assists with the analysis of the underlying loss and provides us with the information and ability to perform increased analysis  the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty associated with property catastrophe claims and the unique characteristics of each loss 
for smaller events including localized severe weather events such as windstorms  hail  ice  snow  flooding  freezing and tornadoes  which are not necessarily prominent  public occurrences  we initially place greater reliance on catastrophe bulletins published by statistical reporting agencies to assist us in determining what events occurred during the reporting period than we do for large events 
this includes reviewing catastrophe bulletins published by property claim services for us catastrophes 
we set our initial estimates of reserves for claims and claim expenses for these smaller events based on a combination of our historical market share for these types of losses and the estimate of the total insured industry property losses as reported by statistical 
table of contents reporting agencies  although we generally make significant adjustments based on our current exposure to the geographic region involved as well as the size of the loss and the peril involved 
this approach supplements our approach for estimating losses for larger catastrophes  which as discussed above  includes discussions with brokers and ceding companies  reviewing individual contracts impacted by the event  and modeling the loss in our rems system 
approximately one year from the date of loss for these small events  we estimate ibnr for these events by using an actuarial technique 
the actuarial technique is to use a paid bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique in estimating ibnr 
the paid bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique loss development factors are selected based on a review of our historical experience and these factors are reviewed at least annually 
there were no changes to the paid loss development factors over the last three years 
in general  our property catastrophe reinsurance reserves for our more recent reinsured catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater potential variability  and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  uncertainty due to complex legal and coverage issues that can arise out of large or complex catastrophic events such as the events of september  and hurricane katrina  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our customers 
as our property catastrophe reinsurance claims age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as seen in the actual vs 
initial estimated property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis table below  of our inception to date claims and claim expenses in our property catastrophe reinsurance unit were incurred in the  and accident years  due principally to the losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan  jeanne  katrina  rita  wilma  gustav and ike 
due to the size and complexity of the losses in these accident years  there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the ultimate settlement costs associated with these accident years 
in  we reviewed our processes and methodology for estimating the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims arising from certain mature large us hurricanes 
during this process  we evaluated several actuarial methodologies including using paid loss development factors  reported loss development factors and ratios of ibnr to case reserves 
in this review  among other things  we looked at our historical claims experience on these mature large us hurricanes  the number of claims associated with these mature large us hurricanes and available industry claims information on the same or similar events 
we determined that the use of the reported loss development factor methodology for these mature large us hurricanes would provide us with the best estimate of ultimate losses in respect of these events 
currently  we believe this approach is only applicable for the and large hurricanes as we believe that i these events have a large enough number of reported claims to be statistically sound  ii these events have available industry reported claims information to supplement our own historical reported loss information  and iii a sufficient amount of time has passed from the date of loss that the use of an actuarial method could assist in estimating the ultimate costs 
we implemented this actuarial methodology in the fourth quarter of with respect to our and hurricane losses 
in the future  we expect to evaluate applying this methodology to other mature large us hurricanes as we deem appropriate 
in implementing this actuarial technique  we adjusted our ultimate losses at december  on the hurricanes from reported to reported and from reported to reported for the hurricanes 
the impact of these changes within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit was a decrease in ultimate losses on the hurricanes by million and by million for our hurricane losses 
the net positive impact to our financial results was million after considering offsetting changes in reinsurance recoveries  reinstatement premiums  profit commissions and redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire 
within our property catastrophe reinsurance business  we seek to review our claims and claim expense reserves quarterly 
our quarterly review procedures include identifying events that have occurred up to the latest balance sheet date  determining our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs associated with those new events which have arisen during the reporting period  reviewing the ultimate expected cost to settle claims and administrative costs associated with those events which occurred during previous periods  and considering new estimation techniques  such as additional actuarial methods or other statistical techniques  that can assist us in developing a best estimate 
this process is judgmental in that it involves reviewing changes in paid and reported losses each period and adjusting our estimates of the ultimate expected losses for each event if there are developments that are different from our previous expectations 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the years ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our property catastrophe reinsurance unit increased our net income by 
table of contents million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax expense 
the favorable development within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit of million in was principally attributable to a reduction in ultimate net losses associated with the hurricanes  gustav and ike million  the hurricanes  katrina  rita and wilma million  the european windstorm kyrill million  the california wildfires million  the flooding in the uk million  and the hurricanes  charley  frances  ivan and jeanne million  due to better than expected reported claims activity  and with respect to the and hurricanes  the adoption of a new actuarial technique using reported loss development factors to estimate the ultimate losses for these events  as discussed in more detail above 
the remaining favorable development within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit was due to a reduction of ultimate net losses on a variety of smaller catastrophes such as hail storms  winter freezes  floods  fires  tornadoes which occurred during the through accident years 
our favorable development on prior years estimated ultimate claim reserves in our property catastrophe reinsurance unit of million in was principally as a result of a comprehensive review of the company s expected ultimate net losses associated with the hurricanes  katrina  rita and wilma  which resulted in an million decrease in net losses from these events 
the comprehensive review of the hurricanes included a case by case review of the claims for our largest outstanding additional case reserves by cedant for each hurricane  reviewing updated information received from customers  brokers and other industry sources regarding these claims  reviewing industry paid and reported loss development patterns for hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and comparing these statistics to our paid and reported loss development patterns for these events  and reviewing our historical experience for previous large catastrophes  including the hurricanes 
based on the work completed  we determined to reduce our current best estimate of the ultimate net losses arising from these events by million 
the million decrease in ultimate net losses was comprised of a million decrease in additional case reserves and a million decrease in ibnr and partially offset by a corresponding million decrease in losses recoverable 
we did not change our reserving methodology in as a result of this review 
actual results vs 
initial estimates the table below summarizes our initial assumptions and changes in those assumptions for claims and claim expense reserves within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
as discussed above  the key assumption in estimating reserves for our property catastrophe reinsurance unit is our estimate of ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the table shows our initial estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses for each accident year and how these initial estimates have developed over time 
the initial estimate of accident year claims and claim expenses represents our estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims incurred from catastrophic events occurring during a particular accident year  and as reported as of december of that year 
the re estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december   and  represent our revised estimates as reported as of those dates 
the cumulative favorable adverse development shows how our most recent estimates as reported at december  differ from our initial accident year estimates 
favorable development implies that our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates while adverse development implies that our current estimates are higher than our original estimates 
total reserves as of december  reflect the unpaid portion of our estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the table is presented on a gross basis and therefore does not include the benefit of reinsurance recoveries 
it also does not consider the impact of loss related premium or redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire 

table of contents actual vs 
initial estimated property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis in thousands  except percentages accident year initial estimate of accident year claims and claim expenses re estimated claims and claim expenses as of december  cumulative favorable adverse development decrease increase from initial ultimate claims and claim expense reserves as of december  of claims and claim expenses unpaid as of december  as quantified in the table above  since the inception of the company in  while we have experienced adverse development from time to time  on a cumulative basis we have experienced million of favorable development on the run off of our gross reserves within our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
this represents of our initial estimated gross claims and claim expenses for accident years and prior of billion and is calculated based on our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves as of december   compared to our initial estimates of ultimate claims and claim expenses  as of the end of each accident year 
as described above  given the complexity in reserving for claims and claims expenses associated with catastrophe losses for property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts  we have experienced development  both favorable and unfavorable  in any given accident year in amounts that exceed our inception to date percentage of 
for example  our accident year developed favorably by million  which is better than our initial estimates of claims and claim expenses for the accident year as estimated as of december   while our accident year developed unfavorably by million  or 
on a net basis our cumulative favorable or unfavorable development is generally reduced by offsetting changes in our reinsurance recoverables  as well as changes to loss related premiums such as reinstatement premiums  and redeemable noncontrolling interest for changes in claims and claim expenses that impact davincire  all of which generally move in the opposite direction to changes in our ultimate claims and claim expenses 
the percentage of claims unpaid at december  for each accident year reflects both the speed at which claims and claim expenses for each accident year have been paid and our estimate of claims and claim expenses for that accident year 
as seen above  claims and claim expenses for the accident year have to date been paid quickly compared to prior accident years 
this is due to the fact that hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne which occurred in have been relatively rapid claims paying events 
this is driven in part by the mix of our business in florida  which primarily includes property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance for personal lines property coverage  rather than commercial property coverage or retrocessional coverage  and the speed of the settlement and payment of claims by our underlying cedants 
in contrast  our accident year  which includes losses from the events of september   and our accident year  which includes significant losses from hurricane katrina  includes a higher mix of commercial business and retrocessional coverage where the underlying claims of our cedants tend to be settled and paid more slowly 
in addition  claims from our underlying cedants for the and accident years are subject to more complex coverage and legal matters due to the complexity of the catastrophic events taking place in those years 

table of contents sensitivity analysis the table below shows the impact on our ultimate claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity as of and for the year ended december  of reasonably likely changes to our estimates of ultimate losses for claims and claim expenses incurred from catastrophic events within our property catastrophe reinsurance business unit 
the reasonably likely changes are based on an historical analysis of the period to period variability of our ultimate costs to settle claims from catastrophic events  giving due consideration to changes in our reserving practices over time 
in general  our claim reserves for our more recent catastrophic events are subject to greater uncertainty and  therefore  greater variability and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next 
this is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses from the event  uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed to the catastrophic event  and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our clients 
as our claims age  more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain  although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future 
as a result  the sensitivity analysis below is based on the age of each accident year  our current estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses for the catastrophic events occurring in each accident year  and the reasonably likely variability of our current estimates of claims and claim expenses by accident year 
the impact on net income and shareholders equity assumes no increase or decrease in reinsurance recoveries  loss related premium or redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire 
property catastrophe reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve sensitivity analysis in thousands  except percentages ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december  impact of change in ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december  impact of change in ultimate claims and claim expenses as of december  impact of change on net income for the year ended december  impact of change on shareholders equity as of december  higher recorded lower we believe the changes we made to our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses represent reasonably likely outcomes based on our experience to date and our future expectations 
while we believe these are reasonably likely outcomes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  the sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes in our underlying assumptions 
it is possible that our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses could be significantly higher or lower than the sensitivity analysis described above 
for example  we could be liable for events for which we have not estimated claims and claim expenses or for exposures we do not currently believe are covered under our policies 
these changes could result in significantly larger changes to our estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 
specialty reinsurance within our specialty reinsurance business unit we write a number of reinsurance lines such as catastrophe exposed workers compensation  surety  terrorism  political risk  trade credit  medical malpractice  catastrophe exposed personal lines property  casualty clash  property per risk  catastrophe exposed personal lines property and other specialty lines of reinsurance  which we collectively refer to as specialty reinsurance 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products principally on an excess of loss basis  as described above with respect to our property catastrophe reinsurance products  and we also provide some proportional coverage 
in a proportional reinsurance arrangement also referred to as quota share reinsurance or pro rata reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured 
we offer our specialty reinsurance products to insurance companies and other reinsurance companies and provide coverage for specific geographic regions or on a worldwide basis 
we expanded our specialty reinsurance business in and have increased our presence in the specialty reinsurance market since that time 
our specialty reinsurance business can generally be characterized as providing coverage for low frequency and high severity losses  similar to our property catastrophe reinsurance business 
as with our property catastrophe reinsurance business  our specialty reinsurance contracts frequently provide coverage for relatively large limits or exposures 
as a result of the foregoing  our specialty reinsurance business is subject to significant claims 
table of contents volatility 
in periods of low claims frequency or severity  our results will generally be favorably impacted while in periods of high claims frequency or severity our results will generally be negatively impacted 
our processes and methodologies in respect of loss estimation for the coverages we offer through our specialty reinsurance operation differ from those used for our property catastrophe oriented coverages 
for example  our specialty reinsurance coverages are more likely to be impacted by factors such as long term inflation and changes in the social and legal environment  which we believe gives rise to greater uncertainty in our claims reserves 
moreover  in reserving for our specialty reinsurance coverages we do not have the benefit of a significant amount of our own historical experience in certain of these lines 
we believe this makes our specialty reinsurance reserving subject to greater uncertainty than our property catastrophe reinsurance unit 
when initially developing our reserving techniques for our specialty reinsurance coverages  we considered estimating reserves utilizing several actuarial techniques such as paid and reported loss development methods 
we elected to use the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique because this method is appropriate for lines of business  such as our specialty reinsurance business  where there is a lack of historical claims experience 
this method allows for greater weight to be applied to expected results in periods where little or no actual experience is available  and  hence  is less susceptible to the potential pitfall of being excessively swayed by one year or one quarter of actual paid and or reported loss data 
this method uses initial expected loss ratio expectations to the extent that losses are not paid or reported  and it assumes that past experience is not fully representative of the future 
as the company s reserves for claims and claim expenses age  and actual claims experience becomes available  this method places less weight on expected experience and places more weight on actual experience 
we reevaluate our actuarial reserving techniques on a periodic basis 
the utilization of the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique requires us to estimate an expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and select an expected loss reporting pattern 
we select our estimates of the expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and expected loss reporting patterns by reviewing industry standards and adjusting these standards based upon the terms of the coverages we offer 
the estimated expected claims and claim expense ratio may be modified to the extent that reported losses at a given point in time differ from what would be expected based on the selected loss reporting pattern 
our estimate of ibnr is the product of the premium we have earned  the initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio and the percentage of estimated unreported losses 
in addition  certain of our specialty reinsurance coverages may be impacted by natural and man made catastrophes 
we estimate claim reserves for these losses after the event giving rise to these losses occur  following a process that is similar to our property catastrophe reinsurance unit described above 
within our specialty reinsurance business  we seek to review substantially all of our claims and claim expense reserves quarterly 
typically  our quarterly review procedures include reviewing paid and reported claims in the most recent reporting period  reviewing the development of paid and reported claims from prior periods  and reviewing our overall experience by underwriting year and in the aggregate 
we monitor our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and expected loss reporting assumptions on a quarterly basis and compare them to our actual experience 
these actuarial assumptions are generally reviewed annually  based on input from our actuaries  underwriters  claims personnel and finance professionals  although adjustments may be made more frequently if needed 
assumption changes are made to adjust for changes in the pricing and terms of coverage we provide  changes in industry standards  as well as our actual experience  to the extent we have enough data to rely on our own experience 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the years ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our specialty reinsurance unit increased our net income by million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax expense 
the favorable development within our specialty reinsurance unit of million in was principally attributable to lower than expected claims emergence on the through underwriting years of million which was driven by the application of our formulaic actuarial reserving methodology for this business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being more favorable to date than what was originally anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves  as well as million due to a reduction on one claim on a contract related to the hurricanes  and partially offset by a million increase in our estimated ultimate net losses on the madoff matter 

table of contents actual results vs 
initial estimates the actual vs 
initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio table below summarizes our key actuarial assumptions in reserving for our specialty reinsurance business 
as noted above  the key actuarial assumptions include the estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and the estimated loss reporting patterns 
the table shows our initial estimates of the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio by underwriting year 
the table shows how our initial estimates of these ratios have developed over time  with the re estimated ratios reflecting a combination of the amount and timing of paid and reported losses compared to our initial estimates 
the initial estimate is based on the actuarial assumptions that were in place at the end of that year 
a decrease in the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio implies that our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates while an increase in the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio implies that our current estimates are higher than our initial estimates 
the result would be a corresponding favorable impact on shareholders equity and net income or a corresponding unfavorable impact on shareholders equity and net income  respectively 
the table also shows how our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have changed from one underwriting year to the next 
the table below reflects a summary of the weighted average assumptions for all classes of business written within our specialty reinsurance unit 
the table is presented on a gross loss basis and therefore does not include the benefit of reinsurance recoveries or loss related premium 
actual vs 
initial estimated specialty reinsurance claims and claim expense reserve analysis estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio estimated ultimate claims and claim expenses ratio underwriting year initial estimate re estimate as of december  december  december  the table above shows our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios for attritional losses for each new underwriting year within our specialty reinsurance unit as of the end of each calendar year 
until  our initial estimated ultimate remained relatively constant between in and in and this reflects the fact that management had not made significant changes to its initial estimates of expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios from one underwriting year to the next 
the principal reason for the modest changes from one underwriting year to the next is that the mix of business has changed 
for example  the mix of business for the  and underwriting years have a lower initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio than in prior years as it is more heavily weighted to business that is expected to produce a lower level of losses 
the decrease in the initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio from to also reflects assumption changes made for certain classes of business where our experience  and the industry experience in general  has been better than expected and  as a result  we decreased our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for these classes of business 
the increase in the initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for  compared to  is principally due to a shift in the mix of business to higher expected loss ratio business as our modeled expected loss ratio assumptions did not change 
as each underwriting year has developed  our re estimated expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have changed 
in particular  our re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have decreased significantly from the initial estimates for the through underwriting years 
this was principally due to our reserve review 
during our reserve review  we further segmented the specialty business with the aim of grouping risks into more homogeneous categories which respond to the evolution of actual exposures 
this became possible as the volume of this business increased over the three preceding years 
this further segmentation required the selection of loss reporting patterns to be applied to these new groups 
we also updated our assumptions for our original loss reporting patterns based on a combination of new industry information and actual experience accumulated over the three preceding years 
the assumptions for the new loss reporting patterns were applied to all prior underwriting years 
in addition  we made explicit allowances for commuted contracts whereas previously these were considered in the overall reserving assumptions 
we also 
table of contents reviewed substantially all of our case reserves and additional case reserves 
the result of the foregoing was a decrease in our specialty reinsurance re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense reserves in subsequent to this reserve review  the results of our specialty book of business have been mixed 
the underwriting year includes favorable development as actual paid and reported losses during have been less than expected  which has resulted in a reduction in our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for this year 
however  the and underwriting years have performed worse than expected and our current estimates are higher than our initial estimates 
this is due in part to the losses in our casualty clash line of business in and  associated with exposure to the deterioration of the credit and capital markets in as well as the madoff matter discovered in the fourth quarter of and with sub prime exposure in as noted above  our specialty reinsurance business is characterized by events of low frequency and high severity which results in actual experience that can be significantly better or worse than long term trends or industry standards may imply 
as noted above  some of our specialty reinsurance contracts are exposed to net claims and claim expenses from large natural and man made catastrophes 
net claims and claim expenses from these large catastrophes are reserved for after the events which gave rise to the claims in a manner which is consistent with our property catastrophe reinsurance reserving practices as discussed above 
the large catastrophes occurring during the period from to impacting our specialty unit principally include hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which occurred in our estimate of ultimate net claims and claim expenses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  within our specialty reinsurance unit  net of reinsurance recoveries and assumed and ceded loss related premium  totaled million  million  million  million and million at december     and  respectively 
sensitivity analysis the table below quantifies the impact on our reserves for claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity as of and for the year ended december  of reasonably likely changes to the actuarial assumptions used to estimate our december  claims and claim expense reserves within our specialty reinsurance business unit 
the table quantifies reasonably likely changes in our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and estimated loss reporting patterns 
the changes to the initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios represent percentage increases or decreases to our current estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios 
the change to the reporting patterns represent claims reporting that is both faster and slower than our current estimated claims reporting patterns 
the impact on net income and shareholders equity assumes no increase or decrease in reinsurance recoveries  loss related premium or redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire

table of contents we believe that ultimate claims and claim expense ratios above or below our estimated assumptions constitute reasonably likely outcomes based on our experience to date and our future expectations 
in addition  we believe that the adjustments that we made to speed up or slow down our estimated loss reporting patterns are reasonably likely changes 
while we believe these are reasonably likely changes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  we caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes 
it is possible that our initial estimated claims and claim expense ratios and loss reporting patterns could be significantly different from the sensitivity analysis described above 
for example  we could be liable for events which we have not estimated reserves for or for exposures we do not currently think are covered under our contracts 
these changes could result in significantly larger changes to reserves for claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 
individual risk segment we define our individual risk segment to include underwriting that involves understanding the characteristics of the underlying insurance policy 
our principal contracts currently include insurance policies and quota share reinsurance with respect to risks including crop insurance  which includes multi peril crop insurance  crop hail and other named peril agriculture risk management products  commercial property  which principally includes catastrophe exposed commercial property products  commercial multi line  which includes commercial property and liability coverage  such as general liability  automobile liability and physical damage  building and contents  professional liability and various specialty products  and personal lines property  which principally includes homeowners personal lines property coverage and catastrophe exposed personal lines property coverage 
we use the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique to estimate claims and claim expenses within our individual risk segment for our property and casualty business 
the comments discussed above relating to our reserving techniques and processes for our specialty reinsurance unit also apply to our individual risk segment 
in addition  certain of our coverages may be impacted by natural and man made catastrophes 
we estimate claim reserves for these losses after the event giving rise to these losses occurs  following a process that is similar to our property catastrophe reinsurance unit including  starting in  the use of reported loss development factors for the and large hurricanes  as described in more detail above 
in addition  for our crop insurance business we estimate our claims and claim expenses using an expected loss ratio method 
our expected loss ratio is developed based on our current best estimate of the ultimate costs to settle all claims arising out of the risks we have covered under these policies and takes into consideration our historical experience  historical industry experience  current and estimated future commodity prices  as well as events which have occurred which are estimated to impact future crop yields such as droughts  hail  windstorms and flooding 
reserving for our crop insurance business is generally much more uncertain in the first few quarters after the issuance of a policy due to the difficulty in estimating the aforementioned variables  but since principally all claims have historically been settled within fifteen months of the issuance of a policy this uncertainty is generally resolved in a relatively short period of time compared to other insurance lines of business 
during the years ended december   and  changes to our prior year estimated claims reserves in our individual risk unit decreased our net income by million  increased our net income by million and increased our net income by million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions and income tax expense 
the adverse development within our individual risk segment of million in was principally driven by million of adverse development in our crop insurance business primarily due to an increase in the severity of reported loss activity in on the crop year 
this more than offset a million reduction in ultimate net losses on the and hurricanes principally due to the adoption of a new actuarial technique using reported loss development factors to estimate the ultimate losses for these events  as discussed in more detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  summary of critical accounting estimates  claims and claim expense reserves  individual risk  million of favorable development due to changes in actuarial assumptions and million of favorable development principally driven by the application of our formulaic actuarial reserving methodology for this business with the reductions being due to actual paid and reported loss activity being more favorable to date than what was originally anticipated when setting the initial ibnr reserves 

table of contents actual results vs 
initial estimates the actual vs 
initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio table below summarizes our key actuarial assumptions in reserving for our individual risk segment 
as noted above  the key actuarial assumptions include the estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and the estimated loss reporting patterns 
the table shows our initial estimates of the ultimate claims and claim expense ratios by accident year 
the table shows how our initial estimates of these ratios have developed over time with the re estimated ratios reflecting a combination of the amount and timing of paid and reported losses compared to our initial estimates 
the initial estimate is based on the actuarial assumptions that were in place at the end of that year 
a decrease in the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio implies that our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates while an increase in the ultimate claims and claim expense ratio implies that our current estimates are higher than our initial estimates 
the result would be a corresponding favorable impact on shareholders equity and net income or a corresponding unfavorable impact on shareholders equity and net income  respectively 
the table also shows how our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have changed from one accident year to the next 
the table below reflects a summary of the weighted average assumptions for all classes of business written within our individual risk segment 
the table is presented on a gross loss basis and therefore does not include the benefit of reinsurance recoveries or loss related premium 
actual vs 
initial estimated individual risk segment claims and claim expense reserve analysis estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio estimated expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio initial estimate re estimate as of accident year december  december  december  the table above shows that our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios for attritional losses for each new accident year within our individual risk segment as of the end of each calendar year  have historically stayed relatively constant between and this reflects the fact that management has not made significant changes to its estimated initial expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio from one period to the next 
the principal reason for the changes from one year to the next is that the mix of business has changed 
for example  during  our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratio increased relative to the preceding five years  as a result of the increase in our crop insurance business which has a higher net claims and claim expenses ratio relative to the other lines of business within the individual risk segment and comprises a larger percentage of our overall individual risk premiums 
as each accident year has developed  our re estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios have generally been reduced 
this reflects the impact of actual experience in our individual risk business where actual paid and reported losses to date for attritional losses are less than originally expected 
as described above  under the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial technique less weight is placed on initial estimates and more weight is placed on actual experience as our claims and claim expense reserves age 

table of contents as noted above  some of our individual risk contracts are exposed to net claims and claim expenses from large natural and man made catastrophes 
net claims and claim expenses from these large catastrophes are reserved for after the event which gave rise to the claims in a manner which is consistent with our property catastrophe reinsurance reserving practices as discussed above 
the large catastrophes occurring during the period from to principally include hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne in  hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma in  and hurricanes gustav and ike in our ultimate net claims and claim expenses from these events within our individual risk segment  net of reinsurance recoveries and assumed and ceded loss related premium  are shown in the table below 
in thousands estimated net claims and claim expenses events as of december  of the applicable accident year december  december  december  charley  frances  ivan and jeanne katrina  rita and wilma gustav and ike sensitivity analysis the table below quantifies the impact on our reserves for claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity as of and for the year ended december  of reasonably likely changes to the actuarial assumptions used to estimate our december  claims and claim expense reserves within our individual risk segment 
the table quantifies reasonably likely changes in our initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios and estimated loss reporting patterns 
the changes to the initial estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios represent percentage increases or decreases to our current estimated ultimate claims and claim expense ratios 
the change to the reporting patterns represent claims reporting that is both faster and slower than our current estimated reporting patterns 
the impact on net income and shareholders equity assumes no increase or decrease in reinsurance recoveries or loss related premium and is before tax

table of contents we believe that ultimate claims and claim expense ratios above or below our estimated assumptions constitute reasonably likely outcomes based on our experience to date and our future expectations 
in addition  we believe that the adjustments that we made to speed up or slow down our estimated loss reporting patterns are reasonably likely changes 
while we believe these are reasonably likely changes  we do not believe the reader should consider the above sensitivity analysis an actuarial reserve range 
in addition  we caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis only reflects reasonably likely changes 
it is possible that our initial estimated claims and claim expense ratios and loss reporting patterns could be significantly different from the sensitivity analysis described above 
for example  we could be liable for events which we have not estimated reserves for or for exposures we do not currently think are covered under our contracts 
these changes could result in significantly larger changes to our reserves for claims and claim expenses  net income and shareholders equity than those noted above 
we also caution the reader that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business 
losses recoverable we enter into reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related assumed reinsurance 
for multi year retrospectively rated contracts  we accrue amounts either assets or liabilities that are due to or from assuming companies based on estimated contract experience 
if we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
the estimate of losses recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under the heading claims and claim expense reserves above 
in particular  losses recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance  industry losses reported by various statistical reporting services  and other factors 
losses recoverable on dual trigger reinsurance contracts require us to estimate our ultimate losses applicable to these contracts as well as estimate the ultimate amount of insured losses for the industry as a whole that will be reported by the applicable statistical reporting agency  as per the contract terms 
in addition  the level of our additional case reserves and ibnr reserves has a significant impact on losses recoverable 
these factors can impact the amount and timing of the losses recoverable to be recorded 
the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until some point in the future 
the amounts recoverable ultimately collected are open to uncertainty due to the ultimate ability and willingness of reinsurers to pay our claims  for reasons including insolvency and elective run off  contractual dispute and various other reasons 
in addition  because the majority of the balances recoverable will not be collected for some time  economic conditions as well as the financial and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may change  and these changes may affect the reinsurer s willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
to reflect these uncertainties  we estimate and record a valuation allowance for potential uncollectible losses recoverable which reduces losses recoverable and net earnings 
we estimate our valuation allowance by applying specific percentages against each recovery based on our counterparty s credit rating 
the percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates 
we also apply case specific valuation allowances against certain recoveries that we deem unlikely to be collected in full 
we then evaluate the overall adequacy of the valuation allowance based on other qualitative and judgmental factors 
the valuation allowance recorded against losses recoverable was million at december  million 
the reinsurers with the three largest balances accounted for  and  respectively  of our losses recoverable balance at december   and  respectively 
the three largest company specific components of the valuation allowance represented  and  respectively  of our total valuation allowance at december   and  respectively 
fair value measurements and impairments fair value the use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses is pervasive within our financial statements  and is a critical accounting policy and estimate for us 
fair value is defined under 
table of contents accounting guidance currently applicable to us to be the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between open market participants at the measurement date 
we recognize the change in unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations  with the exception of changes in unrealized gains and losses on our fixed maturity investments available for sale  which are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures prescribes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the respective valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below fair values determined by level inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices obtained from active markets for identical assets or liabilities for which the company has access to 
the fair value is determined by multiplying the quoted price by the quantity held by the company  fair values determined by level inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals  broker quotes and certain pricing indices  and level inputs are based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
in these cases  significant management assumptions can be used to establish management s best estimate of the assumptions used by other market participants in determining the fair value of the asset or liability 
the fair value of certain of our other investments  which principally include hedge funds  private equity partnerships  senior secured bank loan funds and non us fixed income funds  is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments  if applicable 
these net asset valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of our fund investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
in addition  due to a lag in reporting  some of our fund managers  fund administrators  or both  are unable to provide final fund valuations as of our current reporting date 
in these circumstances  we estimate the fair value of these funds by starting with the prior month s or quarter s fund valuation  adjusting these valuations for capital calls  redemptions or distributions and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and then estimating the return for the current period 
in circumstances in which we estimate the return for the current period  we use all credible information available to us 
this principally includes preliminary estimates reported to us by our fund managers  obtaining the valuation of underlying portfolio investments where such underlying investments are publicly traded and therefore have a readily observable price  using information that is available to us with respect to the underlying investments  reviewing various indices for similar investments or asset classes  as well as estimating returns based on the results of similar types of investments for which we have reported results  or other valuation methods  as necessary 
actual final fund valuations may differ from our estimates  perhaps materially so  and these differences are recorded in the period they become known as a change in estimate 
our estimate of the fair value of catastrophe bonds are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications 
in order to determine if a market is active or inactive for a security  we consider a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the spread between what a seller is asking for a security and what a buyer is bidding for the same security  the volume of trading activity for the security in question  the price of the security compared to its par value for fixed maturity investments  and other factors that may be indicative of market activity 
see note fair value measurements in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about fair value measurements 

table of contents below is a summary of the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and also represents the carrying amount of such assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at december  total quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level in thousands assets fixed maturity investments short term investments other investments other secured assets other assets percentage of total fair value assets and liabilities other assets of million  million and million are included in level  level and level  respectively 
other liabilities of million  million and million are included in level  level and level  respectively 
as at december   we classified million and million of assets and liabilities  respectively  at fair value on a recurring basis using level inputs 
this represented and of our total assets and liabilities  respectively 
level fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable 
these measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
we use valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms  market prices and rates  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs  some of which may be unobservable  to value these level assets and liabilities 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment 
in making the assessment  we considered factors specific to the asset or liability 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability 
impairments the amount and timing of asset impairment is subject to significant estimation techniques and asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate for us 
the more significant impairment reviews we complete are for our fixed maturity investments available for sale  equity method investments and goodwill and other intangible assets as described in more detail below 
fixed maturity investments available for sale pursuant to new authoritative gaap guidance effective april   we revised our quarterly process for assessing whether declines in the fair value of our fixed maturity investments available for sale represent impairments that are other than temporary 
the process now includes reviewing each fixed maturity investment available for sale that is impaired and determining i if we have the intent to sell the debt security or ii if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  and iii assessing whether a credit loss exists  that is  where we expect that the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security are less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
in assessing our intent to sell securities  our procedures may include actions such as discussing planned sales with our third party investment managers  reviewing sales that have occurred shortly after the balance sheet date  and consideration of other qualitative factors that may be indicative of our intent to sell or hold the relevant securities 
the company recognized a total of million of other than temporary impairments due to our intent to sell these securities during the year ended december  
table of contents in assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before its anticipated recovery  we consider various factors including our future cash flow forecasts and requirements  legal and regulatory requirements  the level of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturity investments trading and fixed maturity investments available for sale in an unrealized gain position  and other relevant factors 
for the year ended december   we recognized nil of other than temporary impairments due to required sales 
in evaluating credit losses  we consider a variety of factors in the assessment of a security including i the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost  ii the extent of the decline below cost and par  iii the potential for the security to recover in value  iv an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer  v the rating of the issuer  vi the implied rating of the issuer based on an analysis of option adjusted spreads  vii the absolute level of the option adjusted spread for the issuer  and viii an analysis of the collateral structure and credit support of the security  if applicable 
once we determine that it is possible that a credit loss may exist for a security  we perform a detailed review of the cash flows expected to be collected from the issuer 
we estimate expected cash flows by applying estimated default probabilities and recovery rates to the contractual cash flows of the issuer  with such default and recovery rates reflecting long term historical averages adjusted to reflect current credit  economic and market conditions  giving due consideration to collateral and credit support  if applicable  and discounting the expected cash flows at the purchase yield on the security 
in instances in which a determination is made that an impairment exists but we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis  the impairment is separated into i the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss  and ii the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to all other factors 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of credit related other than temporary impairments which were recognized in earnings and million related to other factors which were recognized in other comprehensive income 
at december  and  our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million and nil  respectively 
under the pre existing guidance  which was in effect for  and the three months ended march   the company assessed  on a quarterly basis  whether declines in the fair value of its fixed maturity investments available for sale represented impairments that were other than temporary based on several factors 
the factors the company considered in the assessment of a security included i the time period during which there had been a significant decline below cost  ii the extent of the decline below cost  iii the company s intent and ability to hold the security  iv the potential for the security to recover in value  v an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer  and vi an analysis of the collateral structure and credit support of the security  if applicable 
where the company determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the security  the cost of the security was written down to its fair value and the unrealized loss at the time of determination was reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the majority of the company s fixed maturity investments available for sale are managed by external investment managers in accordance with specific investment mandates and guidelines 
the investment managers are directed to manage the company s investments to maximize total investment return in accordance with these investment mandates and guidelines 
while the company has adequate capital and liquidity to support its operations and to hold its fixed maturity investments available for sale which were in an unrealized loss position until they recover in value  the company has not prohibited or restricted its investment managers from selling these investments and its investment managers actively traded the company s investments 
the company was therefore unable to represent or certify that it had the intent or ability to hold these investments until they recovered in value 
as a consequence  under the pre existing guidance which was in effect for  and the three months ended march   the company impaired essentially all of its fixed maturity investments available for sale that were in an unrealized loss position at each quarterly reporting date 
during the fourth quarter of  we started designating  upon acquisition  certain fixed maturity investments as trading  rather than as available for sale and  as a result  we recognized million of net unrealized losses on these securities in our consolidated statements of operations in we made this change  due in part to the new authoritative other than temporary impairment gaap guidance that became effective in which has resulted in additional accounting judgments required to be made on a quarterly basis  combined with an effort to report our fixed maturity investment portfolio results in our consolidated statements of operation in a manner 
table of contents consistent with the way in which we manage the portfolio  which is on a total investment return basis 
we currently expect to continue to designate  in future periods  upon acquisition  certain fixed maturity investments as trading  rather than as available for sale  and  as a result  we currently expect our fixed maturity investments available for sale balance to decrease and our fixed maturity trading balance to increase over time  resulting in a reduction in other than temporary accounting judgments we make 
this change will over time result in additional volatility in our net income loss in future periods as net unrealized gains and losses on these fixed maturity investments will be recorded currently in net income loss  rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
investments in other ventures  under equity method investments in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in other ventures  under equity method  and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under this method  we record our proportionate share of income or loss from such investments in our results for the period 
any decline in the value of investments in other ventures  under equity method  including goodwill and other intangible assets arising upon acquisition of the investee  considered by management to be other than temporary  is impaired and is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which it is determined 
as of december   we had million million in investments in other ventures  under equity method on our consolidated balance sheets  including million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets million and million 
in determining whether an equity method investment is impaired  we look at a variety of factors including the operating and financial performance of the investee  the investee s future business plans and projections  recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies where available  discussions with the investees management  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers in value 
in doing this  we make assumptions and estimates in assessing whether an impairment has occurred and if  in the future  our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of these investments change  this could result in a material decrease in the carrying value of these investments 
this would cause us to write down the carrying value of these investments and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the impairment charge is taken 
during the year ended december   we recorded nil million  nil in other than temporary impairment charges related to investments in other ventures  under the equity method 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets acquired are initially recorded at fair value 
subsequent to initial recognition  finite lived other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life  subject to impairment  and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
if goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired  they are written down to their estimated fair values with a corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for purposes of the annual impairment evaluation  goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting unit of the acquired entities giving rise to the goodwill and other intangible assets are tested based on the cash flows they produce 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation 
principally  we identify the reporting unit or business entity that the goodwill or other intangible asset is attributed to  and review historical and forecasted operating and financial performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis  including market conditions 
other assumptions used could produce significantly different results which may result in a change in the value of goodwill or our other intangible assets and related charge in our consolidated statements of operations 
an impairment charge could be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the implied fair value of those operations where the goodwill or other intangible assets are applicable 
as at december   excluding the amounts recorded in investments in other ventures  under equity method  as noted above  our consolidated balance sheets include million of goodwill million and million of other intangible assets million 
as part of the annual impairment evaluation noted above  no reporting units were identified to be at risk of failing step one of the process for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other 
impairment charges were nil during nil  nil 

table of contents premiums we recognize premiums as revenue over the terms of the related contracts and policies 
our written premiums are based on policy and contract terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies 
the information received is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications and or discussions with ceding companies or their broker 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of written premium including adjustment and reinstatement premium  earned premium  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
we generally recognize premium on the date the contract is bound  even if the contract provides for an effective date prior to the date the contract is bound  thus preventing premature revenue recognition 
the date the contract is bound is usually the date we are on risk for the policy 
the date we are on risk is generally either the effective date of the contract if the slip is signed prior to the effective date of the contract or the date the reinsurance slip is signed if that occurs after the effective date of the contract 
the signing of the reinsurance contract normally occurs after the date the slip is signed 
we book premiums on non proportional contracts in accordance with the contract terms 
premiums written on losses occurring contracts are typically earned over the contract period 
premiums on risks attaching contracts are either estimated or earned as reported by the cedants  which may be over a period more than twice as long as the contract period 
for multi year policies  only the initial annual premium is included as written at policy inception 
the remaining annual premiums are included as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
management is required to make estimates based on judgment and historical experience for periods during which information has not yet been received 
in our individual risk business  it is often necessary to estimate portions of premiums written from quota share contracts and by third party program managers and the related commission expense 
management estimates these amounts based on discussions with ceding companies and third party program managers  together with historical experience and judgment 
total premiums written estimated in our individual risk business at december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and total estimated premiums earned were million  million and million  respectively 
total earned commissions estimated at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
management tracks the actual premium received and commissions incurred and compares this to the estimates previously booked 
such estimates are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods when actual figures are recorded 
to date  such subsequent adjustments have not been material 
since premiums for our reinsurance segment are contractually driven and the reporting lag for such premiums is minimal  estimates for premiums written for this segment are usually not significant 
the minimum and deposit premiums on excess policies are usually set forth in the language of the contract and are used to record premiums on these policies 
actual premiums are determined in subsequent periods based on actual exposures and any adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
in recent periods  the complexity of estimating reinsurance premiums has been impacted by the financial difficulties being experienced in certain of our target markets  which has contributed to circumstances in which primary insurers have been unable to make  or have sought to defer  premium payments due to us 
we cannot assure you that our estimates of the collectability of premiums are accurate or that these trends will not be accelerated in future periods 
reinstatement premiums are estimated after the occurrence of a significant loss and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses and case reserves 
reinstatement premiums are earned when written 
ceded premiums are also recognized on the date the contract is bound and are deducted from gross premiums written  to arrive at net premiums written 
ceded premiums are earned over the terms of the related contracts and policies  and are reflected as a reduction to gross premiums earned to arrive at net premiums earned 
income taxes income taxes have been provided in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic income taxes  on those operations which are subject to income tax 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
such temporary differences are primarily due to the tax basis discount on unpaid losses and loss expenses  unearned premium reserves  net operating loss carryforwards  intangible assets  accrued expenses  deferred policy acquisition costs and certain investments 
the effect on deferred tax assets and 
table of contents liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   our net deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were million million and million million  respectively see note taxation in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
at each balance sheet date  we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces the net deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future gaap taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 
in  and  we generated cumulative gaap taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries 
during and  our valuation allowance was reassessed and we determined at such time that it was more likely than not that we will continue to generate gaap taxable income in our us tax paying subsidiaries and therefore be able to recover all of our us net deferred tax asset 
as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance for the years ending december  and december  by million and million  respectively 
this resulted in a corresponding increase to net income in and  respectively 
projections of future gaap taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are likely to differ from actual experience 
the company had no unrecognized tax benefits upon adoption of guidance under fasb asc topic income taxes and has no unrecognized tax benefits as of december  tax years through  through and  are open for examination by the internal revenue service  irish tax authorities and uk tax authorities  respectively

net negative impact is based on management s estimates following a review of our potential exposures and discussions with our counterparties 
given the magnitude and relatively recent occurrence of these events  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  actual losses from these events may increase if the company s reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by customers and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
changes to these estimates will be recorded in the periods in which they occur

our underwriting expenses consist of acquisition expenses and operational expenses 
acquisition expenses consist of the costs to acquire premiums and are principally comprised of broker commissions and excise taxes 
acquisition expenses are driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums and  accordingly  these costs will normally move in line with the fluctuation in gross premiums earned

offsetting these decreases in gross premiums written for  was a million  or increase  in our crop insurance gross premiums written  principally driven by an increase in policy count  which more than offset a decline in commodity prices used in determining the policy premium 
gross premiums written for our individual risk segment increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase in gross premiums written for our individual risk segment is primarily due to a million increase in the crop insurance business due principally to higher

with the acquisition of the net assets of agro national  llc in we invested in this line of business and plan to seek to increase our gross premiums written for this business  subject to market conditions 
the premium and underwriting results associated with this business can be volatile  driven principally by changes in commodity prices and weather events in the us which impacts the price and yield of the insured crops and correspondingly also impacts the premium charged for the policies issued and the net claims and claim expenses incurred 
due to the growing proportion of this line of business within our individual risk results  we expect this potential volatility to increase 
the rma has currently proposed several changes to the sra that  if ultimately adopted  would adversely affect the financial results of mpci insurers such as ours  in industry feedback to the draft of the sra has to date not been positive and the rma is expected to circulate further drafts of the agreement before it becomes final

acquisition expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned in were  compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in the acquisition expense ratio in is primarily due to profit sharing commissions due to favorable development increasing our underwriting results on older accident years 
in  certain components of underwriting expenses that were incurred in with respect to the crop insurance business are no longer reflected due to our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of agro national  llc  the agency that produces this business  in the second quarter of operating expenses consist of compensation and other general and administrative expenses 
our individual risk business historically operated with a relatively small number of employees and  accordingly  we have outsourced much of the administration in our individual risk business to third party program managers and third party administrators 
however we continuously monitor and analyze opportunities to internalize such services and in recent years we have increased our headcount and related 
table of contents expenses 
operating expenses in our individual risk segment increased to million in  from million in and million in  principally as a result of the company s investment in personnel and related infrastructure in association with its ongoing business development initiatives 
net investment income year ended december  in thousands fixed maturity investments short term investments other investments hedge funds and private equity investments other cash and cash equivalents investment expenses net investment income net investment income for was million  compared to million in the million increase in net investment income was principally driven by a million increase in net investment income from our hedge funds and private equity investments from negative million in to million in  and a million increase in net investment income from our senior secured bank loan funds and non us fixed income funds within our other investments  from negative million in to million in  and partially offset by a million and million decrease in net investment income from our fixed maturity investments and short term investments  respectively  primarily due to lower yields due to the current lower interest rate environment and lower average invested assets for our short term investments 
our hedge fund  private equity and other investments are accounted for at fair value with the change in fair value recorded in net investment income which included net unrealized gains of million in  compared to million of net unrealized losses in our net investment income for benefitted from the tightening of credit spreads  which resulted in increases in the fair value of many of our investments 
net investment income for was million  compared to million during  a decrease of million  as a result of lower returns in our investment portfolio mainly driven by our other investments 
included in the net investment loss is a million loss from hedge funds and private equity investments in compared to million of net investment income from these funds in  a decrease of million 
also included in net investment loss in is a million loss related primarily to senior secured bank loan funds and non us fixed income funds compared to million of net investment income from these funds in  a decrease of million 
the results from the company s other investments described above include net unrealized losses of million in  compared to net unrealized gains of million in net investment income from fixed maturity investments available for sale increased million to million in  compared to million in as a result of higher returns on these investments due in part to a widening of credit spreads 
net investment income from short term investments decreased million in to million from million in  principally due to a decrease in short term interest rates as well as a decrease in average balances for these investments as a result of our share repurchases during reductions in the federal funds rate by the board of governors of the federal reserve board and corresponding decline in interest rates has lowered the interest rate at which we invest our assets 
we expect these developments  combined with the current composition of our investment portfolio and other factors  to put downward pressure on our net investment income for the foreseeable future 
among other factors  our current asset allocations reflect a relative reduction from earlier periods of the number of classes of securities characterized by higher estimated yields and expected risk  which has reduced the yield to maturity for our investment portfolio and which we expect will also impact future net investment income

a large majority of our investments are invested in the fixed income markets and  therefore  our realized holding gains and losses on investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in interest rates 
therefore  as interest rates decline  we will tend to have realized gains from the turnover of our investment portfolio  and as interest rates rise  we will tend to have realized losses from the turnover of our investment portfolio 
during the fourth quarter of  we started designating  upon acquisition  certain fixed maturity investments as trading  rather than as available for sale and  as a result  we recognized million of net unrealized losses on these securities in our consolidated statements of operations in we made this change  due in part to the new authoritative other than temporary impairment gaap guidance that became effective in which has resulted in additional accounting judgments required to be made on a quarterly basis  combined with an effort to report our fixed maturity investment portfolio results in our consolidated statements of operation in a manner consistent with the way in which we manage the portfolio  which is on a total investment return basis 
we currently expect to continue to designate  in future periods  upon acquisition  certain fixed maturity investments as trading  rather than as available for sale  and  as a result  we currently expect our fixed maturity investments available for sale balance to decrease and our fixed maturity trading balance to increase over time  resulting in a reduction in other than temporary accounting judgments we make 
this change will over time result in additional volatility in our net income loss in future periods as net unrealized gains and losses on these fixed maturity investments will be recorded currently in net income loss  rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
net other than temporary impairments were million in  compared to million in net other than temporary impairments relate to our fixed maturity investments available for sale 
for the years ended december  and and for the first three months of  we recognized other than temporary impairments if we could not assert that we had the ability and intent to hold our securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in accordance with authoritative literature 
if the impairment was determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss was recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
for the years ended december  and and for the first three months of  we recognized other than temporary impairments of million  million and million  respectively 
for the nine months ended december   under updated guidance for the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments which we adopted in the second quarter of  we recorded million of total other than temporary impairments of which million was recognized in earnings and includes million for credit losses and million for investments we intend to sell  with the remaining million related to other factors recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income 
under the guidance adopted in the second quarter of  we now recognize other than temporary impairments in earnings for impaired fixed maturity investments available for sale i for which we have the intent to sell the security or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery and iii for those securities which have a credit loss 
realized investment gains and losses totaled million and million  respectively  during  compared to million and million  respectively  in other than temporary impairment charges related to our fixed maturity investments available for sale totaled million and million in and 
table of contents  respectively 
other than temporary impairments in were driven by the turmoil in the financial markets and widening credit spreads 
during  our million of other than temporary impairment charges was a result of a falling interest rate environment during the year which resulted in lower unrealized losses on our fixed maturity securities  prior to the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses on such securities 
credit related other than temporary impairment charges totaled million and nil for and  respectively 
the credit related other than temporary impairment charges in  which includes impairments for which the company believes it will not be able to recover the full principal amount if held to maturity  were principally driven by our direct holdings of fixed maturity securities issued by lehman brothers

equity in earnings of other ventures generated million in income in  compared to million in the million decrease in equity in earnings of other ventures in compared to is primarily due to starbound ii becoming a consolidated entity effective august   which is included in other in the table above  combined with lower equity in earnings from tower hill and the tower hill companies 
equity in earnings losses of other ventures generated million in income in  compared to a loss of million in the increase is primarily due to the absence of any additional losses related to channelre  since channelre is in a negative shareholders equity position  and consequently  our investment in channelre continued to be carried at nil during and until such time as channelre s shareholders equity is positive  we will not record any equity in earnings in our investment in channelre 
it is possible that in future periods the nonperformance risk or own credit risk portion of channelre s mark to market on its financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap may increase  or that the underlying mark to market on channelre s financial guaranty contracts accounted for as derivatives under gaap may decrease  or both  which could result in channelre returning to a positive equity position  at which time we would then record our share of channelre s net income  subject to impairment  or our share of channelre s net loss 
except for the fourth quarter of reduction to nil of the carrying value of channelre  the equity pick up for our results in respect of channelre is recorded one quarter in arrears 
the equity pick up for our earnings in tower hill and the tower hill companies is recorded one quarter in arrears

year ended december  in thousands equity in earnings of channelre excluding unrealized mark to market losses equity in channelre unrealized mark to market losses total equity in losses of channelre as discussed above  we reduced the carried value of our investment in channelre to nil in and until such time as channelre s shareholders equity is positive  we will not record any equity in earnings in our investment in channelre 
in  our share of channelre s results was impacted by million of negative mark to market losses 
these mark to market losses were primarily driven by a widening of credit spreads and a lack of liquidity in which was primarily driven by issues related to the sub prime market 
we do not currently expect the mark to market losses experienced by channelre in to reverse

the weather and energy risk management operations results include net realized and unrealized gains and losses on agreements with end users and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on hedging and trading activities 
the end user contracts we enter into and our trading activities are based in part on proprietary weather forecasts provided to us by our weather predict subsidiary 
as noted above  the pre tax profits from our weather and energy risk management operations increased to million in from million in and a loss of million in the weather products and trading activities in which we engage are both seasonal and volatile  and there is no assurance that our performance to date will be indicative of future periods 
we are currently in the process of enhancing our weather and energy risk management infrastructure and operations to engage in the physical delivery and settlement of various of our energy products with our customers

the average interest rate on this borrowing from january  through november  was  lower than the coupon rate on the senior notes repaid at maturity in july with the proceeds from our revolving credit facility drawdown at that time 
during  our interest expense decreased million to million  compared to million in primarily as a result of the repayment at maturity of our senior notes  which came due july   combined with the extinguishment of the subordinated obligation to renaissancere capital trust capital trust  as detailed below  which resulted in the company not having any further interest expense under this agreement during offsetting these decreases was an increase in interest expense on our revolving credit facility as we borrowed million under this facility to repay the senior notes  described above 
the average interest rate on this borrowing was  therefore lower than the coupon rate on the senior notes 
preferred share dividends remained relatively constant in  when compared to income tax expense benefit year ended december  in thousands income tax expense benefit we are subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  however  since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal

during and  our valuation allowance was reassessed and we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will continue to generate gaap taxable income in our us tax paying insurance subsidiaries and therefore be able to recover all of our us net deferred tax asset 
as a result  our valuation allowance was reduced by million and million in and  respectively  and there was a corresponding decrease to income tax expense and increase to our net income 
our valuation allowance totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the remaining valuation allowance as of december  relates exclusively to our operations in ireland and the uk our ireland and uk operations have produced gaap taxable losses and we currently do not believe it is more likely than not that we 
table of contents will generate gaap taxable income from our subsidiaries in these operations and therefore do not believe that we will be able to recover our net deferred tax assets from these operations 
we expect our consolidated effective tax rate to increase in the future  as our global operations outside of bermuda expand 
in addition  it is possible that we could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws  regulation  or enforcement  any of which could increase our effective tax rate more rapidly or steeply than we currently anticipate 
net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire year ended december  in thousands net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire in october  we formed davincire and davinci with other equity investors 
the company owns a noncontrolling economic interest in davincire  however  because we control a majority of davincire s outstanding voting rights  the consolidated financial statements of davincire are included in our consolidated financial statements 
redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire represents the portion of davincire s earnings owned by third parties for the years ended december   and in  and  davincire generated net income which resulted in net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest expense davincire 
our economic ownership interest in davincire at december   and was approximately  and  respectively 
in january  davincire redeemed the shares of certain third party davincire shareholders and in a separate transaction  we sold a portion of our shares in davincire to a third party shareholder 
as a result of these transactions  our ownership interest in davincire has increased to 
we expect our ownership in davincire to fluctuate over time 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition renaissancere is a holding company  and we therefore rely on dividends from our subsidiaries and investment income to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to make dividend payments to our preference and renaissancere common shareholders 
the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries is  under certain circumstances  limited under statutory regulations and insurance law  which require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
in addition  bermuda regulations require approval from the bma for any reduction of capital in excess of of statutory capital  as defined in the insurance act 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of our bermuda re insurance subsidiaries was billion billion  and the amount of capital and surplus required to be maintained was million million 
during  renaissance reinsurance  davincire and the operating subsidiaries of renre insurance returned capital to our holding company  which included dividends declared and return of capital  net of capital contributions received  of million  nil and million  respectively  compared with million  million and million  respectively  in our principal us insurance subsidiary  stonington  is also required to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity 
restrictions with respect to dividends are based on state statutes 
in addition  there are restrictions based on risk based capital tests which is the threshold that constitutes the authorized control level 
if stonington s statutory capital and surplus falls below the authorized control level  the texas department of insurance tdi is authorized to take whatever regulatory actions are considered necessary to protect policyholders and creditors 
at december   the estimated consolidated statutory capital and surplus of stonington was million million 
because of an accumulated deficit in earned surplus from prior operations  stonington cannot currently pay an ordinary dividend without tdi approval 
renaissancere ccl and syndicate are subject to regulation by the council of lloyd s 
syndicate is also subject to regulation by the fsa under the fsma 
underwriting capacity of a member of lloyd s must be supported by providing a deposit in the form of cash  securities or letters of credit  which are referred to as funds at lloyd s  in an amount determined by lloyd s in relation to the member s underwriting capacity 
this amount is 
table of contents determined by lloyd s through application of a risk based capital formula 
at december   the company maintained million and million as a funds at lloyd s facility 
in addition  the fsa requires lloyd s syndicates to satisfy an annual solvency test and to maintain solvency on a continuous basis  which syndicate was in compliance with at december  in the aggregate  our operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us 
our subsidiaries also maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities  which management believes will provide additional liquidity for extraordinary claims payments should the need arise 
as of april   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility to meet additional liquidity and capital requirements 
at december   no amounts remained outstanding under this facility 
see capital resources section below 
cash flows and liquidity cash flows provided by operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million  which principally consisted of our net income of  million and an increase in reinsurance balances payable of million  partially offset by a decrease in our reserve for unearned premiums of million  a decrease in claims and claim expenses  net of million  an unrealized gain included in net investment income of million related to our other investments and net realized and unrealized investment gains on fixed maturity investments of million 
as discussed under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  summary of results of operations for  and  we generated strong underwriting results and significantly improved investment results  which contributed to cash flows provided by operating activities 
in addition  as noted above  claims and claim expenses  net decreased million in  compared to  primarily as a result of million of paid claims and claim expenses during  partially offset by incurred claims and claim expenses of million 
our cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to support our investing and financing activities as discussed below 
cash flows used in investing activities 
during  our cash flows used in investing activities in were million  which principally reflects our decision to decrease our allocation to short term investments by billion  and increase our allocation to fixed maturity investments by billion  as a result of the low interest rate environment experienced during in addition  we made several strategic investments during  including the acquisition of spectrum during the fourth quarter of cash flows used in financing activities 
our cash flows used in financing activities in were million  primarily as a result of the repurchase of million of our common shares and the repayment of the million borrowed under our prior revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter of  the repurchase of million of the outstanding shares of davincire from third party shareholders in the first quarter of and the payment of million and million in dividends to our common and preferred shareholders  respectively 
we have generated cash flows from operations over the three year period between and significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
however  because a large portion of the coverages we provide can produce losses of high severity and low frequency  it is not possible to accurately predict our future cash flows from operating activities 
as a consequence  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
due to the magnitude and relatively recent occurrence of hurricanes gustav and ike during the third quarter of  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding losses from these events and our actual ultimate net losses from these events may vary from preliminary estimates  perhaps materially 
as a result  our cash flows from operations would be impacted accordingly 
reserves for claims and claim expenses we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves 
claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell 
we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies  but which have not yet been paid case reserves  adding the costs for additional case reserves additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims previously reported to us which we believe may not be adequately reserved as of that date  and adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 

table of contents the following table summarizes our claims and claim expense reserves by line of business and split between case reserves  additional case reserves and ibnr at december  and at december  case reserves additional case reserves ibnr total in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total at december  in thousands property catastrophe reinsurance specialty reinsurance total reinsurance individual risk total our estimates of claims and claim expense reserves are not precise in that  among other matters  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors 
some  but not all  of our reserves are further subject to the uncertainty inherent in actuarial methodologies and estimates 
because a reserve estimate is simply an insurer s estimate at a point in time of its ultimate liability  and because there are numerous factors which affect reserves and claims payments but cannot be determined with certainty in advance  our ultimate payments will vary  perhaps materially  from our estimates of reserves 
if we determine in a subsequent period that adjustments to our previously established reserves are appropriate  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
during the twelve months ended december   and  changes to prior year estimated claims reserves increased our net income by million  million and million  respectively  excluding the consideration of changes in reinstatement premium  profit commissions  redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire and income tax expense 
our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for the company s ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses 
we do not calculate a range of estimates 
we use this point estimate  along with paid claims and case reserves  to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our consolidated financial statements 
under gaap  we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss 
reserving for our reinsurance claims involves other uncertainties  such as the dependence on information from ceding companies  which among other matters  includes the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux  broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers 
this information can be received on a monthly  quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes estimates of paid claims and case reserves 
we sometimes also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr 
this information is often updated and adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims  client accounts  industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws 
we recorded million of gross claims and claim expenses incurred in as a result of losses arising from hurricanes gustav and ike which struck the us in the third quarter of our estimates of losses from hurricanes gustav and ike are based on factors including currently available information derived from the company s preliminary claims information from certain customers and brokers  industry assessments of losses from the events  proprietary models  and the terms and conditions of our contracts 
given the magnitude and 
table of contents relatively recent occurrence of these events  as well as the large storms of  including hurricane katrina  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and  accordingly  several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in addition  our actual net losses from these events may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations 
our actual losses from these events will likely vary  perhaps materially  from these current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving for such losses  including the preliminary nature of the available information  the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by customers and brokers  the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques  the effects of any demand surge on claims activity and complex coverage and other legal issues 
because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above  we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates  and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years 
however  there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods 
our reserving techniques  assumptions and processes differ between our reinsurance and individual risk segments  as well as between our property catastrophe reinsurance and specialty reinsurance businesses within our reinsurance segment 
refer to our claims and claim expense reserves critical accounting estimates discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure  the reserving techniques  assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves  and our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves  for each of these units

preference shares in december  we raised million through the issuance of million series d preference shares  in march  we raised million through the issuance of million series c preference shares  and in february  we raised million through the issuance of million series b preference shares 
the series d  series c and series b preference shares may be redeemed at per share at our option on or after december   march  and february   respectively

the preference shares have no stated maturity and are not convertible into any other of our securities 
senior notes in january  we issued million of senior notes due february   with interest on the notes payable on february and august of each year 
the notes can be redeemed by us prior to maturity subject to payment of a make whole premium 
the notes  which are senior obligations  contain various covenants  including limitations on mergers and consolidations  restrictions as to the disposition of the stock of designated subsidiaries and limitations on liens of the stock of designated subsidiaries  which the company was in compliance with as of february  renaissancere revolving credit facility credit agreement effective april   we amended and restated our credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving commitment of million 
as part of the million commitment  letters of credit may be issued for the account of the company s subsidiaries in an aggregate amount up to million  of which up to million may be used for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the company s non insurance subsidiaries 
on november   the company repaid million previously borrowed under the credit agreement 
the company has the right  subject to satisfying certain conditions  to increase the size of the facility up to million  until the expiration of the current term 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate selected by the company equal to the base rate or libor plus a margin  all as more fully set forth in the credit agreement 
the scheduled commitment termination date under the credit agreement is march  the credit agreement contains representations  warranties and covenants we believe to be customary for bank loan facilities of this type  including customary covenants limiting the company s ability to merge  consolidate  enter into negative pledge agreements  sell a substantial amount of assets  incur liens and declare or pay dividends under certain circumstances 
the credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants we believe to be customary for reinsurance and insurance companies in revolving credit facilities of this type  which generally provide that the company s consolidated debt to capital shall not exceed the ratio of and that the consolidated net worth the net worth requirements of the company and renaissance reinsurance shall equal or exceed billion and million  respectively  subject to a grace period in the case of the net worth requirements which is conditioned on  among other things  renaissance reinsurance maintaining a certain financial strength rating  all as more fully set forth in the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement as of february  we are currently engaged in discussions with our lenders to renew the credit agreement  although it is possible that such renewal  if any  may be on terms that are less favorable to us than those contained in the existing credit agreement  particularly in light of the ongoing disruptions  uncertainty and volatility in the capital and credit markets  during which access to capital on attractive terms has been challenging for many companies 
our ability to renew the credit agreement  and the terms of such renewal  if any  will depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time  including our financial position  operating results and credit and capital market conditions 
in the event that we are unable to renew the credit agreement at a reasonable price and otherwise on terms satisfactory to us or at all  or if we decide not to renew the credit agreement in whole or in part  we may pursue alternative financing arrangements in order to meet our ongoing liquidity needs 
davincire revolving credit facility davincire is a party to a third amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of april  the davincire credit agreement  which provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to million that matures on april  the term of the davincire credit agreement may be extended and the commitment amount may be increased to million  provided certain conditions are met 
interest rates are based on a spread above libor  and averaged approximately during 
the davincire credit agreement requires davincire and davinci to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
table of contents and million  respectively  and requires davincire to maintain a debt to capital ratio of no greater than 
davincire was in compliance with the financial covenants as of february  at december   million remained outstanding 
neither renaissancere nor renaissance reinsurance is a guarantor of this facility and the lenders have no recourse against us or our subsidiaries other than davincire and davinci under the davincire credit agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  a default by davincire on its obligations under the davincire credit agreement will not result in a default under the credit agreement 
renaissance trading margin facility and guarantees renaissance trading maintains a brokerage facility with a leading prime broker  which has an associated margin facility 
this margin facility  which we believe allows renaissance trading to prudently manage its cash position related to its exchange traded products  is supported by a million guarantee issued by renaissancere 
interest on amounts outstanding under this facility is at overnight libor plus basis points 
at december   nil was outstanding under the facility 
from time to time  the company provides guarantees to support the weather and energy risk management operations of renaissance trading 
as of december   there were approximately million of such guarantees outstanding 
we expect the amount of these guarantees to fluctuate over time 
letter of credit facilities under the terms of certain reinsurance contracts  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and joint ventures may be required to provide letters of credit to reinsureds in respect of reported claims and or unearned premiums 
our principal letter of credit facility is evidenced by a second amended and restated reimbursement agreement  dated as of april  the principal facility  and is a syndicated secured facility which matures on april  the principal facility evidences a commitment from the lenders thereunder in an aggregate amount of billion  which may be increased up to an amount not to exceed billion provided certain conditions are met 
the principal facility contains representations  warranties and covenants we believe to be customary for facilities of this type  including customary covenants limiting the ability to merge  consolidate  sell a substantial amount of assets  incur indebtedness and declare or pay dividends 
the principal facility also contains certain financial covenants we believe to be customary for reinsurance and insurance companies in facilities of this type  which require the company and davinci to maintain a minimum net worth of million and million  respectively 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of february  under the principal facility  our participating operating subsidiaries and our managed joint ventures have pledged and must maintain as pledged as collateral shares issued to them by our subsidiary  renaissance investment holdings ltd 
rihl  with a sufficient collateral value to support their respective obligations under the principal facility  including reimbursement obligations for outstanding letters of credit 
in addition  for liquidity purposes  in order to be permitted to pledge rihl shares as collateral  each participating subsidiary and joint venture must maintain additional unpledged rihl shares that have a net asset value at least equal to of its facility usage  and rihl shares having an aggregate net asset value equal to at least of the net asset value of all outstanding rihl shares must remain unencumbered 
the participating subsidiaries and joint ventures have the option to post alternative forms of collateral 
in the case of a default under the principal facility  or in other circumstances in which the rights of the lenders thereunder to collect on their collateral may be impaired  the lenders may exercise certain remedies  including redemption of pledged shares and conversion of the collateral into cash or eligible marketable securities 
the redemption of shares by the collateral agent takes priority over any pending redemption of unpledged shares by us or other holders 
we are currently engaged in discussions with our lenders to renew the principal facility  although it is possible that such renewal  if any  may be on terms that are less favorable to us than those contained in the existing principal facility  particularly in light of the ongoing disruptions  uncertainty and volatility in the capital and credit markets  during which access to capital on attractive terms has been challenging for many companies 
our ability to renew the principal facility  and the terms of such renewal  if any  will depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time  including our financial position  operating results and credit and capital market conditions 
in the event that we are unable to renew the principal facility at a reasonable price and otherwise on terms satisfactory to us or at all  we may have to seek alternative means of supporting the operations of our bermuda based entities  which could include utilizing holding company funds 
these alternatives  if required  could increase our operating expenses on an absolute and relative basis compared to past periods 

table of contents on april   renaissance reinsurance entered into a master reimbursement agreement the reimbursement agreement and a pledge agreement the pledge agreement with citibank europe plc cep 
the reimbursement agreement provides for the issuance and renewal of letters of credit by cep from time to time in its sole discretion  which are used to support business written by syndicate at december   two letters of credit issued by cep under the reimbursement agreement were outstanding  in the amount of million and million  respectively  each having an expiration date of december  pursuant to the pledge agreement  renaissance reinsurance has agreed to pledge to cep and maintain certain securities with a collateral value equal to of the aggregate amount of the then outstanding letters of credit 
in respect of the unsecured portion  renaissance reinsurance is required to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining a certain minimum financial strength rating  minimum net worth  and a maximum consolidated debt to capital ratio for the consolidated group 
in the event renaissance reinsurance is unable to satisfy any of these financial covenants  it will be required to pledge additional collateral in respect of the unsecured portion 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of february  in addition  our subsidiary  stonington  is a party to a collateralized letter of credit and reimbursement agreement  pursuant to which letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million have been issued for the benefit of two counterparties 
stonington s obligations under this facility are secured by cash and eligible marketable securities 
renaissance reinsurance is also party to a collateralized letter of credit and reimbursement agreement in the amount of million that supports our top layer re joint venture 
renaissance reinsurance is obligated to make a mandatory capital contribution of up to million in the event that a loss reduces top layer re s capital below a specified level 
at february   we had million of letters of credit with effective dates on or before december  outstanding under the principal facility and total letters of credit outstanding under all facilities of million 
redeemable noncontrolling interest davincire davincire shareholders are party to a shareholders agreement the shareholders agreement which provides davincire shareholders  excluding us  with certain redemption rights  that enable each shareholder to notify davincire of such shareholder s desire for davincire to repurchase up to half of such shareholder s aggregate number of shares held  subject to certain limitations  such as limiting the aggregate of all share repurchase requests to of davincire s capital in any given year and satisfying all applicable regulatory requirements 
if total shareholder requests exceed of davincire s capital  the number of shares repurchased will be reduced among the requesting shareholders pro rata  based on the amounts desired to be repurchased 
shareholders desiring to have davincire repurchase their shares must notify davincire before march of each year 
the repurchase price will be based on gaap book value as of the end of the year in which the shareholder notice is given  and the repurchase will be effective as of such date 
payment will be made by april of the following year  following delivery of the audited financial statements for the year in which the repurchase was effective

certain third party shareholders of davincire submitted repurchase notices on or before the required annual redemption notice date of march   in accordance with the shareholders agreement 
the repurchase notices submitted on or before march   were for shares of davincire with a gaap book value of million at december  effective january   davincire redeemed the shares for million  less a million reserve holdback  and  in a separate transaction  we sold a portion of our shares in davincire to a third party shareholder 
as a result of these transactions  our ownership interest in davincire increased to 
we expect our ownership in davincire to fluctuate over time 
credit ratings our ratings continue to be among the highest in our industry and continue to be supported by our strong financial position 
our credit ratings are also supported by our prudent erm practices which are rated excellent by s p

at the same time  s p raised its ccr and fsr on renaissance reinsurance to aa from a 
in addition  s p raised its ccr on davinci to a from a 
the outlook is stable for these ratings 
although the ratings of renaissance reinsurance are among the highest in our business  adverse ratings actions could have a negative effect on our ability to fully realize current or future market opportunities 
moreover  if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best  s p  moody s or fitch  we believe our competitive position in the insurance industry would suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business move to other reinsurers with higher ratings 
we cannot give any assurance regarding whether or to what extent the rating agencies may downgrade our ratings 
in addition  it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain provisions permitting our customers to cancel coverage pro rata if our relevant operating subsidiary is downgraded below a certain rating level 
whether a client would exercise this right would depend  among other factors  on the reason for such a downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
therefore  in the event of a downgrade  it is not possible to predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised  if at all  or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect potentially could be material 
to date  we are not aware that we have experienced such a cancellation 
shareholders equity our shareholders equity increased million to billion at december  from billion at december  the significant components of the increase in shareholders equity includes our comprehensive income attributable to renaissancere of million  partially offset by million of dividends paid to renaissancere common shareholders and million of common share repurchases made during investments the table below shows the aggregate amounts of our invested assets at december  and at december  in thousands  except percentages us treasuries agencies non us government sovereign debt fdic guaranteed corporate non us government backed corporate corporate agency mortgage backed securities non agency mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities asset backed securities total fixed maturity investments  at fair value short term investments  at fair value other investments  at fair value total managed investment portfolio investments in other ventures  under equity method total investments included in fixed maturity investments  at fair value at december  and are million and nil  respectively  of fixed maturity investments designated as trading under asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 

table of contents at december   we held investments totaling billion  compared to billion at december   with net unrealized appreciation included in accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december   compared to million at december  our investment guidelines stress preservation of capital  market liquidity  and diversification of risk 
notwithstanding the foregoing  our investments are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
the large majority of our investments consist of highly rated fixed income securities 
we also have an allocation to other investments  including hedge funds  private equity partnerships  senior secured bank loan funds and other investments

in addition  within our other investments category we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities and non investment grade cat linked securities 
at december   the funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities and non investment grade cat linked securities totaled million million 
as of december   we had  million of short term investments  million 
short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased 
short term investments are carried at fair value 
during  we decreased our allocation to short term investments by billion  and increased our allocation to fixed maturity investments by billion 
our target benchmark portfolio for our fixed maturity investments and short term investments currently has a year duration 
our duration at december  was years years  reflecting our view that the current level of rates affords inadequate compensation for the assumption of additional interest rate risk associated with longer duration 
from time to time  we may reevaluate the duration of our portfolio in light of the duration of our liabilities and market conditions 
as with other fixed income investments  the value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in the overall investment market and in overall economic conditions 
additionally  our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our investments 
examples of some of these risks include changes in the overall interest rate environment can expose us to prepayment risk on our mortgage backed investments 
when interest rates decline  consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us more quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
when we receive these prepayments  our opportunities to reinvest these proceeds back into the investment markets will likely be at reduced interest rates 
conversely  when interest rates increase  consumers will generally make fewer prepayments on their mortgages and  as a result  our investments in mortgage backed securities will be repaid to us less quickly than we might have originally anticipated 
this will increase the duration of our portfolio  which is disadvantageous to us in a rising interest rate environment 
our investments in mortgage backed securities are also subject to default risk 
this risk is due in part to defaults on the underlying securitized mortgages  which would decrease the market value of the investment and be disadvantageous to us 
our investments in debt securities of other corporations are exposed to losses from insolvencies of these corporations  and our investment portfolio can also deteriorate based on reduced credit quality of these corporations 
we are also exposed to widening credit spreads even if specific securities are not downgraded 
our investments in asset backed securities are subject to prepayment risks  as noted above  and to the structural risks of these securities 
the structural risks primarily emanate from the priority of each security in the issuer s overall capital structure 
we are also exposed to widening credit spreads 

table of contents within our other investments category  we have several funds that invest in non investment grade fixed income securities as well as securities denominated in foreign currencies 
these investments expose us to losses from insolvencies and other credit related issues 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may result in realized losses to us if our exposures are not hedged or if our hedging strategies are not effective and also to widening of credit spreads

realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are determined on the basis of the first in first out cost method and include adjustments to the cost basis of investments for declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
pursuant to authoritative guidance effective april   we revised our quarterly process for assessing whether declines in the fair value of our fixed maturity investments available for sale represent impairments that are other than temporary 
the process now includes reviewing each fixed maturity investment available for sale that is impaired and determining i if we have the intent to sell the debt security or ii if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  and iii assessing whether a credit loss exists  that is  where we expect that the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security are less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
see note investments in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding other than temporary impairments

the significant decrease in net other than temporary impairments is due to a combination of improved economic conditions during  compared to  and the adoption of new authoritative accounting guidance related to the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments adopted during the second quarter of the net other than temporary impairment charges in and were primarily due to widening credit spreads during the early part of and throughout as a result of the turmoil in the financial and capital markets and the net other than temporary impairment charges in were principally due to rising interest rates

table of contents the fair value of certain of our fund investments  which principally include hedge funds  private equity partnerships  senior secured bank loan funds and non us fixed income funds  is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments  if applicable 
these net asset valuations are determined based upon the valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments 
such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had ready markets existed for the shares  partnership interests or notes 
many of our fund investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
in addition  due to a lag in reporting  some of our fund managers  fund administrators  or both  are unable to provide final fund valuations as of our current reporting date 
in these circumstances  we estimate the fair value of these funds by starting with the prior month s or quarter s fund valuation  adjusting these valuations for capital calls  redemptions or distributions and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and then estimating the return for the current period 
in circumstances in which we estimate the return for the current period  we use all credible information available to us 
this principally includes preliminary estimates reported to us by our fund managers  obtaining the valuation of underlying portfolio investments where such underlying investments are publicly traded and therefore have a readily observable price  using information that is available to us with respect to the underlying investments  reviewing various indices for similar investments or asset classes  as well as estimating returns based on the results of similar types of investments for which we have reported results  or other valuation methods  as necessary 
actual final fund valuations may differ from our estimates and these differences are recorded in the period they become known as a change in estimate 
our estimate of the fair value of catastrophe bonds are based on quoted market prices  or when such prices are not available  by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications

the fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investments 
we generally have no right to redeem our interest in any of these private equity partnerships in advance of dissolution of the applicable partnership 
instead  the nature of these investments is that distributions are received by us in connection with the liquidation of the underlying assets of the applicable limited partnership 
if these investments were held  it is estimated that the majority of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships would liquidate over to years 
senior secured bank loan funds our investment in senior secured bank loan funds includes funds that invest primarily in bank loans and other senior debt instruments 
the fair values of the investments in this category have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the funds

if these investments were held  it is estimated that the majority of the underlying assets of the funds would liquidate over to years 
it is our understanding that the management of the senior secured bank loan funds which currently cannot generally be redeemed is planning to restructure these investments during  in such a way that we may have the option to transfer our investment to a fund structure which we would liquidate in the near term  although we cannot assure you this restructuring will be consummated

effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy

in addition  as summarized in current outlook below  it is possible that the risk of general economic inflation has increased which could  among other things  cause claims and claim expenses to increase and also impact the performance of our investment portfolio

the interest on this facility is based on a spread above libor 
we have reflected the interest due in and based upon the current interest rate on the facility 
the private equity and investment commitments do not have a defined contractual commitment date and we have therefore included them in the less than one year category 
we caution the reader that the information provided above related to estimated future payment dates of our reserves for claims and claim expenses is not prepared or utilized for internal purposes and that we currently do not estimate the future payment dates of claims and claim expenses 
because of the nature of the coverages that we provide  the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our policy liabilities will fluctuate  perhaps significantly  and therefore are highly uncertain 
we have based our estimates of future claim payments upon benchmark industry payment patterns  drawing upon available relevant sources of loss and allocated loss adjustment expense development data 
these benchmarks are revised periodically as new trends emerge 
we believe that it is likely that this benchmark data will not be predictive of our future claim payments and that material fluctuations can occur due to the nature of the losses which we insure and the coverages which we provide 
in certain circumstances  many of our contractual obligations may be accelerated to dates other than those reflected in the table  due to defaults under the agreements governing those obligations including pursuant to cross default provisions in such agreements or in connection with certain changes in control of the company  if applicable 
in addition  in connection with any such default under the agreement governing these obligations  in certain circumstances  these obligations may bear an increased interest rate or be subject to penalties as a result of such a default 
current outlook general economic conditions while there have been some indicators of stabilization  the us and numerous other leading markets around the world continue to experience significant recessionary conditions 
it is not clear that sustained economic recovery in the principal markets we serve is imminent  or that the pace of recovery  if any  would be rapid 
accordingly  we believe meaningful risk remains for continued uncertainty or disruptions in general economic conditions  including additional dislocations in the financial markets or asset classes or of a double dip recession in the us or other key markets 
in  many governments  including the us federal government  took substantial steps to stabilize economic conditions  in an effort to increase liquidity and capital availability  these efforts contributed to significant changes in the financial markets in  resulting in rapid recoveries of asset valuations across many sectors  and increased access to private and public sources of capital 
however  if these stabilizing efforts were to cease prematurely  or if economic conditions otherwise cease to stabilize and again commence to deteriorate further  the business environment in our principal markets would be further adversely affected  which accordingly could adversely affect demand for the products sold by us or our customers 
in addition  during a period of continued economic downturn like the current one  we believe our consolidated 
table of contents credit risk  reflecting our counterparty dealings with customers  agents  brokers  retrocessionaires  capital providers and parties associated with our investment portfolio  among others  is likely to be increased 
moreover  we continue to monitor the risk that our principal markets will experience increased inflationary conditions  which would  among other things  cause costs related to our claims and claim expenses to increase  and impact the performance of our investment portfolio 
the onset  duration and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision 
we currently expect that will be characterized by meaningful returns of capital  both by us and by participants in our industry more generally 
however  our operations are subject to the ever present potential for significant volatility in capital due primarily to our exposure to potentially significant catastrophic events  if the current financial market disruptions should continue or worsen  it could prove difficult to raise capital  if needed  on attractive terms or at all  which would have a material negative impact on our operations 
in addition  our revolving credit facility and our principal existing letter of credit facility are scheduled to expire on march   and april  respectively

ongoing conditions in the investment markets  the interest rate environment and general economic conditions could adversely affect our net investment income on our fixed income investments and our other invested assets 
in  our investment results benefited substantially from factors including spreads tightening and improving valuations at levels which we would not anticipate repeating in future periods 
in addition to impacting our reported net income  potential future losses on our investment portfolio  including potential future mark to market results  would adversely impact our equity capital 
we expect the current volatile financial markets and challenging economic conditions to persist for some time and we are unable to predict with certainty when conditions might improve  or the pace or scale of any such improvement 
market conditions and competition in  us coastal regions exposed to severe hurricane risk benefited from an unusually inactive year meteorologically in the atlantic basin  which is often attributed to the el nino effect 
as a result  insured industry losses for were relatively benign  particularly in the eastern and southeastern us this is in contrast to  and  for example  in which hurricanes katrina  wilma and ike  among others  resulted in substantial insured property losses 
in addition  the dislocations in the investment markets in eroded the capital and surplus of many market participants 
the combination of the storms and the effects of the financial crisis resulted in relatively attractive market conditions at the january and june  catastrophe renewals 
the january  renewal season was characterized by overall stability  and also by a relative shift toward ample supply of capital  impacted by the recovery in the financial markets  asset valuations and the perception of liquidity  decreasing demand  impacted by the same factors  as well as by exposure reduction 
in addition  the competitive conditions in the markets we serve are believed to have been meaningfully impacted in by the us federal government s financing and backstopping of certain large market participants  which are deemed by many market observers and participants to have contributed to inadequate pricing conditions in respect of certain lines and coverages 
absent significant new loss events or the occurrence of other contingencies  we currently expect to see increasingly competitive market conditions for our products throughout  particularly in lines of insurance and reinsurance lacking significant catastrophe exposure 
the benign insured catastrophe loss activity in combined with improvement in the capital markets is likely to have a positive impact on the financial situation and capacity of our customers and our competitors  and is likely to result in increasingly competitive market conditions for our products throughout among other things  increased capital levels and appetite for risk among primary insurance companies may continue to lead to increased retentions  impacting the reinsurance marketplace 
despite these possibilities  we believe that our strong relationships  and track record of superior claims paying ability and other client service  will enable us to compete for the business we find attractive 
however  it is possible that industry pricing in our core product lines will decrease more rapidly than we anticipate  or that we will encounter more significant competitive barriers than we have in the past 
the market for our catastrophe reinsurance products is generally dynamic and volatile 
the market dynamics noted above  increased or decreased catastrophe loss activity  and changes in the amount of capital in the industry can result in significant changes to the pricing  policy terms and demand for our catastrophe reinsurance products over a relatively short period of time 
in addition  changes in state sponsored catastrophe funds  or residual markets  which have generally grown dramatically in recent years  or the implementation of new government subsidized or sponsored programs  can dramatically alter market conditions 
we believe that the overall trend of increased frequency and severity of catastrophic gulf and atlantic coast storms experienced in recent years may continue for the foreseeable future 
increased understanding of the potential increase in 
table of contents frequency and severity of storms may contribute to increased demand for protection in respect of coastal risks which could impact pricing and terms and conditions in coastal areas over time 
we do not believe that the level of weather related losses incurred in is indicative of the likely level of such losses in future periods 
overall  we expect higher property loss cost trends  driven by increased severity and by the potential for increased frequency  to continue over time in the future 
at the same time  certain markets we target are currently being impacted by fundamental weakness experienced by primary insurers  due to the ongoing economic dislocation and  in many cases  inadequate primary insurance rate levels 
these conditions  which occurred in a period characterized by unusually low insured catastrophic losses  contributed to certain publicly announced instances of insolvency  regulatory supervision and other regulatory actions  and have weakened the ability of certain carriers to invest in reinsurance and other protections for coming periods  and in some cases to meet their existing premium obligations 
it is possible that these dynamics will accelerate in the first half of  and potentially lead to unstable and volatile markets in certain regions and sectors 
with respect to our individual risk segment  certain competitors retained more programs in than we had originally expected and did so at economic terms and conditions that we did not find attractive 
moreover  as noted above  market conditions in certain of the sectors in which we focus were adversely impacted by the expansive government financing of certain market participants  which may have contributed to inadequate pricing levels for a number of lines and coverages in we sought to maintain our disciplined underwriting and while we continued to see a substantial number of market opportunities  we did not write as many policies as we had anticipated going into the renewal season 
market conditions are fluid and evolving and we cannot assure you that pricing conditions in these markets will improve or that we will succeed in growing our business if they do 
while we did increase our policy count and aggregate of insured acres relating to our crop insurance business in compared to  premiums in this line of business are inherently volatile as they are driven in part by commodity prices  which are subject to significant short and long term price changes 
we currently expect market conditions in these lines of primary insurance to remain very competitive throughout  particularly for new business 
moreover  the dynamics which could contribute to a potential improvement in rates during in some product lines may well be largely offset by a decline in exposures arising from the ongoing recessionary conditions in our key markets 
we plan to continue our disciplined underwriting approach with respect to both the products which we underwrite and the programs as to which we form partnerships 
while we continuously and actively consider new or expanded relationships and seek to respond quickly to potential new business opportunities  our in depth due diligence process means that executing on potential new opportunities within this segment take time 
we believe that we have established ourselves as an effective and creative  though disciplined  partner for program business opportunities for which to compete 
in addition  we continue to explore potential strategic investments and other opportunities from time to time that are presented to us or that we originate 
in evaluating these potential investments and opportunities  we seek an attractive return on equity  the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage  and opportunities that will not detract from our core operations 
we currently expect the competitive conditions in our core businesses  and the ongoing dislocation in the capital and credit markets  to present additional  potentially attractive growth  investment and operational opportunities  particularly given our strong reputation  financial resources  and track record 
legislative and regulatory update as previously disclosed  in the us house of representatives passed legislation which would expand the national flood insurance program the nfip to cover damage to or loss of real or related personal property located in the us arising from any windstorm any hurricane  tornado  cyclone  typhoon  or other wind event 
in addition  in  the house passed legislation together with the nfip  the house bills  which would create a national catastrophe risk consortium and would also require the us treasury department to establish a national homeowner s insurance stabilization program 
the national catastrophe risk consortium program would allow multiple participating states to pool their respective catastrophic risk insurance or reinsurance wind pools or other residual markets among each other 
the stabilization program would allow the treasury department to make below cost loans to participating states or their reinsurance pools and or residual markets 
in  congress passed a series of short term extensions of the nfip  the latest of which expires again in february the house of representatives and the federal emergency management agency are also 
table of contents exploring the possibility of new legislation which might reshape the federal flood insurance program  perhaps substantially 
at this juncture it is not possible to predict whether the program will indeed be amended  and  if so  whether any such changes would impact us 
a failure to renew the nfip program  particularly if unanticipated by industry participants  could have dislocating impacts on the industry and our customers and potentially have an adverse impact on us 
while the senate has not yet enacted any of the legislation reflected in the house bills and has passed a competing version of the nfip renewal bill which would not add wind to the program  the respective sponsors of the house bills have indicated plans to reintroduce versions of this legislation in the house and senate in in  the coga was introduced in the senate and house which would provide for the federal guarantee of bond issuances by certain government entities  potentially including the fhcf  the texas windstorm insurance association  the california earthquake authority  and others 
if enacted  either of these bills  or legislation similar to these proposals  would  we believe  likely contribute to the growth of these state entities or to their inception or alteration in a manner adverse to us 
while none of this legislation has been enacted to date  and although we believe such legislation would be vigorously opposed if introduced in  if enacted these bills would likely further erode the role of private market catastrophe reinsurers and could adversely impact our financial results  perhaps materially 
in  congress conducted hearings relating to the tax treatment of offshore insurance and is reported to be considering legislation that would adversely affect reinsurance between affiliates and offshore insurance and reinsurance more generally 
in july  us rep 
richard neal introduced one such proposal  hr the neal bill  which provides that foreign insurers and reinsurers would be capped in deducting reinsurance premiums ceded from us units to offshore affiliates 
the neal bill  which was referred to the house ways and means committee  would limit deductions for related party reinsurance cessions to the average percentage of premium ceded to unrelated reinsurers determined in reference to individual business lines 
in the first quarter of  the current administration released its initial budget  which included a proposal to raise revenue by enacting increased taxation on international reinsurance via means which appeared to have similarities with the neal bill 
we can provide no assurance that this legislation or similar legislation will not be adopted 
we believe that passage of such legislation would adversely affect us  perhaps materially 
in march  us senator carl levin and rep 
lloyd doggett introduced legislation in the us senate and house  respectively  entitled the stop tax haven abuse act s 

if enacted  this legislation would  among other things  cause to be treated as a us corporation for us tax purposes generally  entities whose shares are publicly traded on an established securities market  or whose gross assets are million or more  if the management and control of such a corporation is  directly or indirectly  treated as occurring primarily within the us the proposed legislation provides that a corporation will be so treated if substantially all of the executive officers and senior management of the corporation who exercise day to day responsibility for making decisions involving strategic  financial  and operational policies of the corporation are located primarily within the us in addition  among other things  the legislation would establish presumptions for entities and transactions in jurisdictions deemed to be offshore secrecy jurisdictions and would provide a list of such jurisdictions 
to date  this legislation has not been approved by either the house of representatives or the senate 
however  we can provide no assurance that this legislation or similar legislation will not ultimately be adopted 
while we do not believe that the legislation would impact us  it is possible that an adopted bill would include additional or expanded provisions which could negatively impact us  or that the interpretation or enforcement of the current proposal  if enacted  would be more expansive or adverse than we currently estimate 
the rma has currently proposed several changes to the sra  which governs substantial elements of the federal mpci program in which we participate 
the proposal would  if ultimately adopted  have the effect of dramatically reducing the administrative and operating support provided to participating insurers in the program 
other changes reflected in the proposal would have additional adverse impacts on crop insurers  including us 
if the rma proposals are adopted in a revised sra  we would expect our crop insurance business to be adversely impacted  although at this time we cannot precisely quantify the degree of such impact  if any 
we cannot assure you that efforts to amend or ameliorate the rma s proposal will succeed 
the us congress and the current administration have made  or called for consideration of  several additional proposals relating to a variety of issues  with respect to  universal healthcare  financial regulation reform  including regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  the establishment of a single state system of 
table of contents licensure for us and foreign reinsurers  executive compensation and others 
we continue to carefully monitor relevant proposals and believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on the company ranging from minimal to material 
at this time  we are unable to predict with certainty which  if any  proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are principally exposed to five types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk  credit risk  and energy and weather related risk 
the company s investment guidelines permit  subject to approval  investments in derivative instruments such as futures  options  forward contracts and swap agreements  which may be used to assume risks or for hedging purposes 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity investments and short term investments  whose fair values will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity in our fixed maturity investments portfolio to fund operations  pay reinsurance and insurance liabilities and claims and provide funding for unexpected events 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in part by monitoring the duration and structure of our investment portfolio 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of  which equated to a decrease in market value of approximately million on a portfolio valued at billion at december  the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
we use interest rate futures within our portfolio of fixed maturity investments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  which can include increasing or decreasing our exposure to this risk 
at december   we had million of notional long positions and million of notional short positions of eurodollar and non us dollar futures contracts 
we account for these futures contracts at fair value and record them in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of these derivatives as recognized in other assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december   was million million and million million  respectively 
during  we recorded gains of million gains of million  losses of million in our consolidated statement of operations related to these derivatives 
the fair value of these derivatives is determined using exchange traded closing prices 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of our net position in these derivatives of approximately million at december  the foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon  since this presents the worst case scenario 
credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we write a portion of our business in currencies other than us dollars and may  from time to time  experience foreign exchange gains and losses  other income loss and incur underwriting income losses in currencies other than us dollars  which will in turn affect our consolidated financial statements 
all changes in exchange rates  with the exception of non us dollar denominated investments classified as available for sale  are recognized currently in our consolidated statements of operations 
underwriting operations related foreign currency contracts our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to hold foreign currency assets  including cash  investments and receivables that approximate the foreign currency liabilities  including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable 
from time to time  the company may use foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with our underwriting operations 
at december   the total notional exposure in us dollars of our underwriting related foreign currency contracts was million million 
our foreign currency and option contracts are recorded at fair value  which is determined principally by obtaining quotes from independent dealers and counterparties 
during  we incurred a loss of million million  generated a gain of million  on our foreign currency forward and option contracts related to our underwriting operations 

table of contents investment portfolio related foreign currency forward contracts for our investment operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations through our investments in non us dollar fixed maturity investments  short term investments and other investments 
at december   our combined investment in these non us dollar investments was million million 
to economically hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations from these investments  we have from time to time entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising from non us dollar investments classified as available for sale are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar fixed maturity investments available for sale  realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non us dollar fixed maturity investments trading and other investments  and foreign exchange gains losses associated with our hedging of these non us dollar investments are recorded in net foreign exchange gains losses in our statements of operations 
at december   the company had outstanding investment portfolio related foreign currency contracts of million in short positions and million in long positions  denominated in us dollars 
during  we recorded a loss of million gain of million  loss of million on our foreign currency forward contracts related to hedging our non us dollar investments 
this was offset by a gain of million loss of million on our non us dollar denominated investments 
in addition  we recorded a gain of million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million related to the change in unrealized foreign exchange gains losses on non us dollar investments which are classified as available for sale 
in the future  we may choose to increase our exposure to non us dollar investments 
energy and risk management operations related foreign currency contracts the company s energy and risk management operations are exposed to currency fluctuations through certain derivative transactions it enters into that are denominated in non us dollars 
the company may  from time to time  use foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations 
at december   the total notional amount in us dollars of the company s energy and risk management operations related foreign currency contracts was million 
for the year ended december   the company incurred losses of million generated income of million  nil on its foreign currency forward and option contracts related to its energy and risk management operations 
credit risk our exposure to credit risk is primarily due to our fixed maturity investments  short term investments  premiums receivable and ceded reinsurance balances 
at december  and  our invested asset portfolio had a dollar weighted average rating of aa 
from time to time  we purchase credit derivatives to hedge our exposures in the insurance industry  to assist in managing the credit risk associated with ceded reinsurance  or to assume credit risk 
we account for credit derivatives at fair value and record them on our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of the credit derivatives are determined using industry valuation models 
the fair value of these credit derivatives can change based on a variety of factors including changes in credit spreads  default rates and recovery rates  the correlation of credit risk between the referenced credit and the counterparty  and market rate inputs such as interest rates 
the fair value of these credit derivatives  as recognized in other liabilities in our balance sheet at december   was million million 
during  we recorded gains of million million  million in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are exposed to credit risk through our equity investment in channelre  a privately held financial guaranty reinsurance company 
our investment in channelre is subject to potentially significant variability  resulting from mark to market changes  due to changes in credit market conditions 
while the company has no further negative economic exposure to channelre  it is possible that the mark to market will fluctuate  perhaps increasing or decreasing over time  and it is possible that as the underlying securities near maturity  if there are no defaults on the underlying securities for which channelre is obligated  the mark to market adjustment could reverse  perhaps materially 
energy and weather related derivative risk energy and risk management operations through renaissance trading  we transact certain derivative based risk management products primarily to address weather and energy risk and engage in hedging and trading activities related to these risks 
the trading 
table of contents markets for these derivatives are generally linked to energy and agriculture commodities  weather and other natural phenomena 
currently  a significant percentage of the company s derivative based risk management products are transacted on a dual trigger basis combining weather or other natural phenomenon  with prices for commodities or securities related to energy or agriculture 
the fair value of these contracts is obtained through the use of quoted market prices  or in the absence of such quoted prices  industry or internal valuation models 
these contracts are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in other assets and other liabilities and totaled million and million  respectively  at december  million and million  respectively 
during  we generated income related to these derivatives of million million  which is included in other income loss and represents net settlements and changes in the fair value of these contracts 
any realized gains or losses are included in the calculation 
generally  the company s current portfolio of such derivative contracts are of comparably short duration and are frequently seasonal in nature 
it is possible the duration of derivative contracts in this portfolio will lengthen in the future 
we use  among other things  value at risk var analysis to monitor the risks associated with our energy and weather derivatives trading portfolio 
var is a tool that measures the potential loss that could occur if our trading positions were maintained over a defined period of time  calculated at a given statistical confidence level 
due to the seasonal nature of our energy and weather derivatives trading activities  the var is based on a rolling two season one year holding period assuming no dynamic trading during the holding period 
a confidence level is used for the var analysis 
a confidence level implies that within a one year period  the potential loss in our portfolio is not expected to exceed the var estimate in of the possible modeled outcomes 
in the remaining estimated of the possible outcomes  the anticipated potential loss is expected to be higher than the var figure  and on average substantially higher 
the var model  based on a monte carlo simulation methodology  seeks to take into account correlations between different positions and potential for movements to offset one another within the portfolio 
the expected value of the risk factors in our portfolio are generally obtained from exchange traded futures markets 
for most of the risk factors  the volatility is derived from exchange traded options markets 
for those risk factors for which exchange traded options might not exist  the volatility is based on historical analysis matched to broker quotes from the over the counter market  where available 
the joint distribution of outcomes is based on our estimate of the historical seasonal dependence among the underlying risk factors  scaled to the current market levels 
management then estimates the expected outcomes by applying a monte carlo simulation to these risk factors 
the joint distribution of the simulated risk factors is then filtered through the portfolio positions  and then the distribution of the outcomes is realized 
the th percentile of this distribution is then calculated as the portfolio var 
the major limitation of this methodology is that the market data used to forecast parameters of the model may not be an appropriate proxy of those parameters 
the var methodology uses a number of assumptions  such as i risks are measured under average market conditions  assuming normal distribution of market risk factors  ii future movements in market risk factors follow estimated historical movements  and iii the assessed exposures do not change during the holding period 
there is no guarantee that these assumptions will prove correct 
we expect that  for any given period  our actual results will differ from our assumptions  including with respect to previously estimated potential losses and that such losses could be substantially higher than the estimated var 
at december   the estimated var for our portfolio of energy and weather related derivatives  as described above  calculated at an estimated confidence level  was million 
the average  low and high amounts calculated by our var analysis during the year ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 
cat linked securities in addition  we have entered into a credit derivatives agreement with respect to cat linked securities whereby we have sold cat linked securities with a par amount of million at december  million to a bank  while retaining the underlying risk 
the agreement allows us to repurchase these securities at par and obligates us to repurchase the securities under certain circumstances including catastrophe triggering events and events of default 
as a result of this transaction  we are receiving the spread over libor for each of the cat linked securities subject to the credit derivatives agreement  less a financing fee 
the credit derivatives agreement is accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other loss 
we recognized million million  million of other income in our consolidated statements of operations in from this transaction 
a decrease in the value of securities underlying the credit derivatives agreement would negatively impact our results by million 

table of contents equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk due to our investment in a warrant to purchase common shares of platinum  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  as well as to our investments in hedge funds  private equity funds and other investments as described below 
the risk to the platinum warrant is the potential for loss in fair value resulting from a decrease in the price of platinum s common stock 
the aggregate fair value of this investment in platinum was million at december  million 
a hypothetical percent decline in the price of platinum stock  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of the warrant assuming no other changes to the inputs to the black scholes option valuation model that we use 
the decline in the fair value of the warrant would be recorded in other income loss 
we are also indirectly exposed to equity market risk through our investments in some hedge funds that have net long equity positions  private equity partnerships whose exit strategies often depend on the equity markets  such investments totaled million at december  million  and our investments in other ventures  under equity method  which totaled million at december  million 
a hypothetical percent decline in the prices of these hedge funds  private equity partnerships and investments in other ventures  under equity method  holding all other factors constant  would have resulted in a million decline in the fair value of these investments at december
