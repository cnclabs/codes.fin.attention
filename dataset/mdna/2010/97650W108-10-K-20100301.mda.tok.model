item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the net interest margin 
since the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is from customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences and local competition in the market areas in which the banks operate 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in loans and securities that permit the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving an acceptable interest rate spread 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis by management and the risk management committees of the boards of directors of each of the banks and the company 
the objective is to measure the effect on net income and to adjust balance sheet and derivative financial instruments to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize net interest income 
management measures its exposure to changes in interest rates using many different interest rate scenarios 
one interest rate scenario utilized is to measure the percentage change in net interest income assuming a ramped increase and decrease of and basis points that occurs in equal steps over a twelve month time horizon 
utilizing this measurement concept  the interest rate risk of the company  expressed as a percentage change in net interest income over a one year time horizon due to changes in interest rates  at december  and december   is as follows basis basis basis basis points points points points percentage change in net interest income due to a ramped and basis point shift in the yield curve december  december  this simulation analysis is based upon actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments and incorporates management s projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the company as well as other pertinent assumptions 
actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
one method utilized by financial institutions to manage interest rate risk is to enter into derivative financial instruments 
a derivative financial instrument includes interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors  futures  forwards  option contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
additionally  the company enters into commitments to fund certain mortgage loans interest rate locks to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors 
see note of the financial statements presented under item of this report for further information on the company s derivative financial instruments 
during and  the company also entered into certain covered call option transactions related to certain securities held by the company 
the company uses these option transactions rather than entering into other derivative interest rate contracts  such as interest rate floors to increase the total return associated with the related securities 
although the revenue received from these options is recorded as non interest income rather than interest income  the increased return attributable to the related securities from these options contributes to the company s overall profitability 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk may be impacted by these transactions 
to mitigate this risk  the company may acquire fixed rate term debt or use financial derivative instruments 
there were no covered call options outstanding as of december  and
