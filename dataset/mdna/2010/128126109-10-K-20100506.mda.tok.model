overview calamp corp 
calamp or the company develops and markets wireless communications solutions that deliver data  voice and video for critical networked communications and other applications 
the company s two business segments are wireless datacom  which serves utility  governmental and enterprise customers  and satellite  which focuses on the north american direct broadcast satellite market 
the solutions division  the remaining operations of which were sold in august  is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
wireless datacom the wireless datacom segment provides wireless communications technologies  products and services to the wireless networks and mobile resource management markets for a wide range of applications 
calamp has expertise in designing and providing applications involving various combinations of private and public cellular infrastructure networks  narrow band and broad band frequencies  licensed and unlicensed radio spectrum  and mobile and fixed remote communications 
the company s wireless datacom segment is comprised of a wireless networks business and a mobile resource management business 
satellite the company s dbs reception products have historically been sold to the two us dbs system operators  echostar and directv  for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
in fiscal  the company did not make any sales to directv because of pricing and competitive pressures on older generation products 
however  the company is currently developing next generation products for directv with target delivery in fiscal revenue of the company s satellite segment amounted to million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decline in satellite revenue in fiscal years and from pre fiscal levels was the result of a product performance issue that caused echostar  the company s historically largest dbs customer  to substantially reduce its purchases of the company s products 
the company resumed shipments to this customer in fiscal  and sales have continued to ramp up with this customer though fiscal nonetheless  revenues from this customer are still less than pre fiscal levels 
this dbs product performance issue is described in more detail below and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the decline in satellite revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of a reduction of orders from directv  the company s other key dbs customer  due to pricing and competitive pressures  and the time required to get the next generation product qualified with this customer 
during fiscal  the company received notification from one of its dbs customers of a field performance issue with a dbs product that the company began shipping in after examining the various component parts used in the manufacture of these products  it was determined by the company that the performance issue was the result of a deterioration of the printed circuit board pcb laminate material used in these products 
in addition to returning product  in may this dbs customer put on hold all orders for calamp products  including newer generation products  pending the requalification of all products manufactured by the company for this customer 
in january  the customer requalified calamp s designs for the affected products and in late may the company resumed product shipments to this customer 
during fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million for this matter  which amount is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company reached a settlement agreement with this customer in december as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the company agreed to rework certain dbs products previously returned to the company or to be returned over a month period and agreed to provide extended warranty periods for workmanship months and product failures due to the issue with the pcb laminate material months 
in addition  as part of the settlement the company issued to the customer a million non interest bearing note payable  a million credit against outstanding receivables due from the customer   shares of common stock and  common stock purchase warrants exercisable at per share for three years 
the note was repaid during fiscal at february   the company had total reserves of million for this matter 
in may  the company filed a lawsuit against rogers  a pcb laminate supplier for negligence  strict product liability  intentional misrepresentation and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage  among other causes of action 
in january  the company reached an out of court settlement of litigation with rogers  pursuant to which rogers paid the company million cash 
in the settlement agreement the parties acknowledged that rogers admitted no wrongdoing or liability for any claim  and that rogers agreed to settle this litigation to avoid the time  expense and inconvenience of continued litigation 
both parties gave mutual releases of all claims and demands existing as of the settlement date 
discontinued operations the company sold the telalert software business of the solutions division to a privately held company on august  for total consideration of million  consisting of million in cash  a non interest bearing note with a discounted value of million and preferred stock of the acquirer initially valued at million 
the telalert software business was the remaining business of the solutions division 
operating results for the solutions division have been presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a discontinued operation in fiscal  as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of february   the estimated fair value of the preferred stock that the company received in the sale of telalert business was million 
the company concluded that this decline in fair value was not temporary and accordingly recorded an impairment loss of million in fiscal in july  the company s sold this preferred stock to a group of investors not affiliated with the company 
the carrying value of this investment at the time of sale was million  and the sales price was million 
the loss of million is included in the non operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended february  as of february   the  principal balance of the note that the company received in the sale of telalert is due in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of  with a final principal and interest installment of  due on january  critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts based upon a review and evaluation of specific customer accounts identified as known and expected collection problems  based on historical experience  or due to insolvency or other collection issues 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company s customer base is concentrated  with one customer accounting for almost half of the company s fiscal sales 
changes in either a key customer s financial position  or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the recorded allowance amount 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values  inventory carrying amounts are written down 
in addition  the company generally treats inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  that is not expected to be sold within the next months  as excess and thus appropriate write downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of revenues 
estimated usage in the next months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management s estimate of sales beyond existing backlog  giving consideration to customers forecasted demand  ordering patterns and product life cycles 
significant reductions in product pricing  or changes in technology and or demand may necessitate additional write downs of inventory carrying value in the future 
product warranties the company initially provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while it engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  at february  the company had a million reserve for accrued warranty costs in connection with a product performance issue involving a key dbs customer 
the company believes that this warranty reserve will be adequate to cover total future product rework costs under this settlement agreement 
deferred income tax and uncertain tax positions deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized if realization of such asset is more likely than not  based upon the weight of available evidence that includes historical operating performance and the company s forecast of future operating performance 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred income tax assets and a valuation allowance is provided  as necessary 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred income tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
as of march   the company adopted an accounting pronouncement related to financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  income taxes  formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which established a framework for determining the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions 
fasb asc topic uses a two step approach in which a tax benefit is recognized if a position is more likely than not to be sustained 
the amount of the benefit is then measured as the highest tax benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon settlement 
fasb asc topic also established new disclosure requirements related to tax reserves 
at february   the company had unrecognized tax benefits of  which  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate on income loss from continuing operations 
at february   the company had a net deferred income tax asset balance of million 
the current portion of this deferred tax asset is million and the noncurrent portion is million 
the net deferred income tax asset balance is comprised of a gross deferred tax asset of million and a valuation allowance of million 
impairment assessments of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets at february   the company had million in other intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes the estimate of its valuation of long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of non goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on the balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  the company typically makes various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  considers market factors specific to that business and estimates future cash flows to be generated by that business 
these assumptions and estimates are necessarily subjective and based on management s best estimates based on the information available at the time such estimates are made 
based on these assumptions and estimates  the company determines whether it needs to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on the balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and its internal forecasts 
although management believes the assumptions and estimates that have been made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the company s reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges in the statement of operations  and lower asset values on the balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges 
the fair values were determined using discounted cash flow dcf analyses of financial projections for each reporting unit 
stock based compensation expense the company measures stock based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognizes the expense over the employee s requisite service vesting period using the straight line method 
the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
certain of these inputs are subjective to some degree and are determined based in part on management s judgment 
the company recognizes the compensation expense on a straight line basis for its graded vesting awards 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
however  the cumulative compensation expense recognized at any point in time must at least equal the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
as used in this context  the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations  and refers only to the unvested portion of the surrendered equity awards 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
in cases where terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
critical judgments made by management related to revenue recognition include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 
products sold in connection with service contracts are recorded as deferred revenues and the associated product costs are recorded as deferred costs 
these deferred amounts are recognized over the life of the service contract on a straight line basis 
the company also undertakes projects that include the design  development and manufacture of public safety communication systems that are specially customized to customers specifications or that involve fixed site construction 
sales under such contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
estimated revenues and costs are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
critical estimates made by management related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method include the estimation of costs at completion and the determination of the overall margin rate on the specific project

corporate expenses in fiscal include an impairment charge of million on an investment in preferred stock of a privately held company 
satellite s negative gross profit of million and operating loss of million in fiscal include a million charge for estimated expenses to correct a product performance issue involving key dbs customer  as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the operating loss of million for that period also includes a goodwill impairment charge of million 
wireless datacom s operating loss of million in fiscal includes a goodwill impairment charge of million 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue satellite revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as discussed above  the company s historically largest dbs customer put on hold all orders with the company in late may  including orders for newer generation products  pending a requalification of all products manufactured by calamp for this customer 
in january  the customer requalified calamp s designs for the affected products and in late may the company resumed product shipments to this customer 
revenues from this dbs customer were million higher for fiscal compared to the previous year 
however  there were no sales to the company s other dbs customer in fiscal compared to sales of million in the previous year due to pricing and competitive pressures on older generation products and the time required to get the next generation products qualified with this customer 
the company is currently developing next generation products for this customer with target delivery in fiscal wireless datacom revenue declined by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue is due to lower sales by the wireless datacom business units as the result of the global economic downturn 
gross profit loss and gross margins satellite gross profit was million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
the gross profit in fiscal was benefited by i a million gain from a legal settlement with a supplier that was recorded as a reduction of cost of revenues  ii million associated with the sale of satellite products for which the inventory cost had been fully reserved in the prior fiscal year  and iii a reduction of million in estimated costs to correct a product performance issue 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal compared to the previous year after excluding the aforementioned benefits was due primarily to higher satellite revenue 
wireless datacom gross profit decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal wireless datacom gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to the decline in revenue and partly to the million patent sale last year for which there was no associated cost 
excluding the patent sale  wireless datacom gross margin was in fiscal see also note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses consolidated research and development r d expense decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these decreases are primarily due to personnel reductions in the wireless networks business unit of the wireless datacom segment 
consolidated selling expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily because selling expenses in fiscal were benefited by bad debt reserve reductions of  related to a wireless datacom customer 
consolidated general and administrative expenses g a decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to cost reduction actions implemented by the company 
other factors contributing to the decrease were i a  decrease in legal expense in the current year compared to last year  and ii a  charge for severance costs of the company s former satellite division president in fiscal partially offsetting the effect of these year over year expense reductions in g a was an increase of  in stock based compensation expense because the g a in fiscal included a reduction of stock compensation expense as the result of the forfeiture of unvested stock options upon the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer in march amortization of intangibles decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these reductions are attributable to the lower carrying value of intangible assets as a result of the impairment write down recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal non operating expense  net net non operating expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to the loss on the sale of an investment in the preferred stock of a privately held company of million in fiscal and a  foreign currency loss also in fiscal  compared to a foreign currency gain of  gain in fiscal these losses were partially offset by a decrease in net interest expense of  as a result of lower average outstanding bank debt during fiscal income tax provision the tax benefit of million in fiscal was related to the reversal of an uncertain tax position which was resolved 
this uncertain tax position reversal was recorded as an income tax benefit because the benefit had been recognized in the applicable income tax returns but had not previously been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
no other tax benefit was recorded in fiscal because future realizability of such tax benefits is not considered to be more likely than not 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue satellite revenue declined million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales to the company s historically largest dbs customer declined by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal also  sales to the company s other dbs customer declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to a reduction of orders caused by pricing and competitive pressures  and the time required to get the next generation product qualified with this customer 
wireless datacom revenue decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal more than half of the decrease was due to a decline in sales of radio modules to a key wireless datacom customer due to the demand volatility for that customer s radio products from government agencies 
the remainder of the decrease was due to lower revenues of the wireless datacom businesses attributable to the economic downturn  which caused both commercial and governmental customers to defer buying decisions 
gross profit loss and gross margins satellite had gross profit of million in fiscal  compared with a negative gross profit of million in fiscal satellite s negative gross profit of million in fiscal includes a million charge for estimated expenses to correct a product performance issue involving a key dbs customer 
the gross profit in fiscal was benefited by i a million gain from a legal settlement with a supplier that was recorded as reduction of cost of revenues  ii million associated with the sale of satellite products for which the inventory cost had been fully reserved in the prior fiscal year  and iii a reduction of million in estimated costs to correct a product performance issue 
wireless datacom gross profit decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due mainly to the decrease in revenues 
wireless datacom s gross margin increased by from in fiscal to in fiscal this margin improvement was due primarily to a million patent sale in the first quarter of fiscal for which the cost of revenues was zero 
excluding the patent sale  wireless datacom s gross margin was in fiscal operating expenses consolidated r d expense decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these decreases were primarily due to personnel reductions in the wireless networks business of the wireless datacom segment 
consolidated selling expenses decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to bad debt reserve reductions of  related to a wireless datacom customer 
consolidated g a expense decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction of approximately million in g a of the wireless networks business  which included smartlink acquisition integration costs of approximately  in fiscal that were not present in fiscal  and lower stock based compensation expense of  the reduction in stock based compensation expense included in g a was primarily attributable to the forfeiture of unvested stock options upon the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer in march partially offsetting the effect of the lower stock based compensation expense and the nonrecurring smartlink integration costs in fiscal was a  charge for severance costs of the company s former satellite president in the second quarter of fiscal amortization of intangibles decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these decreases were primarily attributable to the contracts backlog intangible assets arising from the may acquisitions of dataradio and the technocom mrm product line that became fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal the in process research and development iprd write off of  for fiscal was related to the acquisition of smartlink in april non operating expense  net non operating expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the million decrease was primarily due to i a foreign currency gain of  in fiscal compared to a  foreign currency loss in fiscal  and ii a decrease in net interest expense of  because of lower debt in fiscal and because the banks waived previously assessed fees and interest charges of approximately  in january this effect was partially offset by a gain of  on the sale of an investment that was recorded in fiscal income tax provision income tax expense allocated to loss from continuing operations for the year ended february  was million
