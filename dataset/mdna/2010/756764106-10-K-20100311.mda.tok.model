item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a nyse listed hospitality and leisure company ticker symbols rlh and rlh pa primarily engaged in the ownership  operation and franchising of midscale  full  select and limited service hotels under our proprietary red lion brand 
established over years ago  the red lion brand is nationally recognized and particularly well known in the western united states  where all of our hotels are located 
the red lion brand is typically associated with three star full and select service hotels 
as of december   our hotel system contained hotels located in eight states and one canadian province  with  rooms and  square feet of meeting space as provided below total meeting available space hotels rooms sq 
ft 
red lion owned and leased hotels red lion franchised hotels total we operate in three reportable segments the hotels segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels 
the franchise segment is engaged primarily in licensing the red lion brand to franchisees 
this segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our central services programs 
these programs include the reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  quality inspections  advertising and brand standards 
it has also historically reflected revenue from management fees charged to the owners of managed hotels 
we have not managed any hotels for third parties since january the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from ticketing services and promotion and presentation of entertainment productions 
our remaining activities  none of which constitutes a reportable segment  have been aggregated into other  and are primarily related to our direct ownership interest in a retail mall that is attached to one of our hotels and to other miscellaneous real estate investments 
results of operations for the year ended december   our net loss was million or per share  which includes a non cash impairment loss of million 
of that amount  million was related to our red lion denver southeast hotel  which we acquired in may for million  and on which we subsequently spent million in renovations 
since acquisition  the denver market has experienced a substantial and sustained decline in demand for hotel rooms across all market segments 
the remaining million impairment loss related to a second property 
during  we reported a net loss of approximately million or per share  and in reported net income of million or per share 
the million net loss in included a million charge recorded during the first quarter of for separation costs associated with the retirement of our former president and chief executive officer in february in addition  during the fourth quarters of and we recorded million and million in restructuring expenses  respectively

table of contents ebitda represents net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation before interest expense  income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization 
we utilize ebitda as a financial measure because management believes that investors find it a useful tool to perform more meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core  on going operations 
we believe it is a complement to net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation and other financial performance measures 
ebitda is not intended to represent net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  and such information should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prescribed by gaap 
we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our owned and leased hotels because we believe interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization bear little or no relationship to our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
we generally pay federal and state income taxes on a consolidated basis  taking into account how the applicable taxing laws apply to us in the aggregate 
by excluding taxes on income  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding factors that our hotels cannot control 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from hotel to hotel based on historical cost and other factors unrelated to the hotels financial performance  ebitda measures the financial performance of our hotels without regard to their historical cost 
for all of these reasons  we believe ebitda provides us and investors with information that is relevant and useful in evaluating our business 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda  as defined by us  may not be comparable to ebitda as reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation  which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income loss or net income loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

also during  undistributed corporate expenses included a million charge for separation costs 
other undistributed corporate expense decreased  or million  during compared to  as a direct result of cost containment measures 
the net gain on asset dispositions reflects the ongoing recognition of deferred gains on a previously sold hotel for which we entered into a long term lease arrangement  offset by asset disposition losses throughout the year 
undistributed corporate expenses include general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  legal expenses  director and officers insurance  bank service charges and outside accountants and various other expenses 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not further distributed

inflation the effect of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the us consumer price index  has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods under review 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we consider a critical accounting policy to be one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  we have also identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates below 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition and receivables revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
when we receive payment from customers before our services have been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the service has been completed 
we recognize revenue from the following sources hotels room rental and food and beverage sales from owned and leased hotels 
revenues are recognized when our services have been performed  generally at the time of the hotel stay or guest s visit to the restaurant 
this treatment is consistent with others within our industry 
our revenues are significantly impacted by global  national and regional economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry  as well as the relative market share of our hotels compared with our competitors 
franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of our brand names 
franchise revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the franchise agreements 
entertainment computerized event ticketing services and promotion of broadway style shows and other special events 
where we act as an agent and receive a net fee or commission  it is recognized as revenue in the period the services are performed 
when we are the promoter of an event and are at risk for the production  revenues and expenses are recorded in the period of the event performance 
other primarily from rental income received from our direct ownership interest in a retail mall in kalispell  montana that is attached to our red lion hotel 

table of contents we review the ability to collect individual accounts receivable on a routine basis 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and amounts that are past due beyond a certain date 
a receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
long lived assets property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make judgments regarding estimated future cash flows from the respective properties  which is dependent upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which our cash flows will occur  the determination of real estate and prevailing market values  asset appraisals and  if available and appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers or net sales proceeds from previous  comparable transactions 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
changes to our plans  including a decision to sell  dispose of or change the intended use of an asset  could have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset 
in accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long lived assets  assets held and used with a carrying amount of million were written down to their fair value of million  resulting in a non cash impairment loss of million for the year ended december  of that amount  million was related to our red lion denver southeast hotel  which we acquired in may for million  and on which we subsequently spent million in renovations 
since acquisition  the denver market has experienced a substantial and sustained decline in demand for hotel rooms across all market segments 
the remaining million impairment loss related to a second property 
we used level inputs for our discounted cash flow analyses  including growth rate  property level preformed financial information and remaining lives of the assets 
management bases these assumptions on historical data and experience and future operational expectations 
for certain assets  we used recent asset appraisals or valuations performed by third parties  which we deemed to be level inputs  to support our estimate of fair value 
intangible assets our intangible assets include brands and goodwill  which we do not amortize 
instead  we test for impairment annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  subject to the same general assumptions discussed above for long lived assets 
at december  and  our recorded goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization remained unchanged at million 
while we have not recognized an impairment loss since we originally recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  changes in our estimates and assumptions could affect  potentially materially  our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company s estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rate  and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend 
our other intangible assets include marketing and lease contracts  the values of which are amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average life of the agreements and totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and the assessment of these contracts requires us to make certain judgments  including estimated future cash flow from the applicable properties

asc or the codification establishes the fasb asc as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead the fasb will issue accounting standards updates 
accounting standards updates will not be authoritative in their own right as they will only serve to update the codification 
these changes and the codification itself do not change gaap 
we adopted these changes on september   and other than the manner in which new accounting guidance is referenced  the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fair value accounting on january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb to fair value accounting and reporting as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis 
these changes define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
the adoption of these changes  as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  had no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements other than additional required disclosures 
on june   we adopted changes issued by the fasb to fair value disclosures of financial instruments 
these changes require a publicly traded company to include disclosures about the fair value of its financial instruments whenever it issues summarized financial information for interim reporting periods 
such disclosures include the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  the related carrying amount of these financial instruments  and the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value 
other than the required disclosures in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the adoption of these changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations effective january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb modifying how business acquisitions occurring on or after that date are accounted for 
these changes address consistent fair value measurements and apply to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements on january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb to consolidation accounting and reporting via retroactive application of the presentation and disclosure requirements 
these changes established accounting and reporting for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this guidance defines a noncontrolling interest  previously called a minority interest  as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
as required  we record noncontrolling interests as a component of equity separate from the parent company s equity 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is included on the income statement separate from net income loss from our operations 
determination of the useful life of intangible assets on january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb to accounting for intangible assets 
the changes amend the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset in order to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset outside of a business combination and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an intangible asset in a business combination 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
share based payment awards on january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb that addressed whether instruments granted in share based payment awards are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  must be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method 
these changes require that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents be treated as participating securities in calculating earnings per share 
these changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

accounting for transfers of financial assets in june  the fasb issued changes that eliminate the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  clarify and amend the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale  amend and clarify the unit of account eligible for sale accounting  and require that a transferor initially measure at fair value and recognize all assets obtained and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of an entire financial asset or group of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
additionally  on and after the effective date  existing qspe s must be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
these changes will require enhanced disclosures about  among other things  a transferor s continuing involvement with transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales  the risks inherent in the transferred financial assets that have been retained  and the nature and financial effect of restrictions on the transferor s assets that continue to be reported in the consolidated financial statements 
these changes will be effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin after november  the adoption of these changes are not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued changes to the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity vie 
these changes also amend the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the new guidance also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  where previously  reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie was only required when specific events had occurred 
qspes will also be subject to these changes in consolidation guidance when effective 
enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie will be required

at the same time  we also amended our five year loan with restrictive covenants that mirror those of the credit facility
