item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations overview we are primarily engaged in real estate land sales and development  reinvestment of land sales proceeds into income properties  and golf course operations 
we own approximately  acres in florida  of which approximately  are located within and form a substantial portion of the western boundary of the city of daytona beach 
our lands are well located in the central florida interstate corridor  providing an opportunity for reasonably stable land sales in future years 
with our substantial land holdings in daytona beach  we have parcels available for the entire spectrum of real estate uses 
along with land sales  we selectively develop parcels primarily for commercial uses 
although pricing levels and changes by us and our immediate competitors can affect sales  we generally enjoy a competitive edge due to low costs associated with long time land ownership and a significant ownership position in the immediate market 
as a general policy we do not discount sales prices to accelerate land sales 
until the dramatic downturn in the national and local economies in  sales activity on company owned lands had been strong over several years 
sales during consisted of the sale of acres of land  of which fourteen acres were uplands and two acres were wetlands 
development activities on and around company owned lands continued relatively strong throughout and into with the commencement and completion of projects planned or in process before the downturn 
sales and development activities over the last several years included the sale of acres of land to florida hospital for the construction of a new hospital  which opened in july of this year  the expansion of the daytona beach auto mall  the opening of a second office building in the cornerstone office park  continued development within the acre gateway commerce park where a  square foot industrial building was completed in early and the acre interstate commerce park  both adjacent to interstate  and the sale of approximately acres of land west of interstate on which father lopez  a private high school  was constructed and opened in august in early  the city of daytona beach police headquarters  located adjacent to gateway commerce park  was completed and occupied 
also in  construction was completed on a unit apartment complex and a medical office building  with development of a townhouse residential community on the east side of interstate continuing 
during the first quarter of  construction commenced on an upscale restaurant on a parcel adjacent to the interstate and lpga boulevard interchange  which the company sold during the fourth quarter of this restaurant facility  vince carter s  opened for business in february on the west side of interstate  development has been completed on a fire station  a hotel  and a  square foot furniture retail store  furniture row  in the interstate commerce park  along with a new elementary school which opened in august historical sales and profits are not indicative of future results because of the discrete nature of land sales and variations in the cost basis of owned land 
a significant portion of the company s profits  in any given year  are generated through relatively large discreet commercial land sales transactions 
the process for these land sales transactions  from the time of preliminary discussions through contract negotiations  due diligence periods  and the closing  can last from several months to several years 
the trend in company profits in through  in particular profits from real estate sales during that period  followed the overall general trend of the national and local economies and the real estate markets 
the residential real estate market reached its peak in late and early with the market  hampered by the overall economy and credit crisis  reaching its low point in and the local commercial real estate market lagged the residential market downturn by approximately two years 
the company was able to close sales contracts during which were generated during the years of the strong real estate market 
we entered with a relatively strong contract backlog of real estate contracts 
as the economy  real estate markets  and credit markets continued to slow  several of the contracts in place did not result in closings as buyers took a more conservative approach 
we do not expect a significant improvement in economic conditions  in particular the real estate market  throughout 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  we initiated a strategy of investing in income properties utilizing the proceeds of agricultural land sales qualifying for income tax deferral through like kind exchange treatment for tax purposes 
through the end of  we had invested approximately million in twenty six income properties through this process 
with this investment base in income properties  lease revenue of approximately million is projected to be generated annually 
this income  along with income from additional net lease income property investments  is expected to decrease earnings volatility in future years and add to overall financial performance 
this has enabled us to enter into the business of building  leasing  and holding in our portfolio select income properties that are strategically located on our lands 
in the third quarter of  we were notified by barnes noble that it would be vacating its store in lakeland  florida  upon the expiration of the original lease term at the end of january the building has since been vacated by barnes noble 
the company is exploring all strategic alternatives on this  square foot property 
all remaining properties remain leased with the average remaining lease term in excess of years  excluding additional option years 
the barnes noble store in daytona beach  florida  which has a lease termination date at the end of january  excluding option years  is the next lease up for renewal 
no other leases have less than six years remaining on the initial lease term 
during the fourth quarter of rbc centura bank closed its branch in altamonte springs  florida 
the tenant is obligated on the lease and continues to make lease payments 
we currently have two self developed projects in the lease up stage 
the first project is a two building  square foot flex office space complex located within gateway commerce park 
construction of these buildings was completed in as of december   there was one tenant under lease for approximately  square feet  with negotiations ongoing with additional tenant prospects 
the second property is the first phase of a acre  lot commercial complex located at the northeast corner of lpga and williamson boulevards in daytona beach  florida 
the parcel includes a  square foot class a office building 
with the exception of additional tenant improvements  which are to be made as vacant space is leased  construction of the building has been completed 
approximately of the building is under lease to two tenants  with both tenants beginning occupancy in the third quarter of golf operations consist of the operation of two golf courses  a clubhouse facility  and food and beverage activities within the lpga international mixed use residential community on the west side of interstate  south and east of lpga boulevard 
the champions course was designed by rees jones and the legends course was designed by arthur hills 
prior to  golf operations revenues had grown despite an overall decline in golf course revenues in florida 
the florida golf industry has been hurt by over building of golf courses and hurricane activity in past years 
during  we made changes in management within the golf operation looking for improved operating results for the future 
the overall weak national and local economies led to continued losses in and throughout we believe that improvement in golf course operations will be a function of stronger economic conditions  increased tourist demand  a reduction in new golf course construction which has been experienced in the last several years  and most importantly  increased residential growth in lpga international and adjoining land to the west and northwest 
lpga international and nearby projects currently under development are planned to contain about  additional dwelling units 
our efforts to improve revenues and profitability have focused on providing quality products and services while maintaining consistent and stringent cost control for both golf course and food service activities 
our agricultural operations consist of growing  managing  and selling timber and hay on approximately  acres of land on the west side of daytona beach  florida 
we are currently in the process of converting a significant portion of our timberlands to hay production

these profits represented an decline from calendar year profits of  equivalent to

the decrease in profitability was primarily attributable to lower profits from land sales  in addition to substantially higher general and administrative expenses due to increased expenses associated with stock option accruals 
a decrease in the price of our stock in resulted in an addition to income of  after income taxes  related to reductions in stock option accruals for that year

this mortgage note  which was secured by acres of property  was also written off with the land recorded in land and development costs in the amount of  there was no gain or loss recognized on either transaction 
in determining impairment on the notes receivable we evaluated the fair market value of the property collateralizing the loan based on our knowledge of the daytona beach real estate market as the largest landowner  and obtained independent appraisals to support the values 
during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to  the authorization permits us to effect the repurchases from time to time through a variety of methods including open market repurchases and privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase plan is intended to be funded through reduced dividend payments in the future 
we have no plans to increase debt to fund the repurchase plan 
through march    shares had been repurchased at a total cost of  with no repurchases occurring in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures planned for are projected to be approximately  these expenditures include  for the acquisition of approximately acres of land through the irs section process  mentioned earlier   for the continuation of our hay conversion and  for funding of road construction 
additional funds will be expended on tenant improvements on our self developed income properties and the recently vacated property in lakeland  florida as leases are secured  other than the  commitment to road construction  capital expenditures can be reduced at our discretion based on operating cash needs 
the funds for road construction come as the results of efforts at the end of to obtain federal stimulus dollars to extend dunn avenue  a major east west thoroughfare bridging interstate  to provide improved access to company lands 
in june  the company entered into a cost sharing agreement with the city of daytona beach and the county of volusia that will allow the use of federal funds to build this road project

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we also believe that we have the ability  if needed  to borrow on a non recourse basis against our existing income properties  which are all free of debt as of the date of this filing 
as additional funds become available through qualified sales  we expect to reinvest in additional real estate opportunities 
our board of directors and management continually review the allocation of any excess capital with the goal of providing the highest long term return for all shareholders 
the reviews consider various alternatives  including increasing or decreasing regular dividends  declaring special dividends  repurchasing stock  and retaining funds for reinvestment  including road development and hay conversion of timber lands 
the board of directors has reaffirmed its support for the stated business plan of reinvesting agricultural land sales proceeds into tax deferred income producing properties  self development of income properties  and the creation of infrastructure and entitlements on company lands to increase long term shareholder value 
at its regular board of directors meeting on january   the company declared a dividend of 
per share 
the company recognizes the importance of providing a quarterly dividend and maintaining that commitment during the recent economic downturn 
the board of directors believed it appropriate to reduce the dividend at this time  from 
paid in the prior quarter  in order to conserve capital due to the continuing weakness in the real estate industry 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain development obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis at december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings 
payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating leases obligations development obligations total critical accounting policies the profit on sales of real estate is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the accounting for sales of real estate topic of fasb asc 
we recognize revenue from the sale of real estate at the time the sale is consummated unless the property is sold on a deferred payment plan and the initial payment does not meet established criteria or we retain continuing involvement with the property 
a majority of our land sales contracts contain an anti speculation clause 
this clause requires the buyer to begin construction of their project within a specified period of time 
if this requirement is not met  we have the right  but not the obligation  to repurchase the property at its original sales price 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued all transactions closed in and met the criteria established under the accounting for sales of real estate topic of fasb asc  and no income was deferred from the transactions at december  prior to  we closed transactions for which we had post closing obligations to provide off site utilities and or road improvements and thus a portion of the revenues and profits were deferred 
full cash payment was received at closing  and warranty deeds were transferred and recorded 
the sales contracts did not provide any offsets  rescission  or buy back if the improvements were not made 
total profits deferred at december  on these transactions amounted to  during  all post closing obligations were completed  and the  of profits deferred at december   was recognized during we acquire income properties with long term leases in place 
upon acquisition  the portion of the purchase price which represents the market value associated with the lease is allocated to an intangible asset 
the amount of the intangible asset represents the cost of replacing the tenant should the lease be discontinued 
factors such as vacancy period  tenant improvements  and lease commissions  among others  are considered in calculating the intangible asset 
the intangible asset is amortized over the remaining life of the lease at the time of acquisition 
at december   the intangible asset associated with the income properties totaled  net of amortization of  at december  and the intangible assets totaled  and  respectively 
these amounts were net of amortization of  and  for and  respectively 
in accordance with the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets topic of fasb asc we have reviewed the recoverability of long lived assets  including real estate development  income properties  and other property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may or may not be recoverable 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment by using an undiscounted cash flow approach which considers future estimated capital expenditures 
impairment on long lived assets is measured at fair value by estimating discounted future operating cash flow and sales price  less cost to sell 
there has been no impairment of long lived assets reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
at the time our debt was refinanced in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
this swap arrangement changes the variable rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed cash flows so that we can manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
this swap arrangement essentially creates the equivalent of fixed rate debt 
the above referenced transaction is accounted for under the accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities topic of fasb asc 
the accounting requires the derivative to be recognized on the balance sheet at its fair value and the changes in fair value to be accounted for as other comprehensive income or loss 
we measure the ineffectiveness of the interest rate swap derivative by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the swap with the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
this measure resulted in no ineffectiveness for the three years ended december  a liability in the amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  has been established on our balance sheet 
the change in fair value  net of applicable taxes  in the cumulative amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  has been recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss  a component of shareholders equity 
we maintain a stock option plan pursuant to which  shares of our common stock may be issued 
the current plan was approved at the april  shareholders meeting 
under the plan  the option exercise price equals the stock market price on the date of grant 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the options generally vest over five years and all expire after ten years 
the plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options  which satisfy the requirements of internal revenue code irc section  and non qualified options  which are not entitled to favorable tax treatment under irc section no optionee may exercise incentive stock options in any calendar year for shares of common stock having a total market value of more than  on the date of grant subject to certain carryover provisions 
in connection with the grant of non qualified options  a stock appreciation right for each share covered by the option may also be granted 
the stock appreciation right will entitle the optionee to receive a supplemental payment  which may be paid in whole or in part in cash or in shares of common stock  equal to a portion of the spread between the exercise price and the fair market value of the underlying shares at the time of exercise 
all options granted to date have been non qualified options 
both our stock options and stock appreciation rights are liability classified awards under the share based payment topic of fasb asc and are required to be remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risk ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed is interest rates 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities 
we do not believe that its interest rate risk related to cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
we manage our debt  considering investment opportunities and risk  tax consequences  and overall financial strategies 
we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk on our   outstanding at december  long term mortgage 
the borrowing bears a variable rate of interest based on market rates 
management s objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement during the second quarter of a hypothetical change in the interest rate of basis points ie would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
