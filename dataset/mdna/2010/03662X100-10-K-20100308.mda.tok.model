table of contents general we own and operate answers 
com  a leading q a site  dedicated to providing useful answers to questions about anything 
answers 
com includes wikianswers and referenceanswers 
wikianswers is a community generated social knowledge q a platform  leveraging wiki based technologies 
through the contributions of the community  our questions and answers are continuously growing  improving and being updated  to form the world s greatest q a database 
referenceanswers provides trusted editorial content on millions of topics licensed from what we believe to be the world s top reference publishers 
referenceanswers usually provides the best results for simple questions of the who is  what is variety 
more complex questions are better handled by wikianswers 
our goal is to become the dominant and recognized market leader for answers on the internet 
according to our internal estimates  answers 
com generated million average daily page views in compared to million average daily page views in according to comscore  under its new hybrid audience measurement methodology  answers 
com had million unique visitors in the us in january  ranking the site number among the top us web properties for that month 
also according to comscore  answers 
com had approximately million unique visitors worldwide in january  ranking us number worldwide 
new answers 
com integration of wikianswers and referenceanswers in september we announced the launch of the new answers 
com  in recognition of the integration of our two web properties  culminating a process that began several quarters earlier 
answers 
com is the name we now use for our combined site  as well as our umbrella brand  and is comprised of two properties or sub brands  wikianswers and referenceanswers 
the product strategy guiding the integration was our desire to give users one address for the best answers to all types of questions be they community generated from wikianswers  or editorially licensed from referenceanswers 
the first stages of the integration were minor creating a similar look and feel for  and cross linking between  the properties 
thus  for example  a user looking up michael jackson in referenceanswers  arrived at a page displaying reference content covering the specific query  in addition to being asked to answer wikianswers unanswered questions relating to michael jackson 
the result page also resembled a wikianswers page by way of including the standard ask and answer bar in the header of the page  as opposed to the original search button displayed adjacent to the query bar 
subsequently  we added an all radio button adjacent to the query bar on both properties  allowing users  should they choose  to find a result by searching both properties 
in the second quarter of  we took an additional and important step in integrating both web properties by making the all radio button the default setting above the query box of both properties 
as a result of this user interface change  users typing in queries into either of our properties are automatically directed to the web page our algorithms deem most appropriate as a response 
for example  a user typing the query  when did wwii start in referenceanswers  lands on a web page belonging to wikianswers with an answer to that question 
a user typing the query who is oprah winfrey in wikianswers  arrives at a referenceanswers page displaying the oprah winfrey topic 
in september  we took our final step in integrating the two web properties by creating a new unified answers 
com home page and login  integrating features from both properties  and making other changes in our user interface to strengthen our positioning as having one dominant product and brand  answers 
com  comprised of the two properties  wikianswers and referenceanswers 
how we generate revenue traffic our revenue is driven by the traffic generated by answers 
com and our ability to effectively monetize that traffic 
search engines  primarily google  are responsible for most of the traffic to answers 
com 
users submit queries and search engines respond by generating a list of web pages that they deem likely to offer the most relevant content 
when an answers 
com page ranks high in the algorithmic systems of search engines  our results are more likely to be accessed by users 
for the three and twelve months ended december   according to our internal estimates  this source of traffic represented approximately and  respectively  of answers 
com s traffic 
for the three and twelve months ended december   according to our internal estimates  this source of traffic represented approximately and  respectively  of answers 
com s traffic 

table of contents the balance of the traffic arriving at answers 
com in and originated from direct usage  ie  users visiting our home page and or navigating within answers 
com  and from users who have clicked on google s definition link feature 
beginning in  we benefited from an informal  non contractual relationship with google under which google linked certain search results related to definitional queries to referenceanswers 
this link or links  in the case of multiple phrase queries appeared at the right end of the blue header bar for google search results 
for the nine months ended september   according to our internal estimates  this source of traffic represented approximately of our overall traffic and revenue 
in october  google informed us that beginning sometime during the fourth quarter of  they would no longer be sending us traffic from the google definition link 
we began to see the impact of this change at various points in the fourth quarter  and by the end of  this traffic ceased 
search engines  at any time and for any reason  could change their algorithms that direct search queries to answers 
com or other web properties  or could restrict the flow of users visiting answers 
com specifically 
in fact  we have previously experienced decreases in traffic  and consequently in revenue  in response to such search engine action 
thus  we expend resources guarding and improving the volume of this traffic 
the industry commonly refers to such efforts as search engine optimization  or seo 
we often refer to traffic from search engines as seo traffic 
we also focus on the quality of our q a database  since a potential result of poor quality content may be a negative impact on our seo traffic 
seasonality our results of operations have historically been affected by seasonal traffic patterns and advertising demand 
many of our users are students who utilize our web properties as reference sources 
our traffic fluctuates with the academic school year  rising from january through may  falling to lower levels during the summer months  rising again in september through november  and falling again in december  coinciding with school breaks and the holiday season 
we expect traffic to our web properties to continue to fluctuate seasonally in the future 
this seasonal fluctuation in traffic results in a fluctuation in our quarterly revenues  since lower traffic to answers 
com translates into fewer users clicking on or viewing the advertisements we display 
our current seasonal patterns may become more pronounced or may change as we grow domestically 
monetization advertising revenue 
we earn practically all of our revenue from advertising 
there are two primary categories of internet advertising pay per performance  also known as cost per click cpc  and pay per impression display ads or cost per  impressions cpm in the cpc model  we earn revenue based on the number of clicks associated with an ad  in the cpm model  we derive revenue from the display of ads 
the overwhelming majority of our advertising revenue is earned from cpc advertising 
we obtain all of our cpc  and most of our cpm advertisements from third party ad networks 
these ad networks compensate us by paying us a portion of the revenue they earn from advertisers for our provision of promotional space on our web properties 
our primary third party ad network  google adsense  accounted for approximately of our total revenue in  as compared to approximately of our total revenue in we obtain practically all our cpc ads from google 
in addition to google  we utilize the services of other third party ad networks that provide us with cpm ads 
we expect that for the foreseeable future  cpc ads will continue to generate the overwhelming majority of our revenue  and we have no plans to reduce our reliance on cpc ads 
our relationship with google is governed by our google services agreement  or gsa  which was recently renewed for a two year period ending january  we participate in two google adsense programs  adsense for search or afs and adsense for content or afc 
afs is the online service for distributing relevant ads from google s advertisers for search results on google network members sites 
afc  on the other hand  is google s online service for distributing ads from its advertisers that are relevant to content on its network members web sites 
under this program  google uses automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web page and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content 
queries resulting in wikianswers pages are almost always monetized via afc ads  while queries triggering referenceanswers pages are mostly monetized via afs ads 
for a full discussion explaining our monetization and traffic metrics  please refer to the first section in this annual report  titled references to web property usage measurements 

table of contents direct ad sales 
in the second quarter of  we decided to suspend our direct ad sales efforts and to instead focus on selling ads through third party advertising networks  primarily google adsense 
in the second and third quarter of we terminated all of our direct ad sales employees 
this decision allowed us to focus on our core competency growing the community  growing our traffic and monetizing via google and other ad networks 
notwithstanding the lack of a direct ad sales team  we are occasionally approached directly by advertisers who wish to advertise on answers 
com  and we often facilitate such requests 
direct ads represented an immaterial portion of our total revenue 
licensing revenue 
we earn a negligible portion of our revenues from partners that pay us for providing them with our answer based services that they then use in their own products  via co branded web pages 
costs and expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of compensation  travel and overhead costs relating to personnel who are engaged in production operations  content editing and integration  fees to third parties to license and translate content  data center costs  including depreciation of information technology assets  web search service fees  ad serving fees  amortization of the cost of acquired software used in our products  and contractual revenue sharing fees to various web property operators for visitors directed to our web properties  or traffic acquisition costs 
we expect our cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  to increase in because of the various initiatives we are planning  including translation of significantly more english language content into foreign languages 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of compensation  travel and overhead costs of personnel conducting research and development of our products and services  and consulting costs 
our research and development team works primarily on projects to improve and enhance product functionality  quality  performance  scalability  user interface  and monetization 
in the long term  we expect that our research and development expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue 
however  since we expect to grow our research and development team significantly in  we expect our research and development expenses  as a percentage of revenue  to increase in community development  sales and marketing expenses community development  sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation  travel and overhead costs of personnel in charge of developing and encouraging the wikianswers community of users asking and answering questions and volunteer supervisors  sales and marketing  product management  marketing and market information services  public relations and promotional costs 
as a result of our termination of direct ad sales in  we expect that the primary future growth in this expense line item will be in the area of wikianswers community development 
in the long term we expect that our community development  sales and marketing expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue  however we may not experience that improvement in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  travel and overhead costs for general executive  financial  legal  human resources  and other administrative personnel  professional services  including investor relations  legal  accounting  payroll and other consulting services  insurance fees  amortization of domain names  and other general corporate expenses 
we generally expect that our general and administrative expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue 
overhead costs overhead costs consist primarily of rent  telecommunications  utilities and depreciation expenses 
stock based compensation new employees typically receive stock option awards within three months of their start date 
we also grant additional stock option awards to existing employees and directors 
we account for stock based awards under accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period awards are expected to vest 
costs resulting from stock based compensation are part of our compensation expense and are included in the operating expense categories in our statements of operations 

table of contents impact of foreign currency fluctuations the dollar cost of our operations is heavily influenced by changes in the value of the dollar in relation to the new israeli shekel nis  mostly due to the nis based salaries of our israel based employees 
close to half of our operating expenses  excluding non cash items such as stock based compensation  are denominated in new israel shekels 
we enter into forward contracts to hedge some of our nis based expenses 
prior to may  these derivatives were not designated as hedging instruments under the rules of asc  derivatives and hedging  and therefore  the net gains losses arising from these derivatives were recognized in operating expenses as they occurred 
starting may  we designated all of our currency hedging activity as cash flow hedges as they were all eligible 
thus  the change in those hedges are recorded as other comprehensive income loss  and are reclassified to earnings as the forward contracts mature or if  and to the extent that the hedging relationship is deemed ineffective 
in  compensation  excluding stock based compensation thereafter  cash based compensation  to employees amounted to  thousand compared to  thousand during the same period in  a net increase of thousand 
as a result of the strengthening of the dollar as compared to the nis and the effect of foreign currency derivatives  cash based compensation in declined approximately thousand as compared to  however  such decline was offset by other compensation changes  including increases in headcount and raises  amounting to thousand 
our period over period discussion regarding operating expenses includes the impact of foreign currency on such expenses 
we expect our nis based expenses in  to be in excess of levels  thus  if the dollar continues to fluctuate as compared to the nis  we will experience further fluctuation in the dollar amount of our nis based expenses 
termination fees and write off of cost relating to the terminated lexico acquisition and abandoned follow on offering in the first quarter of  our planned acquisition of lexico publishing group llc and the related planned offering of securities were terminated due to unfavorable market conditions 
as a result  we recorded a charge to our statement of operations  amounting to approximately million 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  is comprised of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest expense on capital leases  transaction costs we incurred in connection with the issuance of the series b warrants in june and amortization of deferred costs we incurred in connection with the issuance of the series b unit warrant  in june other income  net other income  net  is comprised of foreign currency gains and losses 
loss resulting from fair value adjustment of warrants the series a warrants  the series b warrants and the series b unit warrant prior to exercise  which are components of transactions with redpoint omega  lp and redpoint omega associates  llc collectively  redpoint are revalued each reporting date 
any change to their fair value is recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations 
background regarding the transaction with redpoint follows 
redpoint financings on june   pursuant to a private placement of our securities  redpoint purchased million of our series a convertible preferred stock  shares  convertible into  shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  along with common stock purchase warrants exercisable for  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share series a warrants 
in conjunction therewith  redpoint also received a warrant  referred to as the series b unit warrant  exercisable until june   to purchase units of up to million of series b convertible preferred stock  shares and common stock purchase warrants exercisable for  shares of common stock series b warrants 
the series b convertible preferred stock is initially convertible into  shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the series b warrants have an exercise price of per share 
on june   redpoint exercised the series b unit warrant  in full 

table of contents after deducting placement agent fees and legal expenses  our net proceeds from the private placement  in june  were million  while our net proceeds from the exercise of the series b unit warrant  in june  were million 
the transaction that took place on june  is referred to as the series a financing 
the transaction that took place on june  is referred to as the series b financing 
the two transactions  in aggregate  are collectively referred to as the redpoint financings 
the series a convertible preferred stock  the series b convertible preferred stock  the series a warrants and the series b warrants are collectively referred to as the redpoint securities 
the series a convertible preferred stock has the rights and preferences set forth in our certificate of designations  number  voting powers  preferences and rights of series a convertible preferred stock  which  as of its date of filing on june   amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
the series b convertible preferred stock has the rights and preferences set forth in the company s certificate of designations  which amended the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation on june  for a detailed description of the rights and preferences of the series a convertible preferred stock and the series b convertible preferred stock  we refer you to the notes to the financial statements contained in this annual report 
in connection with the redpoint financings  redpoint received and exercised their right to appoint two individuals to serve as voting members of our board of directors 
in connection with the redpoint financings we entered into a registration rights agreement with redpoint  pursuant to which we agreed to register with the sec for resale the common stock underlying the redpoint securities 
in connection with the registration rights agreement  we agreed to pay a penalty of per month  on a daily pro rata basis  up to a maximum of  of the aggregate purchase price  as partial liquidated damages  for certain default events and subject to certain circumstances 
the partial liquidated damages may trigger if the registration statements covering the series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock  which we filed on july  and june   respectively  and which were declared effective by the sec on september  and july   respectively  cease to remain continuously effective 
income tax benefit expense  net our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate primarily due to differences between income and expense recognition prescribed by income tax regulations and generally accepted accounting principles 
we utilize different methods and useful lives for depreciating and amortizing property  equipment and intangible assets and different methods and timing for certain expenses 
furthermore  permanent differences arise from certain income and expense items recorded for financial reporting purposes but not recognizable for income tax purposes  and from certain income and expense items recorded for income tax purposes financial but not recognizable for reporting purposes 
in addition  our income tax expense has been adjusted for the effect of state and local taxes and foreign income from our wholly owned subsidiary 
at december   our deferred tax assets were almost entirely offset by a valuation allowance 
despite the fact that we had income in  we experienced a cumulative loss in recent years and view this as a significant piece of negative evidence that makes it difficult to support a conclusion that expected taxable income from future operations justifies recognition of deferred tax assets 
our israeli subsidiary had net income in and  resulting from services we received from the israeli subsidiary 
the israeli subsidiary charges us for research development it provides us  plus a profit margin  currently 
however  the subsidiary operates primarily through plans recognized as approved enterprises and a beneficiary enterprise as later amended in amendment no 
to the investment law under israeli law  which means that income arising from the subsidiary s approved research development activities  is subject to zero percent tax under the alternative benefit path for a period of ten years 
currently  the subsidiary operates under two separate approved enterprise plans  ending december  and december   respectively  and a beneficiary enterprise plan ending december  after the close of the first approved enterprise plan in  the subsidiary will have to pay taxes at the regular corporate income tax rate on the relative proportion of taxable income attributable to the first approved enterprise plan 
additionally  the israeli subsidiary provides answers corporation with certain management services plus a profit margin  currently 
income derived from such services are taxable at the israeli corporate tax rate in effect at the time and in and  respectively 
in the event of distributions by our israeli subsidiary to answers corporation  the israeli subsidiary would have to pay a corporate tax on the amount distributed  and answers corporation would have to pay a tax to be withheld at source on the amounts of such distributions received 
furthermore  answers corporation would be subject to a federal tax on dividends received  before applying any credits possibly allowed for nol carryforwards or by the income tax treaty between the united states and israel 
at present  we do not plan on having the subsidiary distribute a dividend to answers corporation 

table of contents results of operations year ended december change in thousands wikianswers advertising revenue referenceanswers advertising revenue licensing revenue revenue revenue increased  thousand  or  from  thousand for the year ended december  to  thousand for the year ended december  wikianswers advertising revenue in increased  thousand  or  compared to the preceding year  due to increases in traffic  offset to some extent by decreased rpm 
wikianswers average daily page views in the year ended december  were  an increase of compared to the average daily page views of  in we believe that the traffic growth that wikianswers has experienced in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the dynamics of the property 
as our database of questions and answers grows  we draw new traffic  primarily from seo  which in turn results in the creation of new questions and answers  or new content  which in turn drives additional growth 
the growth in revenue from the aforesaid traffic growth was partially offset by a decrease in our rpm 
the average wikianswers rpm in the year ended december  was  a decrease of compared to the average rpm of in google adsense comprised of our wikianswers ad revenue in  thus  the decrease in rpm resulted mostly from a decrease in the rpm we earn from google adsense 
we believe the decline in google adsense rpm may be attributed to any of a number of possible factors  or a combination of several such factors  including  changes we made to the site  changes that google may have made to the adsense algorithm that connects advertisers and publishers and changes in how advertisers may have managed their advertising costs in response to uncertain economic conditions 
referenceanswers advertising revenue in decreased thousand  or  compared to the preceding year  due to lower rpm 
referenceanswers rpm in the year ended december  was  a decrease of  compared to the rpm of in we attribute the decline mostly due to the elimination of direct ad sales in the third quarter of unlike wikianswers  the referenceanswers google rpm did not decline in  as compared to  notwithstanding our belief that the possible factors discussed above with respect to the google adsense rpm on wikianswers are the same factors that may have played a role in determining referenceanswers google adsense rpm 
referenceanswers average daily page views in were  which approximates our average daily page views of  in as described in further detail above  in september  we announced the launch of the new answers 
com  in recognition of our integration of wikianswers and referenceanswers 
the product strategy guiding such integration was our desire to give users a common address for the best answers to all types of questions be they community generated from wikianswers  or editorially licensed from referenceanswers 
in september  we took our final step in this integration by creating a new unified answers 
com home page and login  integrating features from both properties  and making other changes in our user interface to strengthen our positioning as having one dominant product and brand  answers 
com  comprised by two properties  wikianswers and referenceanswers 
since the new unified answers 
com home page was designed to give prominence to wikianswers and to encourage users to enter their questions into the site s query bar  beginning september  visits to that page  which on average approximate  per day  are being recorded as a wikianswers page view rather than a referenceanswers page view  contrary to the previous practice 
traffic and revenue trends the following table illustrates the historical trends of our two web properties revenues  average daily page views and rpms  by quarter  beginning the first quarter of 
table of contents q q q q q q q q ad revenue in thousands wikianswers referenceanswers total wikianswers referenceanswers total traffic average daily page views wikianswers referenceanswers total wikianswers referenceanswers total rpm wikianswers referenceanswers traffic trends the traffic and rpm trend discussion that follows pertains to our answers 
com english site and not the figs sites that are currently in their infancy and are immaterial 
since we purchased wikianswers in november  the web property has grown significantly  both in terms of traffic and revenue 
we believe that the growth that wikianswers has experienced is primarily due to the dynamics of the property 
as our database of questions and answers grows  we draw new traffic  primarily from seo  which in turn results in the creation of new questions and answers  or new content  which drives additional growth 
this is a self reinforcing growth model that we consider a virtuous cycle of growth 
notwithstanding this cycle of growth  wikianswers growth has  over time decelerated  and we believe that  as wikianswers grows further and gets larger  its rate of growth will decelerate further 
in addition  the integration of our two web properties may further decelerate the growth of wikianswers as compared to past periods 
beginning the third quarter of  when we experienced a drop in our traffic to referenceanswers due to a search engine algorithm adjustment by google  through the first quarter of  referenceanswers average daily page views in every quarter has declined  compared to the same quarter in the immediately preceding year 
in the second and third quarters of  referenceanswers average daily page views were and higher  respectively  than the average daily page views for the same periods in however  referenceanswers experienced traffic declines in the months of september and october  as compared to the same months in finally  in the fourth quarter of  referenceanswers stopped receiving traffic from the google definition link 
we are presently not able to identify a predictable traffic trend for this property 
rpm trends as noted earlier  of our revenue was earned via google adsense 
since we are not planning to change this dependence anytime in the near future  our rpm will largely be a function of the revenue we earn from google adsense 
we renewed our gsa in october  extending the agreement through january  at financial terms that are slightly less favorable than the terms we had for the two year period ending january   therefore we expect a slightly lower google adsense rpm 
further  we believe that there are many other factors  any one of which or a combination thereof  that may impact our google adsense revenue  including changes we make to the site  positioning of ads  the geographic mix of our traffic  the growing percentage of returning visitors and changes that google may make to the algorithm that connects advertisers and publishers 
in addition  advertisers may lower or increase their bids for keywords in response to how much they are able to make per paid click 
as a result of the multiple possible factors  many of which are not in our control  we cannot predict whether the rpm declines we saw in will continue in 
table of contents costs and expenses cost of revenue year ended december change in thousands cost of revenue cost of revenue increased thousand  or  from  thousand in  to  thousand in 
the change in cost of revenue was due primarily to an increase of thousand in compensation costs  excluding stock based compensation  and an increase of thousand in content licensing costs 
additionally  in we started translating wikianswers into four languages  which resulted in translation expenses of thousand  an expense we did not incur in the aforesaid increases were partially offset by decreases of thousand in stock based compensation  and thousand in amortization expense from intangible technology assets we purchased in connection with the brainboost acquisition that took place in december as we wrote off the brainboost answer engine on may   there was no amortization recorded subsequent to such date 
research and development expenses year ended december change in thousands research and development research and development expenses increased thousand  or  from  thousand in  to  thousand in the change in research and development expenses was due primarily to an increase of thousand in compensation related expenses  excluding stock based compensation  and increases in travel and overhead of thousand and thousand  respectively 
such increases were offset  to some extent  by a decrease in stock based compensation of thousand 
community development  sales and marketing expenses year ended december change in thousands community development  sales and marketing community development  sales and marketing expenses decreased thousand  or  from  thousand in  to  thousand  in the primary factor that caused this decrease was that compensation related expenses  excluding stock based compensation  decreased thousand  and stock based compensation decreased thousand  mostly due to the termination of our direct ad sales team in the second and third quarters of at the end of the second quarter of we decided to abandon direct ad sales  and terminated most of our direct ad sales staff 
further  as a result of such decision we recorded a net charge of thousand  in  to account for the termination of certain service contracts relating to our abandoned direct ad sales efforts 
finally  there was also a decrease of thousand in overhead expenses in as compared to the aforesaid decreases were partially offset by increases in costs relating to promotion and marketing  including wikianswers community events  of thousand  and increases in consulting and other services of thousand 

table of contents general and administrative expenses year ended december change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased thousand  or  from  thousand in  to  thousand in the change in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the following factors compensation costs  excluding stock based compensation  increased by thousand  travel and conference expenses increased by thousand  consulting fees increased by thousand and non income related taxes increased by thousand 
the aforesaid increases were partially offset by decreases of thousand in accounting and legal fees  thousand in stock based compensation  and thousand in overhead expenses 
write off of the brainboost answer engine year ended december change in thousands write off of the brainboost answer engine as a result of our decision to effectively abandon our use of the brainboost answer engine  the net book value of the brainboost answer engine  as of may   in the amount of  thousand  was written off and the resulting charge was included in our statement of operations for termination fees and write off of costs relating to the terminated lexico acquisition and abandoned follow on offering year ended december change in thousands termination fees and write off of costs relating to the terminated lexico acquisition and abandoned follow on offering in we recorded a charge of  thousand for various costs and fees we incurred in connection with the terminated acquisition of lexico and the abandoned follow on offering of securities 
interest expense  net year ended december change in thousands interest expense  net interest expense  net  rose thousand  from thousand expense  net  in  to thousand expense  net  in the change in interest expense  net  resulted mostly from the following matters firstly  in  we recorded thousand of amortization relating to thousand of transaction costs that we incurred in connection with the series b unit warrant in june  while in  such amortization amounted to thousand 
secondly  in  we recorded a thousand charge relating to the series b warrants transaction costs we incurred in june finally  interest earned from our cash balance in was thousand  compared to thousand in the reduction in interest income earned on our cash balances was the result of lower short term interest rates 

table of contents other income  net year ended december change in thousands other income  net other income  net  declined thousand  from thousand in  to thousand  net  in other income  net  results from foreign currency net gains and losses 
loss resulting from fair value adjustments of warrants year ended december change in thousands loss resulting from fair value adjustment of warrants the series a warrants and series b warrants are revalued each reporting date  and any change to their fair value is recorded in the statement of operations 
the warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants was  up to its exercise in june  also revalued each reporting period and the change in its fair value was recorded in the statement of operations 
the primary reason for the change in value of the aforesaid warrants is the market price of our common stock on the measurement dates 
an increase in the price of our common stock increases the value of the warrants and thus results in a loss on our statement of operations 
conversely  a decline in the price of our common stock decreases the value of the warrants and thus results in a gain on our statement of operations 
income tax benefit expense  net year ended december change in thousands income tax benefit expense  net income tax benefit expense  net  changed by thousand  from to the tax benefit for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the recognition of thousand of tax benefits relating to closed tax years  which was partially offset by israeli income taxes amounting to approximately thousand 
the tax expense for the year ended december  was primarily the result of thousand related to estimated income taxes for us federal  state and local  and israeli income taxes  partially offset by thousand of net deferred tax assets recorded by the subsidiary 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million at december  the federal nols will expire if not utilized on various dates from through section of the internal revenue code of section generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of nol carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income where a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership 
we estimate two ownership changes  as defined under section  have occurred  that would trigger this limitation 
based on our current estimates and assumptions  we may currently use approximately million of our accumulated nols 
the remaining approximate million nol is available to offset taxable income in an amount of approximately million per year 
any unused portion of the million is available for use in future years until such nol is scheduled to expire 
the subsidiary has capital loss carryforwards of approximately thousand  which can be applied to future capital gains for an unlimited period of time under current tax rules 
we file us federal  various state and local and foreign income tax returns

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of liquidity were our cash inflows from revenues and funds that were raised through various financing events that took place through june beginning the last quarter of  our principal source of liquidity has been our cash inflows from operations  and we expect that going forward  cash flow from operations will continue to be our principal source of liquidity 
notwithstanding  as a result of redpoint s exercise of their series b unit warrant in june  we received an additional infusion of funds in the amount of million before transaction costs

most of our capital expenditures resulted from the establishment of our second colocation facility 
we expect capital expenditures in will continue to grow as we continue to invest in various areas including our existing colocation facilities and office facilities 
financing activities net cash flow from financing activities in and were mostly the result of the redpoint financings  less dividends paid to redpoint 
future operations based on our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and expected cash flow from operations  we believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet our working capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents we assess acquisition opportunities as they arise 
financing in excess of our current cash and cash equivalents may be required if we decide to make additional acquisitions 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such opportunities may arise  or that any such acquisitions may be consummated 
additional financing may not be available on satisfactory terms when required 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
as a result of the redpoint financings in june and june  we raised net proceeds of approximately million  significantly improving our cash position 
the series a and series b preferred stock contain redemption provisions which allow the holders of a majority of the series a and series b preferred stock to request redemption  at any time on or after june   of all or any part of their stock 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   there were no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with asc  business combinations formerly sfas  and for goodwill and other identifiable definite and indefinite lived acquired intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
additionally  we review our long lived assets for recoverability in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment formerly sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the identification and valuation of intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition are based on various valuation methodologies including reviews of projected future cash flows 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
further  changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments thereby impacting the fair value of these assets  which could result in an impairment of the goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we evaluate our long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment in accordance with asc  with the annual goodwill impairment testing date set at september further  in accordance with asc and asc  we also evaluate our long lived tangible and intangible assets  respectively  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
while we use available information to prepare our estimates and to perform impairment evaluations  the completion of annual impairment tests requires significant management judgments and estimates 
as of december   we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill and that there were no events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of our intangible and other long lived assets may not be recoverable  therefore  there was no need to evaluate the recoverability or compute impairment of any of the aforesaid assets 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based awards under asc  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas r  share based payment  which requires measurement of compensation cost for stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period awards are expected to vest 
the estimation of stock based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider various factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 

table of contents we determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the black scholes valuation model  which requires significant assumptions regarding the expected stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate and the dividend yield  and the estimated period of time option grants will be outstanding before they are ultimately exercised 
we estimate our expected stock volatility based on our own historical stock volatility rates 
had we made different assumptions about our stock price volatility or the estimated time option and warrant grants will be outstanding before they are ultimately exercised  the related stock based compensation expense  and our net income loss and net earnings loss per share amounts could have been significantly different  in and accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have fully offset our us net deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
despite the fact that we had income in  we experienced a cumulative loss in recent years and view this as a significant piece of negative evidence that makes it difficult to support a conclusion that expected taxable income from future operations justifies recognition of deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  prescribes how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
additionally  for tax positions to qualify for deferred tax benefit recognition under asc  the position must have at least a more likely than not chance of being sustained upon challenge by the respective taxing authorities  and whether or not it means that criteria is a matter if significant judgment 
we have not provided us and israeli income taxes and withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our israeli subsidiary as of december  because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the us as of december   the cumulative amount of earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided is approximately million 
we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary are permanently reinvested 
while  to date  we have concluded that such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances may change in the future 
changes in facts and circumstances may include a change in the estimated capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  or a change in our corporate liquidity requirements 
such changes could result in our management determining that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in that event  we would be required to recognize income tax liabilities on the assumption that our foreign undistributed earnings will be distributed to the us accounting for redpoint financings in accounting for the series a financing  the proceeds were first allocated to the series b unit warrant  which was classified as a current liability  based on its fair value  and the residual amount was allocated among the series a convertible preferred stock and the series a warrants based on their relative fair values  all in accordance with the guidance in asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity formerly sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  asc  derivatives and hedging formerly sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and asc  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity formerly eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the series b unit warrant has been revalued at each reporting date  since its inception until it was exercised on june  the series a convertible preferred stock has been classified as temporary equity  in accordance with the guidance in asc sa formerly eitf d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities  and  prior to january   the series a warrants were classified in permanent equity 

table of contents in june  the fasb ratified the consensus of eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock incorporated in asc 
asc responded to practice questions about whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to the reporting company s own stock by establishing a framework for the determinations and by nullifying some previous requirements 
the adoption of asc s requirements affects issuers accounting for warrants and many convertible instruments with provisions that protect holders from declines in the stock price down round provisions 
warrants with such provisions are no longer recorded in equity  and many convertible instruments with such provisions require bifurcation with the conversion option separately accounted for as a derivative under asc as a result of asc  effective january   and due to the down round protection of the series a warrants  such warrants are separately accounted for as a derivative under asc and are no longer recorded in equity but rather as a liability to be revalued at each reporting date 
on june   redpoint exercised  in full  the series b unit warrant  which was valued at approximately million on such date  thus extinguishing this liability from the company s balance sheet through a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
in accounting for the series b financing  the proceeds were first allocated to the series b warrants which were classified as a liability  based on its fair value  and the residual amount was allocated to the series b convertible preferred stock  all in accordance with the guidance in asc  asc and asc the series b convertible preferred stock has been classified as temporary equity  in accordance with the guidance in asc sa 
we used various valuation models and techniques to determine the individual values of the various components in the redpoint financings  including monte carlo and black scholes 
inputs used in the models include our stock price and risk free interest rate 
additionally  significant assumptions used in applying these techniques included redemption behavior estimates including likelihood of forced conversion  and timing of liquidation event if such event transpires and expected volatility of our stock price 
while we believe we applied appropriate judgment in the aforesaid assumptions  variations in judgment could have materially affected the valuation results  and thus  our financial statements 
we continue to use the black scholes valuation model in our periodic fair value adjustments 
the series a convertible preferred stock and the series b convertible preferred stock issued as part of the redpoint financings contain an embedded conversion option which could potentially require separate accounting under asc according to asc formerly paragraph a of sfas  in order to determine whether separate accounting is required  one has to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the conversion option are closely related to the host contract  and the nature of the host contract 
we exercised judgment and evaluated this matter in accordance with asc formerly eitf topic d  determining the nature of a host contract related to a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share under fasb statement no 
asc conveys the sec staff s views on determining whether the characteristics of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or equity 
in evaluating an embedded derivative feature for separation under asc  the consideration of the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract should not ignore the stated or implied substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial instrument 
we considered various factors including redemption provisions  stated rate  voting rights  whether returns are discretionary or mandatory  collateral requirements  participation in residual earnings and liquidation preferences  in making our determination that the host contract was more akin to equity 
the most important factor that led us to the conclusion that the host contract was more akin to equity was the fact that the redemption feature was not mandatory or likely to occur 
had we determined that the host contract was more akin to debt and not equity it would have impacted the accounting for the host contract and the embedded conversion option and could have had a material impact on our financial statements

we use adjusted ebitda as an additional measure of our overall performance for purposes of business decision making  developing budgets and managing expenditures 
it is useful because it removes the impact of our capital structure interest expense and gain loss resulting from fair value adjustment of series a warrants  series b warrants and warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants  asset base amortization and depreciation  stock based compensation expenses  taxes  foreign currency exchange rate differences and certain non recurring expenses from our results of operations 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors in their analysis of our results of operations for reasons similar to the reasons why we find it useful and because these measures enhance their overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects of our ongoing business operations 
by reporting adjusted ebitda  we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current  past and future periods  and peer companies in our industry 

table of contents more specifically  we believe that removing these impacts is important for several reasons amortization of intangible assets 
adjusted ebitda disregards amortization of intangible assets 
specifically  we exclude a amortization  and the write off  of acquired technology from the acquisition of brainboost technology  llc  developer of the brainboost answer engine in december  and b amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of wikianswers and other related assets in november these acquisitions resulted in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred 
we believe that excluding such expenses is significant to investors  due to the fact that they derive from prior acquisition decisions and are not necessarily indicative of future cash operating costs 
in addition  we believe that the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations 
while we exclude the aforesaid expenses from adjusted ebitda we do not exclude revenues derived as a result of such acquisitions 
the amount of revenue that resulted from the acquisition of wikianswers and other related assets is disclosed in the revenue discussion of this item the amount of revenue that resulted from the acquisition of technology from brainboost is not quantifiable due to the nature of its integration 
stock based compensation expense 
adjusted ebitda disregards expenses associated with stock based compensation  a non cash expense arising from the grant of stock based awards to employees and directors 
we believe that  because of the variety of equity awards used by companies  the varying methodologies for determining stock based compensation expense  and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations  excluding stock based compensation from adjusted ebitda enhances the ability of management and investors to compare financial results over multiple periods 
depreciation  interest  gain loss resulting from fair value adjustment of series a warrants  series b warrants and warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants  taxes and exchange rate differences 
we believe that  excluding these items from the adjusted ebitda measure provides investors with additional information to measure our performance  by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  asset composition  and tax positions 
terminated lexico acquisition and follow on offering 
adjusted ebitda disregards  thousand in costs associated with our terminated acquisition of lexico and the cancellation of our follow on offering 
we believe that  excluding these costs provides investors with additional information to measure our performance  by excluding events that are of a non recurring nature 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of liquidity or financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
investors are cautioned that there are inherent limitations associated with the use of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are non gaap financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles  many of the adjustments to adjusted ebitda reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future  other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than us  thus limiting its usefulness as a comparative tool  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the periodic costs of certain tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business  adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest income from our investments in cash and investment securities  adjusted ebitda does not reflect foreign exchange net gains and losses  adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense and other cost relating to financing our business  including gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustment of redpoint venture s series a warrants  series b warrants and their warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants  adjusted ebitda excludes taxes  which are an integral cost of doing business  and because adjusted ebitda does not include stock based compensation  it does not reflect the cost of granting employees equity awards  a key factor in management s ability to hire and retain employees

we plan to invest in our core platform and product extensions in the core platform is answers 
com in english  comprised of wikianswers and referenceanswers 
we will continue to invest resources in our core platform in areas such as content quality  maintaining and improving search engine optimization  performance  scalability  and usability 
in particular  we see content quality as the single biggest opportunity and challenge of wikianswers 
to date  the essential driving force behind the growth of traffic continues to be the expansion of our database of questions and answers 
content quality plays a crucial role in our search engine rankings  as well as user experience 
this fundamental relationship drives our product and community directions 
there are four product extension areas that we have already begun or are planning 
in the third quarter of we launched our french  italian  german and spanish  or figs  language versions of wikianswers 
in we plan to continue our investment in the figs versions of wikianswers 
our strategy will capitalize on the needs of users around the globe who are searching for answers online and will leverage our core strengths community building and q a space 
we plan on leveraging our large and dynamic english language database to grow our foreign language versions  by selectively translating some of the million answered questions we have in our wikianswers english language database 
our largest competitor already has successful international sites and receives much of its traffic from those sites  thus we view this area as critical to our future growth 
the other three product extensions we are planning in are in the realm of mobile  social media and video 
users are not always in front of a desktop or laptop when they need answers  and market research  as well as recent announcements by apple  google  rim and others  point to the expected growth of handheld internet access devices 
we think that mobile answers 
com access could add usage  greater engagement  and brand recognition 
in terms of connecting more aggressively to social media  we ve already taken the first step  in the form of our facebook connect solution announced in january users can now log into answers 
com using their facebook  twitter  yahoo or google identity 
our goal is to further address the social answers space by more tightly integrating the question answering process with popular social networks 
lastly  video is another natural extension of our web based text solution  and we intend to enter this space to enrich the types of answers we serve our user base 
none of the four product extensions we are planning to begin in are likely to produce significant amounts of revenue in
