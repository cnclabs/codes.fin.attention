our forward looking statements are based upon our judgment and assumptions as of the date such statements are made concerning future developments and events  many of which are outside of our control 
these forward looking statements  and the assumptions upon which such statements are based  are inherently speculative and are subject to uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations may include  without limitation  our ability to i identify customers with marine transportation needs requiring specialized vessels or operating techniques  ii secure financing on satisfactory terms to acquire  modify  or construct vessels if such financing is necessary to service the potent ial needs of current or future customers  iii obtain new contracts or renew existing contracts which would employ certain of our vessels or other assets upon the expiration of contracts currently in place  on favorable economic terms  iv manage the amount and rate of growth of our general and administrative expenses and costs associated with operating certain of our vessels  v and manage our growth in terms of implementing internal controls and information systems and hiring or retaining key personnel  among other things  and vi effectively handle our substantial leverage by servicing and meeting the covenant requirements in each of our debt instruments  thereby avoiding any defaults under those instruments and avoiding cross defaults under others 
other factors include i changes in cargo  charterhire  fuel  and vessel utilization rates  ii the rate at which competitors add or scrap vessels in the markets as well as demolition scrap prices and the availability of scrap facilities in which we operate  iii changes in interest rates which could increase or decrease the amount of interest we incur on borrowings with variable rates of interest  the availability and cost of capital to us  and the exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  iv the impact on our financial statements of nonrecurring accounting charges that may result from our ongoing evaluation of business strategies  asset valuations  and organizational structures  v changes in accounting policies and practices ado pted voluntarily or as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  vi changes in laws and regulations such as those related to government assistance programs and tax rates  vii the frequency and severity of claims against us  and unanticipated outcomes of current or possible future legal proceedings  viii unexpected out of service days on our vessels  whether due to unplanned maintenance  piracy or other causes  ix the ability of customers to fulfill obligations with us  x the performance of unconsolidated subsidiaries  and xi other economic  competitive  governmental  and technological factors which may affect our operations

critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments or estimates and entail material uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to our rail ferry service segment voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
our voyage expenses are estimated at the beginning of the voyages based on historical actual costs or from industry sources familiar with those types of charges 
as the voyage progresses  these estimated costs are revised with actual charges and timely adjustments are made 
the expenses are ratably expensed over the voyage based on the number of days in progress at the end of the period 
we believe there is no material difference between recording estimated expenses ratably over the voyage versus recording expenses as incurred 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require no estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets 
various methods are used to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our depreciable assets 
due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
because drydocking charges can be material in any one period  we believe that the acceptable deferred method provides a better matching for the amortization of those costs over future revenue periods benefiting from the drydocking of our vessel 
we capitalize only those costs that are incurred to meet regulatory requirements or upgrades  or that add economic life to the vessel 
normal repairs  whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not  are expensed as incurred 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc topic previously sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
however  pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain of our foreign operations are subject to us income taxes when those earnings are repatriated to the us we intend to permanently re invest  and  of our and foreign earni ngs  respectively  and accordingly  have not provided deferred taxes in the amount of  and  against those earnings 
the jobs creation act  which first applied to us on january   changed the united states tax treatment of the foreign operations of our us flag vessels and our international flag shipping operations 
we made an election under the jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under a tonnage tax rather than under the usual us corporate income tax regime 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc topic previously interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income tax an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as of december   our deferred tax liability was million  a decrease of million from the same period in the deferred tax liability has been effectively reduced as a result of our tax policy that could potentially result in the establishment of valuation allowances as early as the first quarter of the net effect of this position would result in a higher effective tax rate during the reserves would allow the company to recover these benefits at a later time 
self retention insurance as explained further in note d to the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report  we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish self insurance provisions for hull and machinery and loss of hire for each policy year based on our estimates of eventual claims settlement cost 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estimated potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  his torical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we believe that insurance and the indemnification of a previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will partially mitigate our exposure 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant s employment history with the company 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
derivative instruments and hedging activities under asc topic previously sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  in order to consider a derivative instrument as a hedge  i we must designate the instrument as a hedge of future transactions  and ii the instrument must reduce our exposure to the applicable risk 
if the above criteria are not met  we must record the fair market value of the instrument at the end of each period and recognize the related gain or loss through earnings 
if the instrument qualifies as a hedge  net settlements under the agreement are recognized as an adjustment to earnings  while changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recorded through stockholders investment in other comprehensive income loss 
we currently employ  or have employed in the recent past  interest rate swap agreements  foreign currency contracts  and commodity swap contracts see note n fair value of financial instruments and derivatives on page f 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by asc topic previously sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and asc topic previously sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historic al experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
in september of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc topic previously sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
this statement requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under sfas no 
 actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the measurement date  th e date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured  is required to be the company s fiscal year end 

table of contents executive summary overview of overall strategy the company operates a diversified fleet of us and international flag vessels that provide international and domestic maritime transportation services to customers primarily under medium to long term contracts 
our business strategy consists of identifying growth opportunities as market needs change  utilizing our extensive experience to meet those needs  and continuing to maintain a diverse portfolio of medium to long term contracts  under which we can serve our long standing customer base by providing quality transportation services 
financial discipline strong balance sheet we continued to improve our financial position in operating cash flow increased from million in to million in working capital current assets less current liabilities of million

long term debt to equity ratio of for as compared to for consolidated financial performance we continued to improve on prior year performance with overall net income results for at million  which included million in impairment losses and losses on the sale of vessels  as compared to million for  which included a million gain on sale of a vessel 
this was supported by improvements in our time charter and contract of affreightment segments  offset partially by a decline in our rail ferry segment 
the increased carriage of supplemental cargoes on our us flag pctc s was the primary factor behind the improved results 
consolidated gross voyage profit grew from million for the full year to million for the full year administrative expenses increased by million year on year partially as a result of recognizing a  accrued contingent liability associated with incentives received from various alabama agencies to relocate our corporate headquarters

contract of affreightment coa increase in gross profit of  year on year 
rail ferry overall decrease in gross profit of million primarily due to a drop in northbound volumes and lower margins 
major northbound customer stopped shipments in late continued strong southbound volumes 
other net income from unconsolidated entities decreased from million  which included an after tax gain on the sale of a panamax bulk carrier of million in  to million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  time charter rail ferry all amounts in thousands contracts coa service other total revenues from external customers voyage expenses vessel depreciation impairment loss gross voyage profit loss revenues from external customers voyage expenses vessel depreciation gross voyage profit the changes of revenue and expenses associated with each of our segments are discussed within the gross voyage analysis below 
time charter contracts the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in is primarily due to an increase in the carriage of supplemental cargoes on our us flag pure car truck carriers 
revenues for the segment increased from million in to million in as a direct result of the increase in supplemental cargoes 
partially offsetting this increase in gross voyage profit is an impairment loss of million recognized in the second quarter on one of our international flag container vessels 
contract of affreightment the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was primarily due to lower fuel costs in  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues due to contractually scheduled freight rate adjustment 
rail ferry service gross voyage results for this segment decreased from a profit of million in to a loss of million in  while revenues decreased from million in to million in the current weak conditions continue to have a negative impact especially with the northbound service 
in december  we were notified by one if its major northbound customers of their intention to discontinue using the service effective immediately sighting a sourcing decision as their reason for the change 
this loss represents approximately of total revenue for this segment 
the company continues to work on its marketing strategy and its plan to increase northbound volumes 
see risk factors other gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to  in this decrease was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses related to our unconsolidated interest in an entity in mexico  an exchange loss on the yen denominated facility revaluation adjustment and a favorable earnings adjustment for one of our owned investees  which increased gross profit and were recorded in other income and expenses administrative and general expenses a g increased from million in to million in a substantial portion of this increase was due to the expansion of our executive stock compensation program initiated in april and accrual of a contingent liability associated with incentives received from various alabama agencies 
the following table shows the significant a g components for the twelve months ending december  and respectively all amounts in thousands year ended december  a g account variance wages and benefits executive stock compensation professional services office building expense other consulting fees total fees associated with unaffiliated company s offer to purchase the company 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower principal balances 
results from our investments decreased from  of income in to a loss of  in included in these amounts are recognized impairment losses of  in the fourth quarter of and  in the first three quarters of on the company s investment in marketable securities 
these charges reflect investments in certain equity securities whose market values had been materially impacted by current economic conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our stock portfolio and recognized a gain of approximately  on the sale  which is reported as a separate line item under interest and other on the income statement 
income taxes for  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities  reflecting tax losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate 
for  our benefit was  on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities 
our tax benefit increased from the comparable prior year primarily as a result of lower results of the company s us flag coal carrier and rail ferry segments  which are subject to the higher corporate statutory rate 
as a result of the recent losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate  we are unable to rely on projections of future taxable income in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets associated with such operations 
accordingly  the realizability of such deferred tax assets has been assessed based on the future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities  which were sufficient to support the realization of the deferred tax assets as of december  however  if we continue to generate losses from these operations  we may need to establish a valuation allowance against the portion of the deferred tax assets not realizable through future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities 
the establishment of a valuation allowance would have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and futur e changes to be valuation allowance would impact the effective tax rate 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  decreased from million in to million in the results were driven by our investment in dry bulk cape holding ltd dry bulk  which owns of subsidiary companies currently owning one panamax size bulk carrier  two capesize bulk carriers and having two handymax bulk carrier newbuildings on order for delivery in dry bulk contributed million in as compared to million in the results included a gain on the sale of one of dry bulk s subsidiaries vessels  a panamax bulk carrier  of approximately million in june

time charter contracts the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was due to an increase in the carriage of supplemental cargoes on our us flag pure car truck carriers 
revenues for the segment increased from million in to million in this improvement in revenues is the result of the aforementioned increase in supplemental cargoes and operating one additional international flag pure car truck carrier for the full year as compared to approximately half of contract of affreightment the decrease in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with operating the segment s vessel under an operating lease in the vessel  which was fully depreciated for tax purposes  was sold in the benefits derived under an operating lease are reflected in a lower net effective tax rate 
the increase in revenue from million in to million in was due to increased voyages and freight rate escalation for increasing fuel costs in rail ferry service gross voyage results for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a profit of million in this increase was due to additional sailings in as well as increased cargo volumes which were carried as a result of the addition of second decks on each rail ferry vessel 
operation of the vessels with the second decks began in the third quarter of revenues for this segment increased from million in to million in due to the additional sailings and increased cargo volumes utilizing second deck capacity 
other gross voyage profit for this segment increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to adjusted earnings recorded in for dry bulk 
other income and expenses administrative and general expenses a g increased from million in to million in a substantial portion of this increase was due to fees related to charges associated with advisory and legal costs resulting from an unaffiliated shipping company s unsolicited conditional offer to purchase the company s outstanding shares  employee relocation expenses associated with the move of the company s headquarters to mobile  alabama  and stock compensation expense for stock grants awarded to executive officers 
the following table shows the significant a g components for the twelve months ending december  and respectively all amounts in thousands year ended december  a g account variance wages and benefits executive stock compensation professional services office building expense consulting fees relocation other total interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to the retirement of all the remaining outstanding obligations of our senior unsecured notes notes in october of we recognized an impairment loss of  on the company s investment in marketable securities in the fourth quarter of the charge reflects investments in certain equity securities whose market values were materially impacted by current economic conditions 
investment income decreased from million in to  in the decrease was primarily due to a lower rate of return on our short term investments 
income taxes for  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities  reflecting tax losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate 
for  our benefit was million on our million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities 
our tax benefit decreased from the comparable prior year primarily as a result of improved earnings from our rail ferry segment which are taxed at the statutory rate 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  increased from million in to million in the improved results came from our investment in dry bulk cape holding ltd dry bulk  which owns of subsidiary companies currently owning two capesize bulk carriers and one panamax bulk carrier  which contributed million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a gain on the sale of one of dry bulk s subsidiaries vessels  a panamax bulk carrier  of approximately million in june during the second quarter of  dry bulk s subsidiary companies entered into ship purchase agreements with mitsui co 
of japan for two newbuildings handymax bulk carriers to be delivered in the first half of total investment in the newbuildings is anticipated to be approximately million  of which the company s share would be or approximately million

 discontinued operations in the third quarter of  we elected to discontinue our international lash service by the end of during the first two months of  we sold the one remaining lash vessel and the majority of lash barges  with the remaining lash barges under contract to be sold by the end of the first quarter of the after tax gain of million recorded in reflects a gain of million on the sale of two lash vessels and million on the sale of lash barges 
the after tax gain of million recorded in reflects the gain from the sale of one lash vessel and remaining lash barges 
during there were no revenues associated with the discontinued lash services  as compared to million for profit from operations befor e taxes were  in  compared to a million loss in our us flag lash service and international lash service were reported in continuing operations as a part of our liner segment in periods prior to june  the financial results for all periods presented have been restated to remove the effects of both of those operations from continuing operations 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities decreased from million at december   to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased during by million to a total of million 
this decrease was due to cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million being offset by cash used by investing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
approximately million of this debt is offset in current assets as the current portion of a direct finance leas e on a pctc we purchased in during  operating activities generated positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation and amortization 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for was generated after adjusting for non cash items such as a million impairment loss on one of our international flag container vessels  amortization of deferred charges  a non cash deduction of million from the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  and deferred drydocking payments of million 
during  we received cash dividends of million from the normal operations of our unconsolidated entities 
cash used by investing activities of million for included capital outlays of million and the purchase of short term corporate bonds of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of million and principal payments received under direct financing leases of million 
included in the million of capital payments is million for the purchase of the two vessels used in an indonesian mining service  subsequently sold to a third party under an installment sale described further below 
additionally  we made equity payments of million paid toward the construction of three new handy size double hull drybulk carriers  and million in installment payments toward the construction of a pure car truck carrier to be delivered in march cash provided by financing activities of million for included regularly scheduled debt payments of million and cash dividends paid of million  partially offset by proceeds from new debt of million  including a million loan relating to the purchase of the two vessels previously mentioned to be used in an indonesian mining service 
we entered into a financing agreement with regions bank on august  for a five year facility to finance up to million for the purchase of additional vessels 
as of december   the company has drawn million under this facility towards the purchase of the vessels to fulfill the additional requirements under the indonesian mining contract 
the vessels purchased with the loan proceeds were subsequently sold to a third party in the third quarter of  generating a deferred gain of approximately million 
in addition to a million payment received from the buyer  a ten year note receivable was agreed to for the remaining balance 
we hold a first mortgage covering the vessels until the note is fully satisfied 
due to our financing of the transaction  the gain realized on the sale was deferred 
this defer ral will be recognized over ten years  the length of the agreement with the buyer 
with this financing  our unsecured revolving line of credit was reduced from million to million  expiring in april of as of december   million of this revolving credit facility was pledged as collateral for letters of credit  and the remaining million was available 
in  we acquired a built pctc  which we reflagged to us flag 
the vessel was financed with a three year yen denominated note with a balloon payment of billion yen due on september  immediately after being delivered to us in september of  we chartered this vessel through august of to a far east based shipping company  which held an option to purchase the vessel at the end of the contract 
the charter was based on yen capital hire payments which correspond with our yen debt payments 
on february   the charterer notified us of their intention not to exercise their option to purchase the vessel and subsequently negotiated a mutually acceptable redelivery of the vessel effective february  on march  we entered into a us denominated bridge loan which converted our total outstanding debt of billion yen to approximately million usd 
we intend to replace the bridge loan with long term financing by september of as a result of the redelivery of the vessel in february  we will reclassify approximately million of net investment in direct financing leases from current assets to vessels in the first quarter of this reclassification will result in a decrease in our working capital of million  however  the debt associated with this vessel will continue to be classified as a current liability since the debt matures in september if we are unable to refinance the debt of million by the end of the second quarter of through replacement of the bridge loan with long term financing  our working capital position will be negatively impacted  which could result in a working capital deficit and potential violation of the working capital covenant included in most of our credit agreements 
alt ernatively  the debt could be partially or completely refinanced on a long term basis by draws on our revolving credit agreement provided we extend the term of that agreement beyond its current maturity date of april we fully expect to extend the revolving credit agreement beyond its maturity date 
we routinely evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional vessels or businesses 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions 
we generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement 
we may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions  the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations 
stock repurchase program on january   the company s board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to a total of  shares of the company s common stock 
we expect that any share repurchases under this plan will generally be made from time to time for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices 
the timing and amount of any purchases under the program will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors 
through december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
no shares were repurchased in unless and until the board otherwise provides  this new authorization will remain open indefinitely or until we reach the  share limit 
debt and lease obligations as of december   we held five vessels under operating contracts  five vessels under bareboat charter or lease agreements and five vessels under time charter agreements 
the types of vessels held under these agreements include four pure car truck carriers  three breakbulk multi purpose vessels  three roll on roll off vessels  three container vessels and a tanker vessel  all of which operate in our time charter segment  and a molten sulphur carrier operating in our contracts of affreightment segment 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities 
we entered into a new lease agreement on our singapore office which became effective october  the length of the lease is five years with an option to renew for a further period of three years 
the agreement calls for total annual payments of approximately  for all five years 
the rent expense  along with the associated leasehold improvements are being amortized using the straight line method over the lease term 
debt covenants in the unanticipated event that our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital  enter into financings of our unencumbered vessels or restructure debt 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity despite the current disruption of the capital and credit markets and can continue to fund working capital and capital investment liquidity needs through cash flow from operations 
to the extent we are required to seek additional capital  our efforts could be hampered by the recent turmoil in the credit markets 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report 
we presently have variable to f ixed interest rate swaps on of our long term debt 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following is a summary of the scheduled maturities by period of our debt and lease obligations that were outstanding as of december  debt and lease obligations s total thereafter long term debt including current maturities interest payments operating leases vessel commitments total by period approximately million of the million long term debt obligation in  is related to a balloon payment on financing of our pctc vessel purchased in we intend to replace all or part of this balloon payment with long term financing in the above contractual obligations table does not include our approximate million obligation to the alabama state port authority related to the terminal upgrades in mobile  al  to be paid by us over the ten year terminal lease 
this long term obligation  reported in other long term liabilities  will be met by the usage fees paid by our rail ferry vessels in the mobile port

table of contents current economic and market issues the economic crisis that affected globally commercial activity  including ourselves  in a number of areas during the previous year continues at the current time 
while previously we found banking institutions severely tightening their lending standards or even eliminating access to credit for new projects  we have found change in the posture of those institutions indicating a willingness to review new credit proposals 
while the financial marketplace is not ready to fully extend credit under a number of circumstances  we have found potential financing avenues 
we have maintained for a number of years banking relationships with financially solid institutions 
based on information currently available to us  we believe these institutions remain stable 
while the exact effects of the crisis to our customers is not fully known  we have not suffered from the nonpayment of freights or charterhires being earned in the ordinary course of business 
we continue to review the status of our customers and are ready to take appropriate actions to reduce potential exposures should the occasion arise 
while we have been fortunate in our ability to avoid potential hardships from the nonpayment of freights  we cannot provide you with assurance that this will continue 
for more information  see item a  risk factors 
during the year ended  the financial markets recovered a large portion of the dramatic fall seen during the year 
by maintaining our asset allocation within our stated policy guidelines with targets of equities and fixed instruments  the pension plan also participated in the recovery 
while as of december  we continue to show an underfunded status in other comprehensive income  we have exceeded our required funding obligations under the current pension protection act 
we expect to contribute  for fiscal year for more information  see note e  employee benefit plans 
restructuring of liner services and disposition of certain lash assets the board of directors approved in the fourth quarter of to dispose of certain lash liner service assets 
the decision was based on the belief that we could generate substantial cash flow and profit on the disposition of the assets  while improving our future operating results 
accordingly  we sold our lash feeder vessel and barges in the first quarter of in the second quarter of we sold our one remaining us flag lash vessel and lash barges 
in the third quarter of  the company elected to discontinue its international lash service by the end of during the first quarter of  we sold the one remaining lash vessel and the remainder of our l ash barges 
the pre tax gain of million recorded in reflects a gain of million on the sale of the lash feeder vessel and liner vessel  and million on the sale of lash barges 
the gain of million recorded in reflects the gain from the sale of one lash vessel and remaining lash barges 
during  we generated no revenues from our lash services  compared to million for profit from operations before taxes were  in  compared to a million loss in our us flag lash service and international lash service were reported in continuing operations as a part of our liner segment in periods prior to june  financial information for all periods presented has been restated to remove the effects of those operations from continuing operations 
rail ferry service expansion this service provides a unique combination of rail and water ferry service between the us gulf coast and mexico 
the relatively low operating profit margin generated by this service makes higher cargo volumes necessary to achieve meaningful levels of cash flow and profitability 
the capacity of the vessels operating in our rail ferry service defines the maximum revenues and  in turn  the cash flow and gross profits that can be generated by the service 
accordingly we made investments in that essentially doubled the capacity of the service including the construction of second decks on each of the ships as well as construction of new terminals in mobile  alabama and an upgraded terminal in coatzacoalcos  mexico 
these capital investments hav e permitted us to expand our cargo volume and reduce our cost per unit of cargo carried 
we completed construction of the second decks in mid at a total cost of approximately million  which we paid in full through december  the utilization of the second deck capacity is directly related to the terminal upgrades in mobile  al and coatzacoalcos  mexico 
both terminal upgrades were substantially completed in july and became operational at that time 
the total cost of the mobile terminal was approximately million  of which million was funded by a grant from the state of alabama 
the remaining million was financed by the alabama state docks and will be repaid over the ten year terminal lease 
our share of the cost of the improvements to the terminal in mexico was approximately million 
we have a interest in the company that owns the terminal in mexico  and of the advances to that company for our share of the cost of the terminal are accounted for as capital contributions with the remaining accounted for as a loan to that company 
as of december   the cost of our total investment in a joint venture that owns a trans loading and storage facility rti  which was used to support the rail ferry service in new orleans  included an equity investment in unconsolidated entities of million and an outstanding loan of approximately million due from our partner in the venture 
as a result of our terminal operations moving from new orleans to mobile  an impairment test to determine our loss exposure on this facility was required 
as of december   no impairment was recorded as we expect to recover our total investment 
our terminal lease with the port of new orleans was terminated during the second quarter of  when we transitioned to the mobile terminal 
as of june   we wrote off both the cost of the new orleans terminal of million  funded by the state and city  which was recorded as a leasehold improvement  and the reimbursements to us from the state and the city of million that were recorded as deferred credits  resulting in no effect on net income 
our investment in the new orleans terminal was funded with the proceeds from a new market tax credit nmtc financing agreement 
under the nmtc financing  the lender has the ability to utilize certain tax credits associated with profitable operations at that location 
with the relocation of the operations to mobile  alabama  the lender amended the original application to the federal agency that oversees the nmtc issuance to include the mobile terminal as eligible property for the usage of the tax credits 
bulk carriers in november  we contracted with a korean shipyard to construct three double hull handy size bulk carrier newbuildings with scheduled deliveries in early we made equity payments of million in the fourth quarter on these vessels 
we have a interest in dry bulk  which owns of subsidiary companies which own one panamax size bulk carrier and two cape size bulk carriers 
this investment is accounted for under the equity method and our share of earnings or losses are reported in our consolidated statements of income net of taxes 
dry bulk s subsidiary companies have entered into ship purchase agreements with a japanese company for two handymax bulk carrier newbuildings  scheduled to be delivered in total investment in the newbuildings is anticipated to be approximately million  of which our share would be or approximately million 
during the period of construction up to delivery  where of the projected overall costs will be expended  dry bulk plans to finance the interim construction costs with equity contributions of up to with the balance of the cost being financed with a bank financed construction loan 
due to the financial market conditions  it is possible that additional equity contributions may be required 
while it is anticipated that any required equity contributions will be covered by dry bulk s subsidiary companies earnings  if they are not  our anticipated share of these interim equity contributions could be approximately million  of which we have already funded  upon completion and delivery  dry bulk plans to establish permanent long term financing

our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities increased from million at december   to million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased during by million to a total of million 
this increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million  and cash provided by investing activities of million  offset by cash used by financing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
operating activities generated positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation  amortization and gains on sales of assets and investments

currently we are evaluating our options to increase our line of credit and expect tighter bank restrictions due to the overall condition of the credit markets

at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions 
we generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement 
we may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions  the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations 
liquidity the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities increased from million at december   to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased during by million to a total of million 
this decrease was primarily due to the retirement of all the remaining outstanding obligations of our senior unsecured notes notes in october of of million  cash used by other financing activities of million  and cash used for investing activities of million  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million r elated to current maturities of long term debt 
operating activities generated positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation  amortization and gains on sales of assets and investments 
cash provided by operating activities of million for also included a decrease in accounts receivable of million primarily due to the timing of collections of receivables from the msc and us department of transportation  offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
also included was million of cash used to cover payments for vessel drydocking costs in  offset by cash distributions of million received from our investments in unconsolidated entities

the vessel was purchased with financing and subsequently chartered to a third party under a financing lease arrangement 
this noncash transaction is not reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts  and in the past we have also utilized commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december  is not material due to the fact of our outstanding debt is fixed by interest rate swap contracts 
we have entered into ten interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  two in september of  one in november of  two in september of  one in november of  one in january  one in february and two in december in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
for each of these agreements  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates  and our weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is a liability of million  with the offsetting charge of million net of taxes in other comprehensive income 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in an million liability 
commodity price risk as of december   we do not have commodity swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to price risk related to the purchase of the estimated fuel requirements for our rail ferry service segment 
we have fuel surcharges in place for our rail ferry service  which we expect to effectively manage the price risk for those services during revenue from fuel surcharges in for the rail ferry service was million 
if we had commodity swap agreements  they could be structured to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices 
however  they would also lim it the benefit we might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity 
a increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately  in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding decrease of approximately in our basic earnings per share based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  the additional fuel costs assumes no additional revenue was generated from fuel surcharges  however  we believe that some or all of the price increase could have been passed on to our customers through the aforementioned fuel surcharges during the same period but might have been limited by our need to maintain competitive rates 
our charterers in the time charter segment are responsible for purchasing vessel fuel requirements  thus  we have no fuel price risk in this segment 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase commitments during these contracts mature on various dates during the fair value of these contracts at december   is an asset of  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates would be an asset of  for further information on our foreign currency contracts  see note n fair value of financial instruments 
on january   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into a senior secured term loan facility denominated in japanese yen for the purchase of a ceu newbuilding pctc under construction and currently scheduled for final delivery in march we received verbal notification the banking institution would be exercising their option to reduce the yen financing on this vessel from to of delivered cost 
the facility will now finance up to yen  towards the overall purchase price of the vessel 
under current accounting guidelines  since this facility is not denominated under our functional currency  the outstanding balance of the facility as of the end of each reporting period is to be revalued with any adjustments recorded to earnings 
due to the amount of the facility  we may sustain fluctuations that may cause material swings in our reported results 
as an example  a hypothe tical increase or decrease on the exchange rate between the yen and us dollar would impact earnings by approximately  for the reporting period 
while we believe that these fluctuations will smooth out over time  any particular reporting period could be materially impacted by these adjustments 
the company intends to continue to monitor its risk profile for this facility and potentially enter into foreign currency derivative instruments that may aid in offsetting these fluctuations 
the third quarter negative adjustment related to this revaluation was  based on the draw on the total facility and a decrease in the exchange rate 
the fourth quarter adjustment was a positive  on the subsequent increase of the exchange rate from the prior period
