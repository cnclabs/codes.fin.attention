the long term impact of the welding fume loss contingency  in the aggregate  on operating results  operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess  particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co defendants and insurance carriers 
moreover  the company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims and indemnity payments have been immaterial 
if cost sharing dissipates for some currently unforeseen reason  or the company s trial experience changes overall  it is possible on a longer term basis that the cost of resolving this loss contingency could materially reduce the company s operating results  cash flows and restrict capital market access

in june  the fasb issued asc formerly fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
asc determined that unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities  and thus  should be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share 
this standard did not have a significant impact on the company s disclosure of earnings per share

this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company adopted these provisions as of january   applying the presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively resulting in reclassification of noncontrolling interests from other non current liabilities to total equity

the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu no 
 but does not expect it will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used 
if warranted  these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated 
historically  the company s estimates have been determined to be reasonable 
no material changes to the company s accounting policies were made during the company believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
legal and tax contingencies the company  like other manufacturers  is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
such claims and litigation include  without limitation  product liability claims and health  safety and environmental claims  some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos and manganese induced illnesses 
the costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs  which are recognized in the periods incurred 
insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and  where reimbursements are probable  they are recognized in the applicable period 
with respect to costs other than defense costs ie  for liability and or settlement or other resolution  reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs  after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience 
if an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable  or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation 
many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant  which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions  will vary greatly 
therefore  in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made 
reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change 
moreover  reserves only cover identified and or asserted claims 
future claims could  therefore  give rise to increases to such reserves 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements and the legal proceedings section of this annual report on form k for further discussion of legal contingencies 
the company is subject to taxation from us federal  state  municipal and international jurisdictions 
the calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment 
the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published 
the company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions 
exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation 
exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures  however  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries which are deemed permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings 
deferred income taxes of have been provided on earnings of  that are not expected to be permanently reinvested 
at december   the company had approximately  of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carryforwards which may reduce taxable income in future years 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
at december   a valuation allowance of  was recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the company s assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes 
pensions the company maintains a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees 
these plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa  local statutory law or as determined by the board of directors 
the plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation 
pension plans are funded except for a domestic non qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relates to its defined benefit plan in the united states 
the fair value of plan assets is determined at december of each year 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
at the end of each year  the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan s portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets 
the asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation  interest rates and equity market performance 
the company determined this rate to be and for its us plans at december  and  respectively 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan 
the amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense 
during  investment returns in the company s us pension plans were compared with a decline of in a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately  another significant element in determining the company s pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities 
to develop the discount rate assumption to be used  the company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non callable bonds rated aa or better 
the company determined this rate to be for its us plans at december  a basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately  pension expense relating to the company s defined benefit plans was   and  in  and  respectively 
the company expects pension expense to decrease by approximately  to  the company made voluntary contributions to its us defined benefit plans of   and  in  and  respectively 
the company expects to voluntarily contribute  to its us plans in based on current pension funding rules  the company does not anticipate that contributions to the plans would be required in inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs 
for most domestic inventories  cost is determined principally by the last in  first out lifo method  and for non us inventories  cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the valuation of lifo inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time 
the excess of current cost over lifo cost amounted to  at december  and  at december  the company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management  and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  write downs of inventory values and adjustments to cost of sales may be required 
historically  the company s reserves have approximated actual experience 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered 
the company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable  knowledge of the financial condition of customers  review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future  additional allowances may be required 
historically  the company s reserves have approximated actual experience 
long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
goodwill and intangibles the company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment 
the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value 
fair values are determined using established business valuation multiples and models developed by the company which incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows  future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods 
goodwill allocated to the harris products group reporting unit at december  was  the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded carrying value by as of the testing date during the fourth quarter of key assumptions in estimating the reporting unit s fair value include assumed market participant assumptions of revenue growth  operating margins and the rate used to discount future cash flows 
actual revenue growth and operating margins below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate would have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit that could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
the company manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at december   a change in commodity prices  and a basis point increase in effective interest rates under the company s current borrowing arrangements 
the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at december  were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange  commodity price  or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on income before taxes  interest expense  or accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the analysis takes into consideration any offset that would result from changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability 
foreign currency exchange risk the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
at december   the company hedged certain third party and intercompany purchases and sales 
at december   the company had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately  at december   a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
commodity price risk from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods the prices the company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates 
a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices on the company s open commodity futures at december  would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
interest rate risk as of december  the company had no interest rate swaps outstanding 
the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents at december  approximated carrying value 
the company s financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk 
the company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in high quality instruments 
the company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations
