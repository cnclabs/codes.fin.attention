item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the company we are one of the world s largest meat protein companies and the second largest food production company in the fortune with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry 
we produce  distribute and market chicken  beef  pork  prepared foods and related allied products 
our operations are conducted in four segments chicken  beef  pork and prepared foods 
some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products  the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace  accessibility of international markets  market prices for our products  the cost of live cattle and hogs  raw materials and grain  and operating efficiencies of our facilities 
overview general we had improved operating results in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as a result of improved internal performance and a better market environment 
the following are a few of the key drivers we achieved margin management gains and operational efficiency improvements  which were the key drivers that led to the nearly billion improvement in operating income  excluding the impact of the million beef segment goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal margin management improvements occurred in the areas of mix  export sales  price optimization and value added products initiatives 
the operational efficiencies occurred in the areas of yields  cost reduction  labor management  logistics cost optimization  capacity and live bird operations including livability  feed conversion  and net to processing improvements 
tyson and the meat industry in general have benefitted from improving domestic market conditions 
for the first time in years  industry forecasters predict a reduction in available protein in two consecutive years for this is a factor of reduced protein production  fewer imports  increased exports and reduced freezer inventories 
poor industry results for and led to a reduction in industry capacity and a better balance between overall meat products supply and demand 
while the recent economic conditions have caused decreased demand at foodservice establishments  most of the lost demand has shifted to retailers as consumers are choosing to eat at home 
as a result of improving domestic market conditions and our own operational efficiency and margin management improvements  our operating margins were in fiscal after removing million of insurance proceeds received during the year and million related to the goodwill impairment 
this is the first time since the acquisition of ibp  inc 
in that annual operating margins have exceeded 
the following is a summary of operating margins by segment chicken or excluding million of insurance proceeds received and million related to a goodwill impairment beef pork prepared foods debt and liquidity during fiscal  we generated billion of operating cash flows 
we used these cash flows  as well as restricted cash  to repurchase  retire or redeem million of senior notes 
as a result  our total debt is billion  the lowest level since the acquisition of ibp  inc 
at october   we had billion of liquidity  which includes the availability under our credit facility and million of cash and cash equivalents 
our accounting cycle resulted in a week year for both fiscal and and a week year for fiscal 
table of contents in millions  except per share data net income loss attributable to tyson net income loss attributable to tyson per diluted share net income included the following items million in charges related to losses on notes repurchased during fiscal  million non cash  non tax deductible charge related to a full goodwill impairment in an immaterial chicken segment reporting unit  million non cash  non tax deductible charge related to the impairment of an equity method investment  and million gain from insurance proceeds 
net loss included the following items million non cash  non tax deductible charge related to a goodwill impairment in our beef segment  and million charge related to the closing of our ponca city  oklahoma  processed meats plant

fiscal outlook in  overall protein chicken  beef  pork and turkey production is expected to increase 
because exports are likely to grow as well  we forecast that total domestic availability of protein should be relatively flat compared to the following is a summary of the fiscal outlook for each of our segments  as well as an outlook on capital expenditures  net interest expense and debt chicken while we expect chicken production to increase  domestic availability will depend on export volumes 
because of the less than expected yields in global feed grain crop production  current futures prices indicate higher grain costs in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect to offset the impact of increased grain costs with operational and pricing improvements 
beef we expect to see a gradual reduction in cattle supplies of in fiscal  however  we do not expect a significant change in the fundamentals of our beef business as it relates to the previous few quarters 
we expect adequate supplies in the regions we operate our plants 
we expect beef exports to remain strong in fiscal pork we expect hog supplies in fiscal will be comparable to fiscal and we believe we will have adequate supplies in the regions in which we operate 
we expect pork exports to remain strong in fiscal prepared foods we expect operational improvements and increased pricing will more than offset the likely increase in raw material costs in fiscal while many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter term in nature  we are typically able to absorb rising input costs 
however  there is a lag time for price increases to take effect  so it is more difficult to absorb rapidly rising raw material costs 
capital expenditures our preliminary capital expenditures plan for fiscal is approximately million 
net interest expense we expect fiscal net interest expense will be approximately million  down nearly million compared to fiscal debt we will continue to use our available cash to repurchase notes when available at attractive rates 
we do not have any significant maturities of debt coming due over the next three fiscal years  as our notes due october  notes balance was million at october  we plan to retire these notes with current cash on hand and or cash flows from operations

our notes may be converted early during any fiscal quarter in the event our class a stock trades at or above for at least trading days during a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter 
in this event  the note holders may require us to pay outstanding principal in cash  which totaled million at october  any conversion premium would be paid in shares of class a stock 
the conditions for early conversion were not met in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal  and thus  the notes may not be converted in our first quarter fiscal should the conditions for early conversion be satisfied in future quarters  and the holders exercised their early conversion option  we would use current cash on hand and cash flow from operations for principal payments 
at october   we had million of notes outstanding 
we plan presently to use current cash on hand and cash flows from operations for payment on the remaining notes due on october  our current ratio was to and to at october   and october   respectively 
deterioration of credit and capital markets credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal and although they have improved  they have not returned to pre levels 
several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures 
while not all inclusive  the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business credit facility cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures 
we also have a revolving credit facility  with a committed maximum capacity of billion  to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs  letters of credit  and as a source of financing for growth opportunities 
as of october   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  none of which were drawn upon  which left million available for borrowing 
our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of banks  with commitments ranging from million to million per bank 
the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements 
if any of the banks in the syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility  our liquidity could be impaired  which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs  support letters of credit or finance our growth opportunities 
customers suppliers the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions 
although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or non performance by suppliers  current market conditions increase the probability we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults 
should credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the united states and abroad  demand for protein products could be reduced  which could result in a reduction of sales  operating income and cash flows 
in addition  we rely on livestock producers throughout the country to supply our live cattle and hogs 
if these producers are adversely impacted by the current economic conditions and terminate their production  our livestock supply for processing could be significantly impacted 

table of contents additionally  we have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate 
under these programs  we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices 
the amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest 
participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost  or upon termination of the agreement 
our maximum obligation associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier s net tangible assets 
although we believe the aggregate maximum obligation under the program is unlikely to ever be reached  the potential maximum obligation as of october   was approximately million 
the total receivables under these programs were million and million at october  and october   respectively 
even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock suppliers  we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers assets 
after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions  we have recorded an allowance for these programs estimated uncollectible receivables of million and million at october   and october   respectively 
investments the value of our investments in equity and debt securities  including our marketable debt securities  company owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets  are impacted by market volatility 
these instruments were recorded at fair value as of october  we did not have a significant change in fair value of these instruments during fiscal we currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans 
all three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants 
based on our actuarial valuation  we anticipate contributions of million to these plans for fiscal we also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan 
based on our actuarial valuation  we anticipate contributions of million to this plan in fiscal financial instruments as part of our commodity risk management activities  we use derivative financial instruments  primarily futures and options  to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases 
similar to the capital markets  the commodities markets have been volatile over the past few years 
grain and some energy prices remain volatile after reaching an all time high during our fourth quarter of fiscal before falling sharply 
while the reduction in grain and energy prices benefit us long term  we recorded losses related to these financial instruments in fiscal of million 
we have implemented policies to reduce our earnings volatility associated with mark to market derivative activities  including more use of normal physical purchases and normal physical sales which are not required to be marked to market 
insurance we rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims  property damage and various other risks 
our primary insurers maintain an am best financial strength rating of a or better 
nevertheless  we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment
