item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical and or occupational therapy clinics that provide preventative and post operative care for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries  treatment for neurologically related injuries and rehabilitation of injured workers 
the first oa center opened in june in october  we acquired a interest in rehab management group rmg which provides physicians and their patients with clinical services including electro diagnostic analysis edx as well as intra articular joint iajp direct and lumbar osteoarthritis lop direct programs 
effective november   we acquired a interest in an outpatient rehabilitation practice with four clinics in san antonio  tx san antonio acquisition  and effective june   we acquired a interest in a multi partner outpatient rehabilitation practice with nine clinics located in the mid atlantic region mid atlantic acquisition 
in both cases  the existing partners retained a interest 
effective january   we acquired a physical therapy practice located in michigan 
the results of operations of the acquired clinics have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the effective date of their acquisition 
at december   we operated clinics in states 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
of the clinics  we developed of the clinics and acquired in  we developed clinics and closed in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with third party facilities under management as of december  in december  the fasb issued guidance which established new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest formerly referred to as minority interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this guidance requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent entity s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to a noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
this guidance clarified that changes in a parent entity s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent entity retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this guidance required that a parent entity recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
this guidance also included expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent entity and its noncontrolling interest 
we adopted this guidance effective january  in accordance with this guidance  we no longer record an intangible asset when the purchase price of a noncontrolling interest exceeds the book value at the time of purchase 
any excess or shortfall will be recognized as an adjustment to additional paid in capital 
during the year ended december   additional paid in capital was adjusted for million  net  related to purchases of noncontrolling interests in excess of book value 
additionally  operating losses are allocated to noncontrolling interests even when such allocation creates a deficit balance for the noncontrolling interest partner 
for  the net operating losses allocated to noncontrolling interest had the effect of increasing net income attributable to our common shareholders by  net of taxes  and reducing the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest by  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
net patient revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from insurance companies  third party payors  patients and others for services rendered 
the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at contracted amounts 
table of contents different from its established rates 
the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments is based on terms of payor contracts and historical collection and write off experience 
contractual allowances 
contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such services 
medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided in our clinics 
we estimate contractual allowances based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations  payor contracts and historical calculations 
each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic based on payor contracts and the historical collection experience of the clinic and applies an appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor of the clinic 
based on our historical experience  calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage at the payor level is sufficient to allow us to provide the necessary detail and accuracy with our collectibility estimates 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
payor terms are periodically revised necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimates made by management 
our billing system may not capture the exact change in our contractual allowance reserve estimate from period to period 
therefore  in order to assess the accuracy of our revenues and hence our contractual allowance reserves  our management regularly compares its cash collections to corresponding net revenues measured both in the aggregate and on a clinic by clinic basis 
in the aggregate  the historical difference between net revenues and corresponding cash collections has generally reflected a difference within approximately of net revenues 
additionally  analysis of subsequent period s contractual write offs on a payor basis reflects a difference within approximately between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage as compared to the estimated contractual allowance reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance 
as a result  we believe that a reasonable likely change in the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not likely be more than at december  for purposes of demonstrating the sensitivity of this estimate on the company s financial condition  a one percent increase or decrease in our aggregate contractual allowance reserve percentage would decrease or increase  respectively  net patient revenue by approximately  for the year ended december  management believes the changes in the estimate of the contractual allowance reserve for the periods ended december   and have not been material to the statement of operations 
the following table sets forth information regarding our patient accounts receivable as of the dates indicated in thousands december  gross accounts receivable less contractual allowances subtotal accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts net patient accounts receivable 
table of contents the following table presents our patient accounts receivable aging by payor class as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  current to current to payor days days total days days total managed care commercial plans medicare medicaid workers compensation self pay other totals workers compensation is paid by state administrators or their designated agents 
other includes primarily litigation claims and  to a lesser extent  vehicular insurance claims 
reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
for a more complete description of our third party revenue sources  see business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each clinic 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experience with particular payors to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have a large number of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus  require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts is regularly reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount to be recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company does not believe that it has any significant uncertain tax positions at december   nor is this expected to change within the next twelve months due to the settlement and expiration of statutes of limitation 
the company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits nor was any interest expense recognized during the twelve months ended december  and carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
the accounting standards require that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 

table of contents goodwill 
the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and upon the occurrence of certain events  and are written down to fair value if considered impaired 
the company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on at least an annual basis in its third quarter by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit including related goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
a reporting unit refers to the acquired interest of a single clinic or group of clinics 
local management typically continues to manage the acquired clinic or group of clinics 
for each clinic or group of clinics  the company maintains discrete financial information and both corporate and local management regularly review the operating results 
for each purchase of the equity interest  goodwill and other intangible assets  if any  with indefinite lives are assigned to the respective clinic or group of clinics  if deemed appropriate 
if the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives exceeds the estimated fair value  we are required to allocate the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  as if we had just acquired it in a business combination 
we then write down the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to the implied fair value 
any such write down is included as an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of net income 
judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
we may use quoted market prices  prices for similar assets  present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates 
in addition  we may obtain independent appraisals in certain circumstances 
we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to apply these valuation techniques 
irrespective of our valuation analysis  future market conditions may deteriorate 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
in  the evaluation of goodwill yielded an impairment charge of  on a clinic purchased in the evaluation of goodwill in did not result in any goodwill amounts that were deemed permanently impaired

at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  however  the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility was  at december  compared to  at december  although the start up costs associated with opening new clinics and our planned capital expenditures are significant  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries  clinic closure costs accrued  future clinic development and investments through at least december significant acquisitions would likely require financing under our revolving credit facility 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  were million in a money market fund 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million from december  to december  was due primarily to million used by investing and financing activities offset by funds provided by operations of million

effective august   we entered into a credit agreement with a commitment for a million revolving credit facility which was increased to million effective june  credit agreement 

table of contents effective march   we amended the credit agreement to permit the company to purchase up to  of its common stock subject to compliance with certain covenants  including the requirement that after giving effect to any stock purchase  our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement be less than to and that any stock repurchased be retired within seven days of purchase 
in addition  the credit agreement was amended to adjust the pricing grid which is based on our consolidated leverage ratio with the applicable spread over libor ranging from to 
the credit agreement has a four year term maturing august   is unsecured and includes standard financial covenants 
proceeds from the credit agreement may be used for acquisitions  working capital  purchases of our common stock  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
fees under the credit agreement include a closing fee of 
and an unused commitment fee ranging from 
to 
depending on our consolidated leverage ratio and the amount of funds outstanding under the credit agreement 
on december   the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was million leaving million in availability and we were in compliance with all of the covenants thereunder 
historically  we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and to cover operational needs 
we generally develop new clinics rather than acquire them  which requires less capital 
we plan to continue developing new clinics and making additional acquisitions in selected markets 
we have from time to time purchased the noncontrolling interests of limited partners in our clinic partnerships 
we may purchase additional noncontrolling interests in the future 
generally  any acquisition or purchase of noncontrolling interests is expected to be accomplished using a combination of cash and financing 
any large acquisition would likely require financing 
we make reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect accounts receivable  including applicable deductible and co payment amounts  in a consistent manner for all payor types 
claims are submitted to payors daily  weekly or monthly in accordance with our policy or payor s requirements 
when possible  we submit our claims electronically 
the collection process is time consuming and typically involves the submission of claims to multiple payors whose payment of claims may be dependent upon the payment of another payor 
claims under litigation and vehicular incidents can take a year or longer to collect 
medicare and other payor claims relating to new clinics awaiting medicare rehab agency status approval initially may not be submitted for six months or more 
when all reasonable internal collection efforts have been exhausted  accounts are written off prior to sending them to outside collection firms 
with managed care  commercial health plans and self pay payor type receivables  the write off generally occurs after the account receivable has been outstanding for days

at december   we accrued  additional consideration related to this acquisition upon achievement of the predefined operating results for the year ended december  and such amount was recorded as goodwill 
this amount was paid in march except for rmg  in conjunction with the above mentioned acquisitions  in the event that a limited minority partner s employment ceases at any time after three years from the acquisition date  we have agreed to repurchase that individual s noncontrolling interest at a predetermined multiple of earnings before interest and taxes 
from september through december   the board authorized us to purchase  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  up to  shares of our common stock  however  the terms of our revolving credit facility had prohibited such purchases since august as of december   there were approximately  shares remaining that could be purchased under these programs 
in march  the board authorized the repurchase of up to or approximately  shares of our common stock march authorization 
in connection with the march authorization  we amended 
table of contents our revolving credit facility to permit the share repurchases 
we are required to retire shares purchased under the march authorization 
since there is no expiration date for these share repurchase programs  additional shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or private transactions depending on price  availability and our cash position 
during  we purchased  shares for an aggregate price of million 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases for its executive offices and clinic facilities discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
factors affecting future results clinic development as of december   we had clinics in operation of which were opened in during  we expect to incur initial operating losses from new clinics opened in late generally  we experience losses during the initial period of a new clinic s operation 
operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than for more seasoned clinics because of start up costs and lower patient visits and revenues 
generally  patient visits and revenues gradually increase in the first year of operation  as patients and referral sources become aware of the new clinic 
revenues typically continue to increase during the two to three years following the first anniversary of a clinic opening 
current economic conditions the current economic environment may have material adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we cannot predict 
unemployment has remained high while business and consumer confidence is relatively low 
the economic environment could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
for example patients visits may decline due to higher levels of unemployment or reduced discretionary spending  the tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables  or our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital for our business  including for acquisitions
