item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with  and we qualify our discussion in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere within this annual report on form k  the material contained under part  item description of business and part i  item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k  and the cautionary disclosure about forward looking statements at the front of part i of this of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative  proprietary products for the treatment of voiding dysfunctions 
our primary focus is on two products the urgent pc system  which we believe is the only fda approved minimally invasive  office based neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of urinary urgency  urinary frequency  and urge incontinence symptoms often associated with overactive bladder oab  and macroplastique  a urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence primarily due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency isd 
outside of the us  our urgent pc is also approved for treatment of fecal incontinence  and macroplastique is also approved for treatment of male stress incontinence and vesicoureteral reflux our sales growth during fiscal and was largely attributable to rapid market acceptance of our urgent pc product in the us however  our sales performance in the us was impacted by the american medical association s ama advice to the medical community  during our first fiscal quarter of  that the previously recommended unique  listed cpt code for reimbursement for urgent pc treatments be replaced with an unlisted code 
as a result  some third party insurers are delaying or denying reimbursement while certain other insurers are reassessing their coverage and reimbursement policies for urgent pc treatments 
however  many other third party payers  under a published positive coverage policy or on a case by case basis  continue to provide reimbursement for urgent pc treatments 
starting in the second half of fiscal  sales over corresponding year ago periods of our urgent pc system declined and continued to do so in fiscal because of reimbursement related issues  although sales stabilized at around million to million per quarter in fiscal we expect urgent pc sales in the us will likely decline further in fiscal and we do not expect the sales to return to prior historical levels until after we obtain a unique  listed cpt code and payers create coverage policies that provide adequate reimbursement 
a major part of our strategy  supported by publication of clinical studies in peer reviewed journals in the us  has been to obtain a unique  listed current procedure technology cpt code for ptns  and expand third party reimbursement coverage of urgent pc treatments in the us additionally  we continue to implement a comprehensive program designed to educate medicare carriers and private payer medical directors about the benefits and clinical study results of urgent pc 
during the past eighteen months we have sponsored and received favorable results from clinical trials designed to demonstrate the efficacy of our urgent pc system  and to date five new articles have been published in us medical journals on urgent pc 
the most recent publications in the journal of urology include the results of the week orbit clinical trial  published in the september issue  the long term phase of the orbit clinical trial  published in the january issue  and the week sumit clinical trial  published in the april issue 
we submitted an application for a unique  listed cpt code to the ama for consideration at the cpt editorial panel meeting in february the ama has advised us that they have assigned a unique  listed cpt code for ptns 
this decision is expected to be published in the federal register by the centers for medicare and 
table of contents medicaid services by october nevertheless  the code will not be become effective until january  the suggested reimbursement amount for urgent pc treatments is not yet established  the exact cpt code number is not yet assigned  and no private payers or governmental agencies have agreed  or considered to agree  to provide reimbursement on the basis of this new cpt code prior to its effective date 
while we believe the availability of a unique  listed cpt code will encourage broader use of our urgent pc  there is no assurance that additional payers will agree to create coverage policies or that the policies  if they create  will provide adequate reimbursement 
we have increased our emphasis on sales of our macroplastique product in the united states 
we have expanded our marketing activities and conducted specific sales training programs with our us sales representatives to increase their ability to understand and advise clinicians as to its use and benefits with the expectation of increased sales 
as a result  fiscal macroplastique sales in the us about doubled over fiscal and we anticipate increased sales in fiscal critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts  giving due consideration to materiality 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following can be characterized as critical accounting policies and are particularly important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial position 
these critical policies may require the application of a higher level of judgment by uroplasty management  and as a result are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of ownership have passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we include in net sales shipping and handling charges we bill to customers  and include the related shipping and handling costs that we incur in cost of sales 
we present our sales in our income statement net of taxes  such as sales  use  value added and certain excise taxes  collected from the customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
typically our agreements contain no customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
we sell our products to clinics  healthcare institutions  physicians and other healthcare providers  and to distributors 
the distributor payment terms are not contingent on the distributor selling the product to end users 
customers do not have the right to return unsold products except for warranty claims 
our distributors purchase our products to meet the sales demand of their end user customers as well as to fulfill their internal requirements associated with the sales process and  if applicable  contractual purchase requirements under the respective distribution agreements 
internal and other requirements include purchases of products for training  demonstration and evaluation purposes  clinical evaluations  product support  establishing inventories  and meeting minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  the level of our net sales during any period is not necessarily indicative of our distributors sales to end user customers during that period  which we estimate are not substantially different than our sales to those distributors in each of the last two years 
our distributors level of inventories of our products  their sales to end user customers and their internal product requirements may impact our future revenue growth 
accounts receivable 
we carry our accounts receivable at the original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a periodic review of all outstanding amounts 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the customer s financial health  and both historical and expected credit loss experience 
we write off our accounts receivable when we deem them uncollectible 
we record recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off when received 
we are not always able to accurately or timely anticipate changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection 
table of contents experience 
historically  the accounts receivable balances we have written off have generally been within our expectations 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we provide lower of cost or market reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon current and expected future product sales and the expected impact of product transitions or modifications 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
while we expect our sales to grow  a reduction in sales could reduce the demand for our products and may require additional inventory reserves 
historically  inventories we have written off have generally been within our expectations 
foreign currency translation transactions 
the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries were translated in accordance with the provisions of asc foreign currency matters 
under this statement  we translate all assets and liabilities using period end exchange rates  and we translate statements of operations items using average exchange rates for the period 
we record the resulting translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the statement of operations  including unrealized gains and losses on short term intercompany obligations using period end exchange rates  resulting in an increase in the volatility of our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we use judgment to forecast future cash flows including forecasting revenues and margins  and working capital needs 
if we consider such assets impaired  we measure the impairment to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we did not record any impairment charge in fiscal years or share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation costs under asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires that we recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  in our financial statements 
we must measure that cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
asc covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
defined benefit pension plans 
we have a liability attributed to defined benefit pension plans we offered to certain former and current employees the liability is dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates  and the continued benefit costs we incur may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate  mortality  compensation rates  or retirement dates used to determine the projected benefit obligation 
additionally  changes made to the provisions of the plans may impact current and future benefit costs 
in accordance with accounting rules  changes in benefit obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
as of march   we have generated approximately million in us net operating loss carryforwards that we cannot use to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
we recognize a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
we have established a valuation allowance for us and certain foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty that we will generate enough income in those taxing jurisdictions to utilize the assets 

table of contents in addition  future utilization of nol carryforwards are subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
we believe that the issuance of our common stock in the december follow on public offering resulted in an ownership change under section accordingly  our ability to use nol tax attributes generated prior to december may be limited 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
results of operations net sales 
in fiscal  net sales were million  representing a million or decrease compared to net sales of million in fiscal excluding the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales decreased by approximately our fiscal sales over the corresponding periods in fiscal declined in the first half and declined in the second half 
in the us  in the first half of fiscal we had growing success with sales of our urgent pc product  but  because of reimbursement related issues  those sales started to decline in the second half of fiscal and continued to do so in fiscal partially offsetting this decline was the growing sales of macroplastique product in the us additionally  first half sales in fiscal to customers outside of the us declined over the corresponding year ago period primarily due to increased competition in sales of our macroplastique products in europe 
sales to customers in the us in fiscal totaled million  representing a million or decline compared to million in fiscal we attribute this decline to the decline in sales of our urgent pc product  partially offset by an increase in sales of our macroplastique product 
sales in the us of our urgent pc product declined to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the trend in decline of our urgent pc sales over corresponding year ago periods began in the second half of fiscal due to reimbursement related issues 
urgent pc sales in fiscal have stabilized at around million to million per quarter 
sales in the us of macroplastique product increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal sales of macroplastique product have steadily increased because of our increased sales and marketing focus 
in fiscal  we anticipate sales of macroplastique product in the us to continue to grow as we expect to benefit from our continued sales and marketing focus 
we do not expect that we will be able to return to the historic sales level of urgent pc product in the us until after a unique  listed cpt becomes effective in january and payers create coverage policies that provide adequate reimbursement 
sales to customers outside the us were million in fiscal  a decline of  from million in fiscal excluding the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  sales declined by approximately 
we believe the sales decrease is mainly attributed to increased competition from a newly introduced product against our macroplastique product 
in addition  in fiscal year we discontinued in the united kingdom our i stop urethral sling product which accounted for approximately  of sales in fiscal gross profit gross profit was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  or and of net sales in the respective periods 
we attribute the lower gross profit percentage primarily to a decrease in manufacturing capacity utilization as a result of the decline in sales  changes in sales product mix  and the negative impact of changes in the currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated sales 
the first two factors each had an approximately percentage point negative effect and the last factor had an approximately percentage point negative effect on the gross profit percentage 
general and administrative expenses g a g a expenses decreased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in fiscal is a  non cash  share based compensation charge  compared to a charge of  in fiscal excluding share based compensation charges  g a expenses decreased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal g a expenses decreased primarily because of a  decrease in professional and consulting fees  a  decrease in bad debt expenses  a  decrease in travel costs  and other reductions as we implemented cost reduction measures 
the 
table of contents decrease of professional and consulting fees is primarily attributed to reduction of audit and tax fees  and reductions in consulting for investor relations and information services 
the decrease of bad debt expense is mainly attributed to a  recovery of a customer receivable in fiscal for which we had reserved  in fiscal we have implemented concentrated efforts to reduce expenses until reimbursement in the us for urgent pc recovers and the economy improves 
research and development expenses r d r d expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is attributed to a  decrease in spending for clinical studies  a  decrease in travel costs and a  decrease in consulting expense  offset partially by an  increase in compensation related costs 
we undertook clinical studies that we anticipate may assist us in obtaining a unique  listed cpt code that will encourage broader use of our urgent pc 
in fiscal we spent million for clinical studies compared to million in fiscal while we do not anticipate spending any more for clinical studies to support our efforts to obtain a unique  listed cpt code  we expect to spend approximately million in fiscal for ongoing marketing efforts and to meet regulatory requirements 
selling and marketing expenses s m s m expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the decrease to a  decrease in commissions due to the decrease in sales  a  decrease in compensation related costs on lower headcount and share based charges  a  decrease in travel costs  a  decrease in cost to support our marketing activities and a  decrease in consultancy costs  mainly related to reimbursement for our urgent pc product 
although we have maintained our assembled us sales force and redirected some of their effort to our macroplastique product line until reimbursement for urgent pc stabilizes  we have taken steps to control other sales and marketing expenses 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was  in each of the fiscal years and in april  we acquired from cystomedix  inc  certain intellectual property assets related to the urgent pc system for million  which we are amortizing over six years 
other income expense other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  foreign currency exchange gains and losses and other non operating costs when incurred 
net other income was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decline in net other income is attributed primarily to the decline in interest income on lower cash balance and interest rates 
we recognize exchange gains and losses primarily as a result of fluctuations in currency rates between the us dollar the functional reporting currency and the euro and british pound currencies of our subsidiaries  as well as their effect on the dollar denominated short term intercompany obligations between us and our foreign subsidiaries 
we recognized foreign currency exchange loss of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
income tax expense benefit we recorded income tax expense of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal we recorded an income tax charge of  for a settlement we reached with the netherlands tax authorities for income tax liability for fiscal years to we cannot use our us net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
non gaap financial measures 
the following table reconciles our operating loss calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap to non gaap financial measures that exclude non cash charges for share based compensation  and depreciation and amortization expenses from gross profit  operating expenses and operating loss 
the non gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by us are not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures and consolidated financial results calculated in accordance with gaap  and you should carefully evaluate our reconciliations to non gaap 
we may calculate our non gaap financial measures differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to those used by other 
table of contents companies 
we have described the reconciliations of each of our non gaap financial measures described above to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
we use these non gaap financial measures  and in particular non gaap operating loss  for internal managerial purposes and incentive compensation for senior management because we believe such measures are one important indicator of the strength and the operating performance of our business 
analysts and investors frequently ask us for this information 
we believe that they use such measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry  including as a means of comparing period to period results and as a means of evaluating our results with those of other companies

at march   our cash and cash equivalent and short term investments balances totaled million 
at march   we had working capital of approximately million 
in fiscal  we used million of cash in operating activities  compared to million of cash used in fiscal we attribute the increase in cash used in operating activities primarily to a reduction in working capital liabilities  primarily attributed to reduction in compensation related accruals  offset partially by reduction in inventories 
in fiscal we used approximately  to purchase property  plant and equipment compared with approximately  in fiscal in fiscal we used approximately  of cash in financing activities to fully retire our term debt 
sources of liquidity 
on october  we renewed our credit line with venture bank 
the agreement provides for a credit line of up to million secured by the assets of our company 
we may borrow up to to a maximum of  of the value of our eligible inventory on hand and of the value of our eligible us accounts receivable  provided  however  our total liabilities  inclusive of the amount borrowed  may not exceed our tangible net worth 
to be eligible to borrow any amount  we must maintain a minimum 
table of contents tangible net worth of million 
at march  we had tangible net worth of approximately million  and had no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
we estimate we had a borrowing capacity of approximately million at march  interest on the loan is charged at a per annum rate of the greater of or one percentage point over the prime rate prime rate on march  
uroplasty bv  our subsidiary  has an agreement with rabobank of the netherlands for a  approximately  credit line secured by our facility in geleen  the netherlands 
the bank charges interest on the loan at the rate of one percentage point over the rabobank base interest rate base rate on march   subject to a minimum interest rate of per annum 
at march   we had no borrowings outstanding on this credit line 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs over the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional financing to support our operations and planned growth activities in the future as we have yet to achieve profitability and generate positive cash flows 
to achieve profitability  we must generate substantially more revenue than we have this year or in prior years 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend  in large part  on our ability to achieve widespread market acceptance for our products and successfully expand our business in the us  which in turn may be partially dependent upon re establishing broad reimbursement for our urgent pc product and successfully demonstrating the superiority of our macroplastique product to clinicians 
we cannot guarantee that we will be entirely successful in either of these pursuits 
if we are unable to raise the needed funds  we may need to curtail our operations including product development  clinical studies and sales and marketing activities 
this would adversely impact our future business and prospects 
ultimately  we will need to achieve profitability and generate positive cash flows from operations to meet our cash needs and grow our business 
commitments and contingencies 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs for clinical studies to support our ongoing marketing efforts and to meet regulatory requirements 
we also expect to continue to incur significant expenses to support our us sales and marketing organization  and for regulatory activities 
under a royalty agreement we pay royalties of five percent of net sales of macroplastique in countries where a patent is filed subject to a monthly minimum of  the royalties payable under this agreement will continue until certain patents referenced in the agreement expire in and under a license agreement for the macroplastique implantation system  we pay a royalty of british pounds for each unit sold during the life of the patent 
in our normal course of business we have commitments  generally for periods of less than twelve months  to purchase from various vendors finished goods and manufacturing components under issued purchase orders 
we have a defined benefit pension plan covering seven current and nineteen former employees in the netherlands 
we pay premiums to an insurance company to fund annuities for the current employees 
we are responsible for funding additional annuities based on continued service and future salary increases 
we closed this defined benefit plan for new employees in april as of that date  the netherlands subsidiary established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
we also have a defined benefit pension plan for six former employees of our uk subsidiary 
we closed this plan to further accrual for all employees effective december   and  effective march  established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees
