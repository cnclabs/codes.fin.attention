table of contents our business our primary focus is to deliver technology solutions 
we have evolved our product set by expanding our technology credentials with our key vendors and developing proprietary software and engineering services 
our current offerings include direct marketing of information technology equipment and third party software  advanced professional services  proprietary software  including order entry and order management software onesource  procurement  asset management  document management and distribution software  and electronic catalog content management software and services  and leasing  and business process services 
we have been in the business of selling  leasing  financing  and managing information technology and other assets for more than years and have been providing software for more than years 
we currently derive the majority of our revenues from information technology it product sales  advanced professional services  and leasing 
our sales are generated primarily by our internal sales force and through vendor relationships to our customers  which include commercial accounts  federal  state and local governments  k schools  and higher education institutions 
we also lease and finance equipment  and supply software and services directly and through relationships with vendors and equipment manufacturers 
our broad product offerings provide customers with a highly focused  end to end  turnkey solution for purchasing  lifecycle management  and financing for it products and services 
in addition  we offer asset based financing and leasing of capital assets and lifecycle management solutions for the assets during their useful life  including disposal 
we offer our customers a multi disciplinary approach for implementing  controlling  and maintaining cost savings throughout their organizations  allowing our customers to simplify their administrative processes  gain data transparency and visibility  and enhance internal controls and reporting 
the key elements of our business are direct it sales we are a direct marketer and authorized reseller of leading it products via our direct sales force and web based ordering solution  onesource 
advanced professional services we provide an array of internet telephony and internet communications  collaboration  cloud computing  virtual desktop infrastructure vdi  network design and implementation  storage  security  virtualization  business continuity  maintenance  and implementation services to support our customer base as part of our consolidated service offering

proprietary software we offer proprietary software  for enterprise supply management  which can be used as standalone solutions or be integrated as component of a bundled solution 
these include eprocurement  spend management  asset management  document management  and product content management software 
these systems can be installed behind our customer s firewall or operated as a service hosted by eplus 
our proprietary software and associated business process services allow us to better support and retain our customers in our technology sales and finance businesses 
we have developed and acquired these products and services to distinguish us from our competition by providing a comprehensive offering to customers 
our primary target customers are middle market and larger companies in the united states of america with annual revenues between million and billion 
we believe there are more than  target customers in this market 

table of contents industry background in the current marketplace  we believe demand for it equipment  services  and financing is being driven by the following industry trends in calendar year  it spending in most categories declined due to the economy 
in  many industry analysts are forecasting an increase in overall it spending in the us  and the first quarter produced solid results in many sectors of the industry 
we believe that customers are continuing to focus on cost savings initiatives by utilizing technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing  and we continue to provide these and other advanced technology solutions to meet these needs 
we believe customers are focused on improving their data and physical security  from their data centers to their end user mobile devices  and all points between 
these comprehensive and complex solutions may include consulting  hardware  software  and implementation  and ongoing maintenance and monitoring 
we have continued to focus our resources in these areas to meet expected customer demand 
we believe that customers are seeking to reduce the number of vendors they do business with for the purpose of improving internal efficiencies  enhancing accountability and improving supplier management practices  and reducing costs 
we have continued to enhance our relationships with premier manufacturers and gained the engineering and sales certifications required to provide the most desired technologies for our customers 
in addition  we have continued to enhance our automated business processes  including eprocurement and electronic business solutions  such as onesource  to make transacting business with us more efficient and cost effective for our customers 
we introduced onesource it to improve internal business process efficiencies for customers ordering from multiple suppliers 
onesource it is positioned to help our customers and prospects reduce the number of suppliers they purchase from  eliminate multiple and unique ordering processes  provide a consolidated view of it purchases  consolidate invoice and payable processing and reduce the complexities of it spend through multiple suppliers 
we believe that customers prefer bundled offerings to include it products services and leasing  due to decreased liquidity in the global financial markets  as customers seek to preserve cash balances and working capital availability under bank lines 
we have continuously evolved our advanced professional service and software capabilities 
we believe that we are distinctively positioned to take advantage of this shift in the purchasing process as evidenced by continued development of our various integrated solutions  which we began developing in earlier than many other direct marketers and we continue to believe that our bundled solution set is a leader in the marketplace because of its breadth and depth of offerings 
we believe that we will continue to benefit from industry changes as a cost effective provider of a full range of it products and services with the added competitive advantage of in house proprietary software 
in addition  our ability to provide financing for capital assets to our customers and our lifecycle management solutions provides an additional benefit and differentiator in the marketplace 
while purchasing decisions will continue to be influenced by product selection and availability  price  and convenience  we believe that our comprehensive set of solutions is a differentiator that businesses will look for to reduce the total cost of ownership 
competition the market for it sales and professional services is intensely competitive  subject to economic conditions and rapid change  and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we expect to continue to compete in all areas of our business against local  regional  national and international firms  including manufacturers  other direct marketers  national and regional resellers  and regional  national  and international services providers 
in addition  many computer manufacturers may sell or lease directly to our customers  and our continued ability to compete effectively may be affected by the policies of such manufacturers 

table of contents we believe that we offer enhanced solution capability  broader product selection and availability  competitive prices  and greater purchasing convenience than traditional retail stores or value added resellers 
in addition  our dedicated account executives offer the necessary support functions eg  software  purchases on credit terms  leasing  and efficient return processes that internet only sellers do not usually provide 
we believe that we are one of the few companies in the united states that offers  as a principal  a comprehensive solution which can include eprocurement  leasing  advanced technology solutions  it fulfillment  and end to end asset management services 
the market for leasing is intensely competitive and subject to changing economic conditions and market activities of industry participants 
we expect to continue to compete against local  regional  national and international firms  including banks  specialty finance companies  vendors captive finance companies  and third party leasing companies 
banks and other large financial services companies sell directly to business customers  particularly larger enterprise customers  and may provide other financial or ancillary services that we do not provide 
vendor captive leasing companies may utilize internal transfer pricing to effectively lower lease rates and or bundle equipment sales and leasing to provide highly competitive packages to customers 
third party leasing companies may have deep customer and contractual relationships that are difficult to displace 
however  these competitors typically do not offer the breadth of product  service  and software offerings that we offer our customers 
we believe that we offer an enhanced leasing solution to our customers which provides a business process services approach that can automate the leasing process and reduce our customers cost of doing business with us 
the solution incorporates value added services at every step in the leasing process  including front end processing  such as eprocurement  order aggregation  order automation  vendor performance measurement  ordering  reconciliation  and payment  lifecycle and asset ownership services  including asset management  change management  and property tax filing  and end of life services such as equipment audit  removal  and disposal 
in addition  we are able to bundle equipment sales and professional services to provide a turnkey leasing solution 
this allows us to differentiate ourselves with a customer service strategy that spans the continuum from fast delivery of competitively priced products to end of life disposal services  and a selling approach that permits us to grow with customers and solidify those relationships 
we have expanded our product and service offerings under our comprehensive set of solutions which represents the continued evolution of our original implementation of our e commerce products entitled eplussuite 
the expansion to our bundled solution is a framework that combines our it sales and professional services  leasing and financing services  asset management software and services  procurement software  and electronic catalog content management software and services 
in the software market  there are a number of companies developing and marketing business to business electronic commerce solutions similar to ours  and competitors are migrating their offerings to a software as a service saas platform 
some of these competitors and potential competitors include enterprise resource planning erp system vendors and other major software vendors that are expected to sell their procurement and asset management products along with their application suites 
these erp vendors have a significant installed customer base and have the opportunity to offer additional products to those customers as additional components of their respective application suites 
we also face indirect competition from potential customers internal development efforts and have to overcome potential customers reluctance to move away from existing legacy systems and processes 
we believe that the principal competitive factors for the solution are scalability  functionality  ease of use  ease of implementation  ability to integrate with existing legacy systems  experience in business to business supply chain management  and knowledge of a business asset management needs 
we believe we can compete favorably with our competitors in these areas within our framework that consists of onesource  onesource it  procure  spend  manage  content  eplus leasing  strategic sourcing  document management software  and business process outsourcing 
in all of our markets  some of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional marketing and advertising activities  offer more attractive terms to customers  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do 

table of contents for a discussion of risks associated with the actions of our competitors  see item a  risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
strategy our goal is to become a leading provider of bundled solution offerings in the it supply chain 
the key elements of our strategy include the following selling additional products and services to our existing customer base  expanding our customer base  making strategic acquisitions  expanding our advanced professional services offerings  strengthening vendor relationships  and enhancing the effectiveness of our software offerings  especially onesource 
selling additional products and services to our existing customer base we seek to become the primary provider of it solutions for our customers by delivering the best customer service  pricing  availability  and professional services in the most efficient manner 
we continue to focus on improving our sales efficiency by providing on going training  targeted incentive compensation  and by implementing better automation processes to reduce costs and improve productivity 
our account executives are being trained on our broad solutions capabilities and to sell in a consultative manner that increases the likelihood of cross selling our solutions 
we believe that our bundled offerings are an important differentiating factor from our competitors 
in  we announced a new software portal called onesource  which is an integrated order entry platform to enhance product sales  increase incremental sales  and reduce costs by eliminating touch points for order automation 
in  we extended the onesource brand by creating two differentiated solutions onesourceit  for purchasing from eplus technology catalog  and onesourceit  for purchasing from eplus and other technology vendors 
we continue to offer procure  content  and spend  a full suite of eprocurement  catalog content management  and spend analysis applications on an saas or enterprise basis 
in  we started a telesales group of experienced telesales sales professionals and engineers 
this group is focused on marketing to existing and new customers primarily within the geographic reach of our existing service areas 
expanding our customer base we intend to increase our direct sales and targeted marketing efforts in each of our geographic and vertical industry areas 
we actively seek to acquire new account relationships through a new outbound telesales effort  face to face field sales  electronic commerce especially onesource  and targeted direct marketing to increase awareness of our solutions 
making strategic acquisitions based on our prior experience  capital structure  and business systems and processes  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that broaden our customer base  expand our geographic reach  scale our existing operating structure  and or enhance our product and service offerings 
it is part of our growth strategy to evaluate and consider strategic acquisition opportunities if and when they become available 

table of contents expanding advanced professional service offerings we have focused on gaining engineering certifications and advanced professional services expertise in advanced technologies of strategic vendors  such as cisco systems  ibm  hp  netapp  vmware and sun microsystems 
we are especially focused on vdi  data center virtualization  unified communications  collaboration  cloud computing  networking  security  and storage technologies that are currently in high demand 
we believe our ability to deliver advanced professional services provides benefits in two ways 
first  we gain recognition and mindshare of our strategic vendor partners and become the go to partner in selected regional and national markets 
this significantly increases direct and referral sales opportunities to provide our products and services  and allows us to achieve optimal pricing levels 
second  within our own existing and potential customer base  our advanced professional services are a key differentiator against competitors who cannot provide services or advanced services for these key technologies 
strengthening vendor relationships we believe it is important to maintain relationships with key manufacturers such as vmware  hp  ibm  cisco  and netapp on both a national level  for strategic purposes  and at the local level  for tactical objectives 
strategically  national relationships with key manufacturers give us increased visibility and legitimacy  and authenticate our services 
in addition  by maintaining a number of high level engineering certifications  we are promoted as a high level solutions provider by certain manufacturers 
on a tactical level  by having more than locations  we are able to maintain direct relationships with key sales and marketing personnel from the manufacturer  who provide referral sales opportunities that are unavailable to internet only and catalog based direct marketers 
enhancing the effectiveness of our internet based solutions  especially onesource we will continue to improve and expand the functionality of our integrated  internet based solutions to better serve our customers needs 
we intend to use the flexibility of our platform to offer additional products and services when economically feasible 
as part of this strategy  we may also acquire technology companies to expand and enhance the platform of solutions to provide additional functionality and value added services 
research and development in the s  we utilized licensed software and outsourced development to provide software and hosted software related services to our customers  but with the acquisition of software products and the hiring of employees from acquisitions in the early s  our products are comprised of our own proprietary software 
we expense software development costs as they are incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
at such time  development costs are capitalized until the product is made available for release to customers 
for the year ended march   no such costs were capitalized and thousand was amortized 
for the year ended march   no such costs were capitalized and thousand was amortized 
we have also outsourced certain programming tasks to an offshore software development company to supplement our internal development  support  and quality assurance 
to successfully implement our business strategy and service the disparate requirements of our customers and potential customers  we have a flexible delivery model  which includes traditional enterprise licenses  hosted or subscription  and software as a service saas  or a services model  where our personnel may utilize our software to provide one or more solutions to our customers 
we expect that competitive factors will create a continuing need for us to improve and add to our technology platform 
the addition of new products and services will also require that we continue to improve the technology underlying our applications 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in systems  personnel  and offshore development to maintain a competitive advantage in this market 

table of contents sales and marketing we focus our marketing efforts on lead generation activities and converting our existing customer base to our bundled solution set 
the target market for our customer base is primarily middle and large market companies with annual revenues between million and billion 
we believe there are over  potential customers in our target market 
we undertake many of our direct marketing campaigns to target certain markets in conjunction with our primary vendor partners  who may provide financial reimbursement  outsourced services  and personnel to assist us in these efforts 
our sales representatives are compensated by a combination of salary and commission  with commission becoming the primary component of compensation as the sales representatives gain experience 
to date  the majority of our customers have been generated from direct sales 
we market to different areas within a customer s organization depending on the products or services we are selling 
in  we started a telesales group consisting of experienced telesales sales professionals and engineers 
this group is focused on marketing to existing and new customers primarily within the geographic reach of our existing service areas 
as of march   our sales force was organized regionally in office locations throughout the united states 
see item  properties of this form k for additional office location information 
as of march   our sales organization included sales  marketing  and sales support personnel 
intellectual property rights our success depends in part upon proprietary business methodologies and technologies that we have licensed and modified 
we own certain software programs or have entered into software licensing agreements to provide services to our customers 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  service mark  trade secret protection  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect intellectual property rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
for example  we have in the united states three electronic sourcing system patents  two of which are currently under re examination by the united states patent and trademark office uspto  six catalog management patents  three image transmission management patents  a patent for collaborative editing of electronic documents over a network  and a hosted asset information management patent  among others 
we have a counterpart of the electronic sourcing system patents in nine european forums  and a counterpart of the image transmission management patents in five additional forums 
in  the three us patents for electronic sourcing systems were determined to be valid and enforceable by a jury at trial 
however  in  a trial to enforce the same patents ended in a mistrial 
we cannot provide assurance that any patents  as issued  will prevent the development of competitive products or that our patents will not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated through the administrative process or litigation 
otherwise  the earliest of the three electronic sourcing system patents is scheduled to expire in  the three image transmission patents are scheduled to expire in  the earliest of the catalog management patents is scheduled to expire in  and the patent for collaborative editing of electronic documents over a network is scheduled to expire in  provided that all maintenance fees are paid in accordance with uspto regulations 
we also have the following registered service trademarks eplus  directsight  procure  manage  finance  eplus leasing  docpak  viewmark  digital paper  onesource  content  eecm  and eplus enterprise cost management 
in addition  we have over twenty registered copyrights and additional common law trademarks and copyrights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy could be expected to be a persistent problem 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our proprietary intellectual property 
sales and financing activities we have been in the business of selling  and providing advanced technology services for a wide array of information technology assets and software  leasing  and financing of it and other capital assets and services  and a software publisher for procurement  content management  document management and asset management software 
we currently derive the majority of our revenues from such activities 

table of contents it sales and professional services 
we are an authorized reseller of  or have the right to resell products and services from  over manufacturers 
our most important manufacturer relationships include cisco  hp  sun microsystem  netapp  and ibm 
tech data and ingram micro  inc are the largest distributors we utilize 
we have multiple vendor engineering certifications that authorize us to market their products and enable us to provide advanced professional services 
our flexible platform and customizable catalogs facilitate the addition of new vendors with minimal incremental effort 
using the distribution systems available  we usually sell products that are shipped from the distributors or suppliers directly to our customer s location  which allows us to keep our inventory of any product and shipping expenses to a minimum 
the products we sell typically have payment account terms ranging from payment in advance  by credit card  due upon delivery  or days to pay  depending on the customer s credit and payment structure 
leasing and financing 
our leasing and financing transactions generally fall into two categories direct financing and operating leases 
direct financing transfers substantially all of the benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
operating leases consist of all other leases that do not meet the criteria to be direct financing or sales type leases 
our lease transactions include true leases and installment sales or conditional sales contracts with corporations  non profit entities and municipal and federal government contractors 
substantially all of our lease transactions are net leases with a specified non cancelable lease term and a fixed amount of rent 
these non cancelable leases have a provision which requires the lessee to make all lease payments without offset or counterclaim 
a net lease requires the lessee to make the full lease payment and pay any other expenses associated with the use of equipment  such as maintenance  casualty and liability insurance  sales or use taxes and personal property taxes 
we primarily lease computers  associated accessories and software  communication related equipment  and medical equipment  and we may also lease industrial machinery and equipment  office furniture and general office equipment  transportation equipment  and other general business equipment 
in anticipation of the expiration of the term of a lease  we initiate the remarketing process for the related equipment 
our goal is to maximize revenues from the remarketing effort by either releasing or selling the equipment to the initial lessee  renting the equipment to the initial lessee on a month to month basis  or selling the equipment to an equipment broker or leasing the equipment to a different customer 
the remarketing process is intended to enable us to recover or exceed the original estimated residual value of the leased equipment 
any amounts received over the estimated residual value less any commission expenses become profit margin to us and can significantly impact the degree of profitability of a lease transaction 
we aggressively manage the remarketing process of our leases to maximize the residual values of our leased equipment portfolio 
to date  we have realized a premium over our original recorded residual assumption or the net book value 
financing and bank relationships 
we have a number of bank and finance company relationships that we use to provide working capital for our businesses and long term financing for our lease financing businesses 
our finance department is responsible for maintaining and developing relationships with a diversified pool of commercial banks and finance companies with varying terms and conditions 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
risk management and process controls 
it is our goal to minimize the financial risks of our balance sheet assets 
to accomplish this goal  we use and maintain conservative underwriting policies and disciplined credit approval processes 
we also have internal control processes  including credit management  contract origination and management  cash management  servicing  collections  remarketing and accounting 
we may utilize non recourse financing which is secured by a lease s underlying equipment and the specific lease and not our general assets for our leasing transactions and we try to obtain lender commitments before acquiring the related assets 
when desirable  we manage our risk in assets by selling leased assets  including the residual portion of leases  to third parties rather than owning them 
for certain transactions  we may act as an intermediary and obtain commitments for these asset sales before we consummate the lease 
we also use agency purchase orders to procure equipment for lease to our customers as an agent  not a principal  and otherwise take measures to minimize our inventory 
additionally  we use fixed rate funding and issue proposals that adjust for material adverse interest rate movements as well as material adverse changes to the financial condition of the customer 
we have an executive management review process and other internal controls in place to evaluate the transactions potential risk 
our lease and sale contracts are reviewed by senior management for pricing  structure  documentation  and credit quality 
due in part to our strategy of focusing on a few types of equipment categories  we have product knowledge  historical re marketing information and experience with many of the items that we lease  sell  and service 
we rely on our experience or outside opinions to set and adjust our sale prices  lease rate factors  and residual values

item a 
risk factors general economic weakness may harm our operating results and financial condition our results of operations are dependent  to a large extent  upon the state of the economy 
global economies and financial markets continue to experience significant uncertainty and volatility 
continued adverse economic conditions may decrease our customers demand for our products and services or impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased 
in addition  many state and local governments who are our customers are experiencing financial difficulties which are causing budget shortfalls and resulting in decreased demand for our products and services 
as a result  our revenues could decrease and reserves for our credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable may increase 
during the fiscal year ended march   sales of product and services decreased to million compared to the last fiscal year 
the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions  including the lender under our credit facility  and  from time to time  we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  financial institutions or the financial services industry generally  could result in losses or defaults by these institutions 
in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties  we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to access credit facilities or complete transactions as intended  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents we may be required to take additional impairment charges for goodwill or intangible assets related to acquisitions we have acquired certain portions of our business and certain assets through acquisitions 
further  as part of our long term business strategy  we may continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies or assets 
in connection with prior acquisitions  we have accounted for the portion of the purchase price paid in excess of the book value of the assets acquired as goodwill or intangible assets  and we may be required to account for similar premiums paid on future acquisitions in the same manner 
under the applicable accounting rules  goodwill is not amortized and is carried on our books at its original value  subject to periodic review and evaluation for impairment  whereas intangible assets are amortized over the life of the asset 
changes in the business itself  the economic environment including business valuation levels and trends  or the legislative or regulatory environment may trigger a periodic review and evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment 
these changes may adversely affect either the fair value of the business or the fair value of our individual reporting units and we may be required to take an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying values of our goodwill or intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the business in the reporting unit with goodwill and intangible assets 
also  if we sell a business for less than the book value of the assets sold  plus any goodwill or intangible assets attributable to that business  we may be required to take an impairment charge on all or part of the goodwill and intangible assets attributable to that business 
we determined that our goodwill related to the leasing business unit was impaired  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million during the third quarter of fiscal if market and economic conditions deteriorate further  this could increase the likelihood that we will need to record additional impairment charges to the extent the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the fair value of our overall business 
such impairment charges could materially adversely affect our net earnings during the period in which the charge is taken 
we may not be able to realize our entire investment in the equipment we lease the realization of equipment values residual values during the life and at the end of the term of a lease is an important element in our leasing business 
at the inception of each lease  we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the expected disposition date 
a decrease in the market value of leased equipment at a rate greater than the rate we projected  whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence  unusual wear and tear on the equipment  excessive use of the equipment  or other factors  would adversely affect the current or residual values of such equipment 
further  certain equipment residual values are dependent on the manufacturer s or vendor s warranties  reputation and other factors  including market liquidity 
in addition  we may not realize the full market value of equipment if we are required to sell it to meet liquidity needs or for other reasons outside of the ordinary course of business 
consequently  there can be no assurance that we will realize our estimated residual values for equipment 
the degree of residual realization risk varies by transaction type 
direct financing leases bear the least risk because contractual payments cover approximately or more of the equipment s inception of lease cost 
operating leases have a higher degree of risk because a smaller percentage of the equipment s value is covered by contractual cash flows at lease inception 
we depend on having creditworthy customers our leasing and technology sales business requires sufficient amounts of debt and equity capital to fund our equipment purchases 
if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases  or if we experience a material increase in our credit losses  we may find it difficult to continue to obtain the capital we require and our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
in addition to the impact on our ability to attract capital  a material increase in our delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our lenders have reduced their demand for non investment grade leases which has made financing lower credit customers more difficult or impossible in some cases 

table of contents changes in the it industry and or rapid changes in product standards may result in substantial inventory obsolescence and may reduce demand for the it hardware  software and services we sell our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors  including the condition of the it industry  shifts in demand for  or availability of  it hardware  software  peripherals and services  and industry introductions of new products  upgrades or methods of distribution 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products  product enhancements and new distribution methods or channels  each of which can decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete 
sales of products and services can be dependent on demand for specific product categories  and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and or cause us to record write downs of obsolete inventory  if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes 
we may not reserve adequately for our credit losses our reserve for credit losses reflects management s judgment of the loss potential of our lease portfolio and accounts receivable 
our management bases its judgment on the nature and financial characteristics of our obligors  general economic conditions and our bad debt experience 
we also consider delinquency rates and the value of the collateral underlying the finance receivables 
we cannot be certain that our consolidated reserve for credit losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific customers  industries or markets 
if our reserves for credit losses are not adequate  our business  operating results and financial condition may suffer 
we rely on inventory and accounts receivable financing arrangements the loss of the technology sales business segment s credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we currently rely on this facility and its components for daily working capital and the operational function of our accounts payable process 
our credit agreement contains various net worth and debt covenants that must be met each quarter 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those debt covenants and failure to do so may limit availability of  or cause us to lose  such financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available to us in the future on acceptable terms 
we may not adequately protect ourselves through our contract vehicles or insurance policies we may not properly create contracts to protect ourselves against the risks inherent in our business including  but not limited to  warranties  limitations of liability  human resources and subcontractors  patent and product liability  and financing activities 
despite the non recourse nature of the loans financing our activities  non recourse lenders have  in the past  brought suit when the underlying transaction turns out poorly for the lenders 
we have vigorously defended such cases in the past and will do so in the future  however  investors should be aware that we are subject to such suits and the cost of defending such suits due to the nature of our business 
costs to protect our intellectual property may affect our earnings the legal and associated costs to protect our intellectual property may significantly increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may deem it necessary to protect our intellectual property rights and significant expenses could be incurred with no certainty of the results of these potential actions 
costs relative to lawsuits are usually expensed in the periods incurred and there is no certainty in recouping any of the amounts expended regardless of the outcome of any action 
we face risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement that could harm our business we cannot provide assurance that our products and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  we may not be aware of applications that have been filed which relate to our products or processes 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against infringement claims 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we and our customers may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain such licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could significantly increase our expenses and or adversely affect our ability to offer one or more of our services 
in addition  in certain instances  third parties licensing software to us have refused to indemnify us for possible infringement claims 

table of contents capital spending by our customers may decrease we rely on our customers to purchase capital equipment from us to maintain or increase our earnings 
if there is a further decline in the economy  or an increase in competition  sales of capital equipment may decrease  thus adversely affecting our earnings 
as a result of the recent economic turbulence and overall softening in the economy  our customers have generally delayed their investment in capital equipment and we have experienced a decrease in total sales 
continued weakness in the economy could continue to adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
we face substantial competition from larger companies as well as our vendors and financial partners in our reseller business  manufacturers may choose to market their products directly to end users  rather than through resellers such as our company  and this could adversely affect our future sales 
in addition  a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendors and financial partners could increase our need for and cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many competitors compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs or accept lower selling prices than us and  therefore  current gross margins may not be maintainable 
in addition  we do not have guaranteed commitments from our customers and  therefore  our sales volume may be volatile 
in our leasing business  we face competition from many sources including much larger companies with greater financial resources 
our competition may even come from some of our vendors or financial partners who choose to market directly to customers 
our competition may lower lease rates in order to increase market share 
we may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors we receive payments and credits from vendors  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs 
these programs are usually of finite terms and may not be renewed or may be changed in a way that has an adverse effect on us 
vendor funding is used to offset  among other things  inventory costs  costs of goods sold  marketing costs and other operating expenses 
certain of these funds are based on our volume of net sales or purchases  growth rate of net sales or purchases and marketing programs 
if we do not grow our net sales over prior periods or if we are not in compliance with the terms of these programs  there could be a material negative effect on the amount of incentives offered or paid to us by vendors 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive such incentives or that we will be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to these incentives in a timely manner  or at all 
any sizeable reduction in  the discontinuance of  a significant delay in receiving or the inability to collect such incentives  particularly related to incentive programs with our largest partners  hp and cisco  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to react timely to any fundamental changes in the programs of vendors  including the elimination of funding for some of the activities for which we have been compensated in the past  such changes would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there is a risk that we could lose a large customer without being able to find a ready replacement for the fiscal year  no one customer accounted for or more of our total revenues 
our top twenty five customers in fiscal year represented an aggregate of approximately of total revenue 
our contracts for the provision of products are generally non exclusive agreements that are terminable by either party upon days notice 
either the loss of any large customer  or the failure of any large customer to pay its accounts receivable on a timely basis  or a material reduction in the amount of purchases made by any large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we may not be able to hire and retain personnel that we need to succeed to increase market awareness and sales of our offerings  we may need to expand our sales operations and marketing efforts in the future 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort and significant technical support 
for example  our sales and engineering candidates must have highly technical hardware and software knowledge in order to suggest a customized solution for our customers business processes 
competition for qualified sales  marketing and technical personnel fluctuates depending on market conditions and we might not be able to hire or retain sufficient numbers of such personnel to maintain and grow our business 
increasingly  our competitors are requiring their employees to agree to non compete and non solicitation agreements as part of the employment  and this could make it more difficult for us to hire those persons 
we do not have long term supply or guaranteed price agreements with our vendors the loss of a key vendor or manufacturer or changes in their policies could adversely impact our ability to sell 
in addition  violation of a contract that results in either the termination of our ability to sell the product or a decrease in our certification with the manufacturer could adversely impact our earnings 
we may not have designed our information technology systems to support our business without failure we are dependent upon the reliability of our information  telecommunication and other systems  which are used for sales  distribution  marketing  purchasing  inventory management  order processing  customer service and general accounting functions 
interruption of our information systems  internet or telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
our earnings may fluctuate  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock our earnings are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including the impact of the economic environment on our customers procurement levels  the outcome of litigation  interest rates  decrease in funds received from incentive programs from manufacturers  impairment or other charges  and increases in our costs of goods sold and overhead expenses 
in the event our revenues or net income are less than the level expected by the market in general  such shortfall could have an immediate and significant adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business will suffer the success of our business strategy depends  in part  upon proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
to date  we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws and contractual provisions with our subcontractors to protect our proprietary technology 
it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
some of our agreements with our customers and technology licensors contain residual clauses regarding confidentiality and the rights of third parties to obtain the source code for our products 
these provisions may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in the future that could seriously harm our business and operating results 
our means of protecting our intellectual property rights may not be adequate 
our ability to consummate and integrate acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our profitability if we fail to achieve anticipated revenue improvements and cost reductions our ability to successfully integrate the operations we acquire to reduce costs  or leverage these operations to generate revenue and earnings growth  could significantly impact future revenue and earnings 
integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integrations successfully 
failure to successfully integrate acquired operations may adversely affect our cost structure thereby reducing our margins and return on investment 
in addition  we may acquire entities with unknown liabilities  fraud  cultural or business environment issues or that may not have adequate internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents our e commerce related products and services subjects us to challenges and risks in a rapidly evolving market as a provider of a comprehensive set of solutions  which involves the bundling of direct it sales  professional services and financing with our proprietary software  we expect to encounter some of the challenges  risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies providing new and or bundled solutions in rapidly evolving markets 
some of these challenges relate to our ability to increase the total number of users of our services  adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments  and continue to update our technology to enhance the features and functionality of our suite of products 
our business strategy may not be successful or successfully address these and other challenges  risks and uncertainties 
the electronic commerce business to business solutions market is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively the market for internet based  business to business electronic commerce solutions is extremely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  and competitive pressures faced by us may harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
in addition  the market for electronic procurement solutions is evolving 
our strategy of providing an internet based electronic commerce solution may not be successful  or we may not execute it effectively 
accordingly  our solution may not be widely adopted by businesses 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the electronic commerce market  competition from other established and emerging companies may develop in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in reduced margins  longer sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which could materially harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
the business to business electronic commerce solutions offered by our competitors now or in the future may be perceived by buyers and suppliers as superior to ours 
our current or future competitors may have more experience developing internet based software and end to end purchasing solutions 
they may also have greater technical  financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  competitors may be able to develop products and services that are superior  achieve greater customer acceptance or have significantly improved functionality as compared to our products and services 
over the long term  we expect to derive more revenues from our software  which is unproven 
we expect to incur significant sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses in connection with the development of this area of our business 
these expected expenses may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results as a whole 
our officers and directors own a significant amount of our common stock and may be able to exert a significant influence over corporate matters our officers and directors beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as a result  these stockholders acting together will be able to exert considerable influence over the election of our directors and the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of eplus and consequently could affect the market price of our common stock 
if our products contain defects  our business could suffer products as complex as those used to provide our electronic commerce solutions often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products 
undetected errors or performance problems may not be discovered in the future and errors considered by us to be minor may be considered serious by our customers 
in addition  our customers may experience a loss in connectivity by our hosted solution as a result of a power loss at our data center  internet interruption or defects in our software 
this could result in lost revenues  delays in customer acceptance or unforeseen liabilities that would be detrimental to our reputation and to our business 

table of contents if we publish inaccurate catalog content data  our business could suffer any defects or errors in catalog content data could harm our customers or deter businesses from participating in our offering  damage our business reputation  harm our ability to attract new customers  and potentially expose us to legal liability 
in addition  from time to time vendors who provide us electronic catalog data could submit to us inaccurate pricing or other catalog data 
even though such inaccuracies are not caused by our work and are not within our control  such inaccuracies could deter current and potential customers from using our products or result in inaccurate pricing to our customers

table of contents item legal proceedings cyberco related matters we have been involved in several matters relating to a customer named cyberco holdings  inc cyberco 
the cyberco principals were perpetrating a scam  and at least five principals have pled guilty to criminal conspiracy and or related charges  including bank fraud  mail fraud and money laundering 
we have previously disclosed our losses relating to cyberco  and are pursuing avenues to recover those losses 
we filed suit against one of our lenders  banc of america leasing and capital  llc boa  in the superior court in the state of california  county of san diego superior court seeking to recover losses relating to the cyberco transaction 
in december   the supreme court of california denied boa s petition for review of the california court of appeal s reversal of the trial court s dismissal of the case  and the matter has been remanded to the trial court 
we are also the defendant in one cyberco related case  in which boa filed a lawsuit against eplus in the circuit court for fairfax county  virginia  on november   seeking to enforce a guaranty in which eplus inc 
guaranteed eplus group s obligations to boa relating to the cyberco matter 
eplus group has already paid to boa million  which was awarded to boa in a prior lawsuit regarding the cyberco matter 
the suit against eplus inc 
seeks attorneys fees boa incurred in eplus group s appeal of boa s suit against eplus group  expenses boa incurred in cyberco s bankruptcy proceedings  attorneys fees incurred by boa in defending the above referenced case in the superior court in california  and all attorneys fees and costs boa has incurred arising in any way from the cyberco matter 
the trial in this suit has been stayed pending the outcome of eplus group s suit against boa in california 
we are vigorously defending the suit against us by boa 
we cannot predict the outcome of this suit 
in june  eplus group  inc 
and two other cyberco victims filed suit in the united states district court for the western district of michigan against the huntington national bank 
the complaint alleges counts of aiding and abetting fraud  aiding and abetting conversion  and statutory conversion 
while we believe that we have a basis for these claims to recover certain of our losses related to the cyberco matter  we cannot predict whether we will be successful in our claims for damages  whether any award ultimately received will exceed the costs incurred to pursue these matters  or how long it will take to bring these matters to resolution 
other matters the shareholder derivative action that was filed against us in has been concluded 
in april  a stipulation of dismissal was filed with the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  dismissing the plaintiff s appeal of the trial court s dismissal of the action 
the suit  which related to stock option practices  named eplus inc 
as nominal defendant and personally named eight individual defendants who at the time were directors and or executive officers of eplus 
we may become party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including preference payment claims asserted in customer bankruptcy proceedings  claims of alleged infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights  claims of alleged non compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations 
although we do not expect that the outcome in any of these matters  individually or collectively  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  litigation is inherently unpredictable 
therefore  judgments could be rendered or settlements entered that could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 
we provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable

item selected financial data this item has been omitted based on eplus status as a smaller reporting company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations financial review of eplus is intended to help investors understand our company and our operations 
the financial review is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
executive overview business description eplus and its consolidated subsidiaries provide leading it products and services  flexible leasing solutions  and enterprise supply management to enable our customers to optimize their it infrastructure and supply chain processes 
our revenues are composed of sales of product and services  sales of leased equipment  lease revenues and fee and other income 
our operations are conducted through two business segments our technology sales business unit and our financing business unit 
financial summary during the year ended march   total revenue decreased to million while total costs and expenses decreased to million 
net earnings decreased to million  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
during the first half of our fiscal year  the economy contracted and our sales followed 
however  the contraction of the economy appears to have stabilized and we have had sequential revenue growth over the past four quarters 
in addition  we had a increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the same period last year 
net earnings for the year ended march  included patent license and settlement income of million and a goodwill impairment charge of million for the leasing reporting unit 
during the third quarter when preparing the annual impairment test  the weakened us economy and the global credit crisis had accelerated the reduction in demand for leasing 
as a result of this reduced demand and a reduction in our overall portfolio from prior sales of tranches of leases in our portfolio  we projected a temporary decline in revenue in our leasing reporting unit  which lowered the fair value estimates of the reporting unit and resulted in a full impairment of this reporting unit s goodwill 
gross margin for product and services was during the year ended march  compared to during the year ended march  our gross margin on sales of product and services was affected by our customers investment in technology equipment  the mix and volume of products sold and changes in incentives provided to us by manufacturers 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we may modify terms with our vendors in order to achieve better incentives which may enhance gross margin 
cash decreased million or to million at march  compared to march  the decrease in cash was due  in part  to a gradual increase in sales during the current fiscal year  which increased accounts receivable and inventory  the deferment of non recourse financing associated with certain lease investments to increase interest earnings and a corresponding growth in lease investments  and our share repurchase program 

table of contents the united states and other countries around the world have been experiencing deteriorating economic conditions  including unprecedented financial market disruption 
as a result of the financial market turmoil  softness in the housing markets  difficulties in the financial services sector and continuing economic uncertainties  the direction and relative strength of the us economy is somewhat uncertain 
this has caused our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases  which has reduced sales of our products and services 
continuing deterioration of economic conditions could cause our current and potential customers to further delay or reduce technology purchases and result in longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
restrictions on credit may impact economic activity and our results 
credit risk associated with our customers and vendors may also be adversely impacted 
in addition  although we do not anticipate the need for additional capital in the near term due to our current financial position  financial market disruption may adversely affect our access to additional capital 
business unit overview technology sales business unit the technology sales business segment sells information technology equipment and software and related services primarily to corporate customers  state and local governments  and higher education institutions on a nationwide basis  with geographic concentrations relating to our physical locations 
the technology sales business unit also provides internet based business to business supply chain management solutions for information technology products 
our technology sales business segment derives revenue from the sales of new equipment and service engagements 
these revenues are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations under sales of product and services and fee and other income 
customers who purchase information technology equipment from us may have master purchase agreements mpas with us which stipulate the terms and conditions of our relationship 
some mpas contain pricing arrangements 
however  the mpas do not contain purchase volume commitments and most have day termination for convenience clauses 
our other customers place orders using purchase orders without an mpa in place or with other documentation customary for the business 
our services engagements are often governed by master services agreements msas which may contain specific statements of work sows and other terms and conditions customary in the business 
often  our work with governments is based on public bids and our written bid responses 
a substantial portion of our sales of product and services are from sales of cisco  hewlett packard and sun microsystem products  which represent approximately  and of sales of product and services  respectively  for the year ended march   as compared to  and of sales  respectively  for the year ended march  included in the sales of product and services in our technology sales business unit are certain service revenues that are bundled with sales of equipment and are integral to the successful delivery of such equipment 
our service engagements are generally governed by sows and msas  and are primarily fixed price with allowance for changes  however  some service agreements are based on time and materials 
we endeavor to minimize the cost of sales in our technology sales business segment through vendor consideration programs provided by manufacturers and other incentives provided by our distributors 
the programs provided by manufacturers are generally governed by our reseller authorization level with the manufacturer 
the authorization level we achieve and maintain governs the types of products we can resell as well as such items as pricing received  funds provided for the marketing of these products and other special promotions 
these authorization levels are achieved by us through sales volume  certifications held by sales executives or engineers and or contractual commitments by us 
the authorizations are costly to maintain and these programs continually change and  therefore  there is no guarantee of future reductions of costs provided by these vendor consideration programs 
we currently maintain the following authorization levels with our major manufacturers

these revenues are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations under fee and other income 
in addition  fee and other income results from income from events that occur after the initial sale of a financial asset  remarketing fees  agent fees received from various manufacturers  settlement fees related to disputes or litigation  and interest and other miscellaneous income 
financing business unit the financing business segment offers lease financing solutions to corporations and governmental entities nationwide 
the financing business unit derives revenue from leasing primarily information technology equipment and sales of leased equipment 
these revenues are reflected under lease revenues and sales of leased equipment on our consolidated statements of operations 
lease revenues consist of rentals due under operating leases  amortization of unearned income on direct financing and sales type leases  sales of leased assets to lessees and other post term lease revenue 
the types of revenue and costs recognized by us are determined by each lease contract s individual classification 
each lease is classified as either a direct financing lease  sales type lease  or operating lease  as appropriate 
for direct financing and sales type leases  we record the net investment in leases  which consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments  initial direct costs direct financing leases only  and unguaranteed residual value gross investment less the unearned income 
the unearned income is amortized over the life of the lease using the interest method 
under sales type leases  the difference between the fair value and cost of the leased property plus initial direct costs net margins is recorded as revenue at the inception of the lease 
for operating leases  rental amounts are accrued on a straight line basis over the lease term and are recognized as lease revenue 
in some direct financing lease transactions  where the non recourse debt associated with the lease may be assigned to a lender  and the transfer of financial assets in these transactions meet the criteria for surrender of control  the net amount of the lease and non recourse debt  if any  is accounted for as a sale for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents sales of leased equipment represent revenue from the sales to a third party other than the lessee of equipment subject to a lease in which we are the lessor 
such sales of equipment may have the effect of increasing revenues and net income during the quarter in which the sale occurs  and reducing revenues and net income otherwise expected in subsequent quarters 
if the rental stream on such lease has non recourse debt associated with it  sales revenue is recorded at the amount of consideration received  net of the amount of debt assumed by the purchaser 
if there is no non recourse debt associated with the rental stream  sales revenue is recorded at the amount of gross consideration received  and costs of sales is recorded at the book value of the lease 
fluctuations in revenues our results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  customer demand for our products and services  supplier costs  interest rate fluctuations  and differences between estimated residual values and actual amounts realized related to the equipment we lease 
operating results could also fluctuate as a result of the sale of equipment in our lease portfolio prior to the expiration of the lease term to the lessee or to a third party and changes in incentive programs provided by manufacturers 
we have expanded our product and service offerings under our comprehensive set of solutions which represents the continued evolution of our original implementation of our e commerce products entitled eplussuite 
the expansion to our bundled solution is a framework that combines our it sales and professional services  leasing and financing services  asset management software and services  procurement software  and electronic catalog content management software and services 
we expect to expand or open new sales locations and hire additional staff for specific targeted market areas in the near future whenever we can find both experienced personnel and desirable geographic areas

the fasb accounting standards codification codification established the codification as the source of authoritative us gaap  recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead  it will issue accounting standards updates 
the fasb will not consider accounting standards updates as authoritative in their own right  these updates will serve only to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance  and provide bases for conclusions on the change s in the codification 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  we have updated our disclosures and consolidated financial statements to reflect the new codification 
in the description of the codification and accounting standards updates throughout the report  references in italics relate to codification topics and subtopics  and their descriptive titles  as appropriate 
in december  the fasb issued an update to amend subsequent events in the codification that requires an sec filer and conduit debt obligor to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued 
all other entities are required to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are available to be issued 
in addition  sec filers are exempt from disclosing the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
this update is effective immediately for us for financial statements that are issued or revised 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued an update to amend transfers and servicing in the codification 
this update removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and clarifies the determination of whether a transferor and all of the entities included in the transferor s financial statements being presented have surrendered control over the transferred financial assets 
that determination must consider the transferor s continuing involvement in the transferred financial asset  including all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with  or in contemplation of  the transfer  even if they were not entered into at the time of the transfer 
this update will be effective for us beginning april  we are currently evaluating the future impact this update will have on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued an update to amend revenue recognition in the codification 
this update removes the fair value criterion from the separation criteria that we use to determine whether a multiple deliverable arrangement involves more than one unit of accounting 
it also replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurements required under fair value measurements and disclosures in the codification  provides a hierarchy that entities must use to estimate the selling price  eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation  and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements 
this update is effective for us beginning april  and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
early application is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the timing and the effect that adoption of this update will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
concurrently to issuing the above update  the fasb also issued another update to the codification that excludes certain software from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance 
if software is contained in a tangible product and is essential to the tangible product s functionality  the software and the tangible product can be accounted for as a multiple deliverable arrangement under revenue recognition 
this update is effective for us beginning april  and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
early application is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the timing and the effect that adoption of this update will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued an update to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update requires new disclosures of transfers in and out of levels and and of activity in level fair value measurements 
the update also clarifies the existing disclosures for levels of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques 
this update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the timing and the effect that adoption of this update will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different assumptions were made  it is possible that alternative accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in a change in financial results 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  residuals  vendor consideration  lease classification  goodwill and intangibles  reserves for credit losses and income taxes specifically relating to uncertain tax positions 
estimates in the assumptions used in the valuation of our share based compensation expense are updated periodically and reflect conditions that existed at the time of each new issuance of equity based compensation 
we base estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and therefore  these estimates may require adjustment 
we consider the following accounting policies important in understanding the potential impact of our judgments and estimates on our operating results and financial condition 
for additional accounting policies  see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenues are derived from three sources sales of products and services  lease revenues and sales of our software 
our revenue recognition policies vary based upon these revenue sources 
generally  sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
using these tests  the vast majority of our product sales are recognized upon delivery due to our sales terms with our customers and with our vendors 
for proper cutoff  we estimate the product delivered to our customers at the end of each quarter based upon historical delivery dates 

table of contents we also sell services that are performed in conjunction with product sales  and recognize revenue only when the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and delivery of the undelivered item s is probable and substantially under our control 
for most of the arrangements with multiple deliverables hardware and services  we generally cannot establish reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
therefore  the majority of revenue from these services and hardware sold in conjunction with the services  is recognized when the service is complete and we have received an acceptance certificate 
however  in some cases  we do not receive an acceptance certificate and we estimate the completion date based upon our records 
residual values 
residual values represent our estimated value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
the residual values for direct financing and sales type leases are included as part of the investment in direct financing and sales type leases 
the residual values for operating leases are included in the leased equipment s net book value and are reported in the investment in leases and leased equipment net 
our estimated residual values will vary  both in amount and as a percentage of the original equipment cost  and depend upon several factors  including the equipment type  manufacturer s discount  market conditions and the term of the lease 
in some cases  we obtain third party appraisals of the residual values 
we evaluate residual values on a quarterly basis and record any required impairments of residual value  in the period in which the impairment is determined 
residual values may be affected by equipment supply and demand and by new product announcements by manufacturers 
we seek to realize the estimated residual value at lease termination mainly through renewal or extension of the original lease  or the sale of the equipment either to the lessee or on the secondary market 
the difference between the proceeds of a sale and the remaining estimated residual value is recorded as a gain or loss in lease revenues when title is transferred to the lessee  or  if the equipment is sold on the secondary market  in sales of product and services and cost of sales  product and services when title is transferred to the buyer 
assumptions related to goodwill 
we have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations are based on significant estimates provided by us  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments 
changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently  if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have reportable segments based on the product and services offered financing business segment and technology sales business segment 
below our reportable segments are reporting units 
for the purpose of testing for impairment  we have four distinct reporting units leasing  technology  software procurement and software document management 
in determining reporting units  we consider factors such as nature of products  nature of production  type of customer  management and the availability of separate and distinct financial statements for each entity 
we do not have any goodwill remaining in our software procurement and leasing reporting unit 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents annual test during the third quarter of our fiscal year  we perform our annual goodwill impairment test 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  including prices for similar assets and liabilities and other valuation techniques 
we employed both the market approach and the income approach to determine fair value 
the market approach measures the value of an entity through an analysis of recent sales or by comparison to comparable companies 
the income approach measures the value of reporting units by discounting expected future cash flows 
consideration was given to applying the transaction method which examines sales of stock of private or public companies  which are in the same industry or similar lines of business and are of comparable size and capital structure 
however  we concluded that there were insufficient transactions of similar firms with available current financial information to make a valid comparison 
under the market approach  we used the guideline public company method whereby valuation multiples of guideline companies were applied to the historical financial data of our reporting units 
we analyzed companies that were in the same industry  performed the same or similar services  had similar operations  and are considered competitors 
in addition  the majority of the companies selected were also used in the impairment test performed last year 
multiples that related to some level of earnings or cash flow were most appropriate for the industry in which we operate 
the multiples selected were based on our analysis of the guideline companies profitability ratios and return to investors 
we compared the reporting units size and ranking against the guidelines  taking into consideration risk  profitability and growth along with guideline medians and averages 
we then selected pricing multiples  adjusted appropriately for size and risk  to apply to the reporting unit s trailing twelve month financial data 
multiples were weighted based on the consistency and comparability of the guideline companies along with the respective reporting units  including margins  profitability and leverage 
for each of the reporting units  we used the following multiples the price to earnings before tax ebt  price to net income ni  market value of invested capital mvic to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and mvic to earnings before interest and taxes ebit 
under the income approach  we used the discounted future cash flow method to estimate the fair value of each of the reporting units by discounting the expected future cash flows of reporting units 
we used the weighted average cost of capital to discount the expected future cash flows for the reporting unit to its present value 
the weighted average cost of capital is the estimated rate of return on alternative investments with comparable risks 
the weighted average cost of capital involves estimating the cost of debt and the cost of equity 
in addition  we also considered factors such as risk free rate of return  market equity risk premium  beta coefficient and firm specific risk 
we estimated our weighted average cost of capital at  and for the leasing  technology and software document management reporting units  respectively 
in addition  we estimated the average annual compound cash flow growth rate for a five year period of  and  for the leasing  technology  and software document management reporting units 
also  we estimated a long term growth rate for the leasing reporting unit of  and a long term growth rate for both the technology and software document management reporting units 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is dependent on several significant assumptions involving our forecasted cash flows and weighted average cost of capital 
the forecasted cash flows are based on management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including business plans  growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
any adverse change including a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or slower growth rates may impact our ability to meet our forecasted cash flow estimates 
we averaged the results of the income and market methods and compared the estimated fair value to our market capitalization which was computed by multiplying our closing stock price to the shares outstanding on october  comparison of the average fair values of the reporting units to the overall market value of our equity indicated an implied control premium of 
this percentage falls within the range of currently observable market data 

table of contents during the third quarter when preparing our annual impairment test  the us economy and the global credit crisis weakened the demand for leasing 
as a result of this reduced demand and a reduction in our overall portfolio from prior sales of tranches of leases in our portfolio  we projected a temporary decline in revenue in our leasing reporting unit  which lowered the fair value estimates of the reporting unit 
the result of averaging the estimated fair value computed using the guideline public company and the discounted cash flow methods was that the fair value of the leasing reporting was below its carrying value 
as a result  during the three months ended december   we recorded an estimated impairment charge of million in our leasing reporting unit 
this represented the full amount of goodwill recorded for the leasing reporting unit 
we believed that after assigning the fair value of the leasing reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities  during the second step of the goodwill testing  there would be not be any excess fair value over the amounts assigned to allocate to goodwill 
therefore  the leasing reporting unit s goodwill was fully impaired at october  the technology and software document management reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying values 
had the fair value been lower than calculated on each of the three reporting units  the results would not have changed for any of the reporting units 
the fair value of the technology reporting unit was higher than the carrying value and the fair value of the software document management reporting unit was higher than the carrying value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test in accordance with codification topic intangibles goodwill and other 
based on this analysis  no additional impairment was recorded 
we did not have any triggering events between our annual test date and march  we have million and million of goodwill remaining in our technology and software document management reporting units  respectively 
vendor consideration 
we receive payments and credits from vendors  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs 
many of these programs extend over one or more quarter s sales activities and are primarily formula based 
different programs have different vendor program specific goals to achieve 
these programs can be very complex to calculate and sometimes involves estimates 
based on historical financial data for the different programs  we may estimate that we will obtain these goals 
vendor consideration received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales  product and services on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
vendor consideration received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated to inventories based on the applicable incentives from each vendor and is recorded in cost of sales  product and services  as the inventory is sold 
vendor consideration received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place only if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs 
consideration that exceeds the specific  incremental  identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of cost of sales  product and services on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we accrue vendor consideration in accordance with the terms of the related program which may include a certain amount of sales of qualifying products or as targets are met or as the amounts are estimable and probable or as services are provided 
actual vendor consideration amounts may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued  and can  at times  result in significant earnings fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
reserves for credit losses 
the reserves for credit losses are maintained at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in our lease and accounts receivable portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based on an evaluation of historical credit loss experience  current economic conditions  volume  growth  the composition of the lease portfolio and other relevant factors 
these determinations require considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate potential for collection of these receivables and include giving consideration to the customer s financial condition and the value of the underlying collateral and funding status ie funded on a non recourse or recourse basis 

table of contents sales returns allowance 
the allowance for sales returns is maintained at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential sales returns from product and services 
management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based on an evaluation of historical sales returns and other relevant factors 
these determinations require considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate potential for sales returns and include consideration of the type and volume of product sold 
income tax 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must analyze income tax reserves  as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves considering uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
share based payment 
we currently have two equity incentive plans which provide us with the opportunity to compensate directors with restricted stock and selected employees with stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
a stock option entitles the recipient to purchase shares of common stock from us at the specified exercise price 
restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus entitle the recipient to obtain stock or stock units  which vest over a set period of time 
rsus are granted at no cost to the employee and employees do not need to pay an exercise price to obtain the underlying common stock 
all grants or awards made under the plans are governed by written agreements between us and the participants 
we also have options outstanding under three previous incentive plans  under which we no longer issue equity awards 
under the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  we measure stock option expense at the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model and amortize the compensation expenses using the straight line method over the requisite service period 
this model estimates the fair value of the options based on a number of assumptions  such as interest rates  employee exercises  the current price and expected volatility of our common stock and expected dividends  if any 
the expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk free interest rate  volatility and dividend yield must be applied 
the expected life is the average length of time in which we expect our employees to exercise their options 
the risk free interest rate is the five year nominal constant maturity treasury rate on the date of the award 
expected stock volatility reflects movements in our stock price over a historical period that matches the expected life of the options 
the dividend yield assumption is zero since we have historically not paid any dividends and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future 
results of operations the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  revenues total revenues 
we generated total revenues during the year ended march  of million  compared to revenues of million for the year ended march   a decrease of 
sales of product and services 
sales of product and services decreased to million during the year ended march   compared to million during last fiscal year 
during the first half of fiscal  the economic downturn resulted in our customers tendency to postpone technology equipment investments 
however  we have had sequential growth in sales of product and services for the past four quarters 
sales of product and services increased from fourth quarter fiscal to first quarter  from first to second quarter  from second to third quarter and from third to fourth quarter of fiscal year sales of product and services represented and of total revenue during the year ended march  and  respectively 

table of contents at march   our open orders from customers increased approximately million over last year 
this increase was a result of increased orders from customers towards the later part of the quarter ended march   as well as orders that were not fulfilled by our vendors in their normal time frames 
in addition  we had deferred revenue of million  an increase of approximately million at march   as compared to march   related to bundled hardware and service arrangements that were not completed by the end of the quarter 
we will recognize revenue on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements when the services are completed 
gross margin 
we realized a gross margin on sales of product and services of and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
our gross margin on sales of product and services was affected by an increase in incentives provided to us by our vendors 
in addition  our gross margin was also affected by our customers investment in technology equipment and the mix and volume of product and services sold 
there are ongoing changes to the programs offered to us by our vendors which may be affected by the current economic conditions and thus  we may not be able to maintain the level of manufacturer incentives we currently are receiving  which may cause gross margins to decrease 
lease revenues 
lease revenues can be broadly categorized into two types income generated from the lease portfolio  including income from direct financing leases and rent from operating leases  and other lease related income  including lease sales  sales of leased assets to lessees and end of term income 
lease revenues decreased million  or to million for the year ended march   compared to million during the prior year 
earnings from direct financing and operating leases during the leases original or extended terms decreased about million as compared to same period last year as a result of a smaller lease portfolio throughout the year 
at march   we had million of investment in leases compared to million last year 
a large portion of the increase over last year occurred late in the fourth quarter  and therefore  these leases were not generating earnings for us throughout the year 
partially offsetting the decrease in lease revenue was the sales of lease assets to lessee  which increased about million to million for the year ended march  these purchases by lessees fluctuate primarily based upon portfolio maturity dates and amounts 
other components of lease revenue including sales of leases and income related to end of lease transactions also decreased about million as compared to the same period last year 
sales of leased equipment 
we also recognize revenue from the sale of leased equipment to non lessee third parties 
sales of leased equipment are proceeds from the sales of leased assets and underlying leases to non lessee third parties 
sales of leased equipment fluctuate from quarter to quarter because management determines the timing of such sales as a component of our risk mitigation process  which we conduct periodically to diversify our portfolio by customer  equipment type  and residual value investments 
during the year ended march   sales of leased equipment increased to million  compared to million during the prior year 
gross margins recognized on the sales of leased equipment are and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the revenue and gross margin recognized on sales of leased equipment can vary significantly depending on the nature and timing of the sale 
fee and other income 
for the year ended march   fee and other income decreased to million  compared to million during the prior year 
these decreases were primarily driven by decreases in software and related consulting revenue  decreases in fee income in our leasing segment driven by a decrease in remarketing income and litigation related recoveries  agent fees from manufacturers and short term investment income for the year ended march  fee and other income may also include revenues from adjunct services and fees  including broker and agent fees  support fees  warranty reimbursements  monetary settlements arising from disputes and litigation and interest income 
our fee and other income contains earnings from certain transactions that are infrequent  and there is no guarantee that future transactions of the same nature  size or profitability will occur 
our ability to consummate such transactions  and the timing thereof  may depend largely upon factors outside the direct control of management 
the earnings from these types of transactions in a particular period may not be indicative of the earnings that can be expected in future periods 
patent license and settlement income 
during the year ended march   we entered into settlement and license agreements with three defendants wherein the complaint was dismissed with prejudice and each defendant was granted a license in specified eplus patents  which resulted in payments totaling million 

table of contents these settlement agreements were the result of a lawsuit filed against four defendants alleging that they used or sold products  methods  processes  services and or systems that infringe on certain of our patents 
one such agreement includes an additional payment of thousand due on or before october  this payment has not been recognized in our consolidated statement of operations because collectability is not reasonably assured 
the earnings from these types of transactions in a particular period may not be indicative of the earnings that can be expected in future periods 
costs and expenses cost of sales 
during the year ended march   cost of sales  product and services decreased to million  compared to million during the prior year 
this decrease corresponded to the decrease in sales of product and services in our technology sales business unit 
cost of sales  products and services is also affected by incentives from manufacturers  product mix and volume 
cost of sales  leased equipment increased to million during the year ended march   compared to million for the year ended march  cost of sales  leased equipment is the net book value of the leased assets recorded at the time of the sale 
this increase corresponds to the increase in sales of leased equipment to non lessee third parties in our financing business segment 
direct lease costs 
during the year ended march   direct lease costs decreased to million as compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
the largest component of direct lease costs is depreciation expense for operating lease equipment 
our investment in operating leases decreased to million at march  compared to million at march  primarily due to the sale of a number of lease schedules in the prior fiscal year and a reduction in the origination of operating leases 
professional and other fees 
during the year ended march   professional and other fees increased to million  compared to million during the prior year 
these increases are primarily due to increased legal expense related to the patent infringement litigation  partially offset by lower fees pertaining to our financial statement audit during the same periods last year 
these types of patent infringement cases are complex in nature  are likely to have significant expenses associated with them  and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in our claims for damages  whether any award ultimately received will exceed the costs incurred to pursue these matters  or how long it will take to bring these matters to resolution 
salaries and benefits 
during the year ended march   salaries and benefits expense decreased to million  compared to million during the prior year 
we employed people at march  as compared to people at march  this decrease is driven by lower salaries  benefits and commission expenses  partially offset by increases in share based compensation expense and certain incentive bonuses compared to prior year 
we also provide our employees with a contributory k profit sharing plan 
employer contribution percentages are determined by us and are discretionary each year 
the employer contributions vest pro ratably over a four year service period by the employees  after which  all employer contributions will be fully vested 
for the year ended march  and  our expenses for the plan were approximately thousand and thousand  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended march   general and administrative expenses decreased to million  as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
these decreases are driven by lower expenses in insurance  depreciation  travel and supplies  partially offset by increases in certain telephone and data expenses and software licenses 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs decreased to million during the year ended march   as compared to million during the prior year 
this decrease is primarily driven by lower interest costs and related expenses as a result of lower non recourse note balances 
non recourse notes payable decreased to million at march  as compared to million at march  income taxes 
our provision for income taxes decreased million to million for the year ended march  our effective income tax rates for the years ended march  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in effective income tax rate is due to a reduction in state income tax  and state and foreign tax valuation allowance  partially offset by an increase in non deductible compensation expense 

table of contents net earnings 
the foregoing resulted in net earnings of million for the year ended march   a decrease of as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
basic and fully diluted earnings per common share were and  respectively  for the year ended march  basic and fully diluted earnings per common share were and  respectively  for the year ended march  weighted average common shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended march  were  and  respectively 
weighted average common shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended march  were  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds from operations  and borrowings  both non recourse and recourse 
we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements  which have historically consisted primarily of working capital for operational needs  capital expenditures  purchases of operating lease equipment  payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding  acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
our subsidiary eplus technology  inc  part of our technology sales business segment  finances its operations with funds generated from operations  and with a credit facility with gecdf  which is described in more detail below 
there are two components of this facility a floor plan component  and an accounts receivable component 
after a customer places a purchase order with us and we have completed our credit check  we place an order for the equipment with one of our vendors 
generally  most purchase orders from us to our vendors are first financed under the floor plan component and reflected in accounts payable floor plan on our consolidated balance sheets 
payments on the floor plan component are due on three specified dates each month  generally days from the invoice date 
at each due date  the payment is made by the accounts receivable component of our facility and reflected as recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets 
the borrowings and repayments under the floor plan component are reflected as net borrowings repayments on floor plan facility in the cash flows from financing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
most customer payments in our technology sales business segment are paid to our lockboxes 
once payments are cleared  the monies in the lockbox accounts are automatically transferred to our operating account on a daily basis 
on the due dates of the floor plan component  we make cash payments to gecdf 
these payments from the accounts receivable component to the floor plan component and repayments from our cash are reflected as net borrowings repayments on recourse lines of credit in the cash flows from the financing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we engage in this payment structure in order to minimize our interest expense and bank fees in connection with financing the operations of our technology sales business segment 
we believe that cash on hand  and funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital  capital expenditures and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months 
our ability to continue to fund our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while at this time we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund operations  if demand for it products further declines  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected 
given the current environment within the global financial markets  management has maintained higher cash reserves to ensure adequate cash is available to fund our working capital requirements should the availability to the debt and equity markets be limited 

table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated in thousands year ended march  net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operating activities totaled million in the year ended march   compared to cash provided by operations of million during the prior fiscal year 
cash flows used in operations for the year ended march  resulted primarily from million in cash used by investment in direct financing and sales type leases net 
our investment in direct financing and sales type leases net increased million on our consolidated balance sheets see note  investment in leases and leased equipment net  during the year ended march  the schedule of non cash investing and financing activities contained repayments of million in principal payments by our lessees directly to our lenders for certain leases secured by non recourse debt 
this direct repayment from our lessees directly to our lenders is not reflected in our cash used in operating activities and hence  had the effect of increasing our cash used in operating activities 
in addition  there was an increase in accounts receivable that resulted in cash used in operating activities of million 
the increase in accounts receivable is consistent with the increase in sales of product and services from fourth quarter of fiscal year over the previous fourth quarter of fiscal sales of product and services increased about from million during the fourth quarter of to million during the fourth quarter of the effect of the increase in sales of product and services on accounts receivable is partially offset by an increase in collection during the fourth quarter of fiscal these changes are partially offset by favorable changes in balances of accounts payable equipment and depreciation and amortization expenses 
accounts payable equipment increased approximately million at march  compared to last year 
this increase is related to the purchase of equipment for lease during the month of march 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities increased to million during the year ended march   as compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily driven by cash used in purchases of operating lease equipment of million  partially offset by proceeds from sale or disposal of operating lease equipment of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended march   mostly driven by borrowings of non recourse notes payable for our leasing segment and borrowings from our floor plan facility 
the schedule of non cash investing and financing activities contained a repayment of million in principal payments by our lessees directly to our lenders for certain leases secured by non recourse debt 
this repayment from our lessees directly to our lenders is not reflected in our cash provided by financing activities and hence  had the effect of decreasing our cash used in repayment of non recourse debt 
in addition  we generated million from proceeds from the issuance of capital stock as a result of stock option exercises 
these changes are partially offset by our repayments of non recourse debt of million and repurchases of common stock of million 
compared to the same period last year  cash provided by financing activities decreased million primarily as a result of a net decrease of million from borrowings of non recourse debt and floor plan facility 
liquidity and capital resources non recourse debt financing activities may provide approximately to of the purchase price of the equipment we purchase for leases to our customers 
any balance of the purchase price remaining after non recourse funding and any upfront payments received from the lessee our equity investment in the equipment must generally be financed by cash flows from our operations  the sale of the equipment leased to third parties  or other internal means 
although we expect that the credit quality of our leases and our residual return history will continue to allow us to obtain such financing  such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents the financing necessary to support our leasing activities has principally been provided by non recourse borrowings 
given the current market  we have been monitoring our exposure closely and conserving our capital 
historically  we have obtained recourse and non recourse borrowings from banks and finance companies 
we continue to be able to obtain financing through our traditional lending sources  however  pricing has increased and has become more volatile 
non recourse financings are loans whose repayment is the responsibility of a specific customer  although we may make representations and warranties to the lender regarding the specific contract or have ongoing loan servicing obligations 
under a non recourse loan  we borrow from a lender an amount based on the present value of the contractually committed lease payments under the lease at a fixed rate of interest  and the lender secures a lien on the financed assets 
when the lender is fully repaid from the lease payment  the lien is released and all further rental or sale proceeds are ours 
we are not liable for the repayment of non recourse loans unless we breach our representations and warranties in the loan agreements 
the lender assumes the credit risk of each lease  and the lender s only recourse  upon default by the lessee  is against the lessee and the specific equipment under lease 
at march   our lease related non recourse debt portfolio decreased to million  as compared to million at march whenever possible and desirable  we arrange for equity investment financing  which includes selling assets  including the residual portions  to third parties and financing the equity investment on a non recourse basis 
we generally retain customer control and operational services  and have minimal residual risk 
we usually reserve the right to share in remarketing proceeds of the equipment on a subordinated basis after the investor has received an agreed to return on its investment 
accrued expenses and other liabilities includes deferred expenses  deferred revenue and amounts collected and payable  such as sales taxes and lease rental payments due to third parties 
we had million and million of accrued expenses and other liabilities as of march  and march   respectively  an increase of 
the increase is primarily driven by approximately million increase in deferred revenue related to bundled hardware and service arrangements that were not completed by the end of the quarter

and is secured by a blanket lien against all its assets  such as chattel paper  receivables and inventory 
as of march   the facility had an aggregate limit of the two components of million with an accounts receivable sub limit of million 
availability under the gecdf facility may be limited by the asset value of equipment we purchase and the aging of our accounts receivable and may be further limited by certain covenants and terms and conditions of the facility 
these covenants include but are not limited to a minimum total tangible net worth and subordinated debt of eplus technology  inc  and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio of eplus technology  inc 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of march  in addition  the facility restricts the ability of eplus technology  inc 
to transfer funds to its affiliates in the form of dividends  loans or advances  however  we do not expect these restrictions to have an impact on the ability of eplus inc 
to meet its cash obligations or materially restrict its ability to undertake additional debt or equity financing 
either party may terminate with days advance notice 
we are not  and do not believe that we are reasonably likely to be  in breach of gecdf credit facility 
in addition  we do not believe that the covenants of the gecdf credit facility materially limit our ability to undertake financing 
in this regard  the covenants apply only to our subsidiary  eplus technology  inc 
this credit facility is secured by the assets of only eplus technology  inc 
and the guaranty as described below

the guaranty requires eplus inc 
to deliver its audited financial statements by certain dates 
we have delivered the annual audited financial statements for the year ended march  as required 
the loss of the gecdf credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we currently rely on this facility and its components for daily working capital and liquidity for our technology sales business and as an operational function of our accounts payable process 
in light of the credit market conditions  we continue to have discussions with gecdf to inquire about the strategic focus of their distribution finance unit 
pursuant to these discussions  we believe that we can continue to rely on the availability of this credit facility 
should the gecdf credit facility no longer be available  we believe we can increase our lines of credit with our vendors and utilize our cash for working capital

in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations 
we are in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee  and we believe that any liability incurred in connection with these guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

table of contents adequacy of capital resources the continued implementation of our business strategy will require a significant investment in both resources and managerial focus 
in addition  we may selectively acquire other companies that have attractive customer relationships and skilled sales forces 
we may also acquire technology companies to expand and enhance the platform of bundled solutions to provide additional functionality and value added services 
as a result  we may require additional financing to fund our strategy  implementation and potential future acquisitions  which may include additional debt and equity financing 
for the periods presented herein  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although a substantial portion of our liabilities are non recourse  fixed interest rate instruments  we utilize our lines of credit and other financing facilities which are subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
these instruments  which are denominated in us dollars  were entered into for other than trading purposes and  with the exception of amounts drawn under the gecdf facility  bear interest at a fixed rate 
because the interest rate on these instruments is fixed  changes in interest rates will not directly impact our cash flows 
borrowings under the gecdf facility bear interest at a market based variable rate 
as of march   the aggregate fair value of our recourse borrowings approximated their carrying value 
during the year ended march   we began transacting business in canada 
as such  we have entered into lease contracts and non recourse  fixed interest rate financing denominated in canadian dollars 
to date  canadian operations have been insignificant and we believe that potential fluctuations in currency exchange rates will not have a material effect on our financial position 
we also have leasing transactions in iceland 
to date  icelandic operations have been insignificant and we believe that potential fluctuations in icelandic krona currency exchange rates will not have a material effect on our financial position
