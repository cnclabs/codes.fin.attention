item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those matters discussed under the heading forward looking statements  above 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is used for transistor level  or front end of line manufacturing  and also in specialized applications for processing the interconnect layer  or back end of line processing 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
because the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment is also highly cyclical 
the semiconductor equipment industry is typically characterized by wide swings in operating results as the industry moves through its cycle 
the latest downturn in the industry  which began in the second half of fiscal  has been unusually severe and extreme due to the global economic crisis 
however  based on recent trends  we believe that the semiconductor equipment market is recovering at a faster rate than was anticipated and that a recovery in the industry is commencing 
was a challenging year for the industry  with an unprecedented downturn in the cycle 
however  building on a history of innovation  mattson continued to fund our new product portfolio  the development of which allows us to target markets we did not previously serve  increasing our market opportunity 
in  we strengthened our restructuring and cost reduction efforts and increased our efforts to outsource the manufacturing of our products 
our goal with respect to these initiatives is to yield higher returns as we grow into a larger targeted available market  and we believe we have positioned mattson to improve our results with any sustained recovery of the economy and the industry 
we believe that our strategic investment in the etch market is yielding results 
we leveraged our plasma expertise into the etch market  an entirely new sector for the company 
as a result  we enter positioned to serve customers in three diverse markets sectors  thereby increasing our addressable market 
we have recently announced our latest etch system  the paradigme  which is our newest advanced innovation targeted to meet the stringent requirements of advanced dielectric etch applications 
we are increasing product traction with key customer wins with this product 
the paradigme and the alpine comprise our etch portfolio  and together they have had key placements in the memory and foundry sectors for both front end of line and back end interconnect usages 
during  etch became a revenue contributor  making up over percent of our revenue 
we recognized revenue on an alpine system with a leading logic manufacturer for wafer level packaging applications  which opened up a new addressable market 
we extended rtp into the logic and foundry sectors 
we released our next generation rtp system  the helios xp  which is gaining significant traction with our customers 
we shipped a system to a leading foundry customer for advanced anneal processing  and the helios xp is now established at multiple leading customers in the memory and foundry sectors 
our suprema product continued to extend our application positions into our key accounts 
as we move further into  we are beginning to see capacity buys in strip and we expect our core business to increase revenue levels as the wafer fabrication capital spending increases with the recovery 
we believe that we are positioned at leading customers with strong balance sheets and the requisite resources to fully leverage these positions for improvements in our results with the strengthening of the global economy 
in  our revenue declined by million to million from million in  primarily due to significant weakness in the semiconductor equipment market  exacerbated by the global economic crisis 
gross profit in was a negative million compared to million in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower revenues across all product lines  factory under utilization charges and higher inventory write downs 
our operating expenses in decreased by percent to million 
the decrease in operating expenses was largely due to stringent cost reduction measures we implemented in and the impact of the cost reduction measures  non recurrence of certain impairment charges that were recognized in  and realization of a tax benefit contributed to a lower net loss in of million compared to million in as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
we had no debt outstanding as of december  with our current cash position  we believe we have sufficient resources to meet our requirements for the next year  subject to the expected continuing improvement in the overall economy and the semiconductor equipment industry 
going forward  the success of our business will be dependent on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for semiconductors and semiconductor wafer processing equipment 
such factors will also include our ability to a significantly grow the company  either organically or through acquisitions  in order to enhance our competitiveness and profitability  b develop and bring to market new products that address our customers needs  c grow customer loyalty through collaboration with and support of our customers  d maintain a cost structure that will enable us to operate effectively and profitably throughout changing industry cycles and e generate the gross profits necessary to enable us to make the necessary investments in our business 
results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease net sales    cost of sales  gross profit loss  operating expenses research  development and engineering  selling  general and administrative   amortization of intangibles n m restructuring charges   impairment of goodwill   n m impairment of intangibles and long lived assets n m total operating expenses  loss from operations   interest income   interest expense other income expense  net  n m loss before income taxes   provision for benefit from income taxes  n m net loss  not meaningful net sales 
net sales decreased by percent to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the overall decline in net sales was comprised of a percent decrease in product revenue  and a percent decrease in spares parts and services revenues 
in  we received our final royalty payment of million from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit against dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd dns 
the decline in our net sales was primarily due to the severity of the continued downturn in the overall wafer fabrication equipment market  the industry s reduced capital spending  and excess supplies at our customers fabs 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a percent sequential revenue growth over the last quarter and we experienced more than percent incremental revenue growth over the last three quarters  as we believe the semiconductor equipment market is in the beginning phases of a recovery 
in  international sales to customers in europe and asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan continued to account for a significant portion of our total net sales  comprising approximately percent of net sales in  compared to percent in we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin 
gross profit was a negative million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to million in the decrease in gross profit was primarily caused by the percent decrease in net sales in in addition  the decrease in our production levels resulted in under absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs of approximately million combined with million of excess inventory reserves due to lower forecasted revenue volumes and million for excess inventory reserves resulting from vendor commitments 
royalty revenue  with no offsetting costs  of million from dns favorably impacted the gross margin in gross profit margin for the year ended december  decreased to a negative percent from percent in  primarily due to under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by lower production levels as well as additional inventory reserves 
our gross profit margin has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  inventory reserves  economies of scale  material and other costs  overhead absorption levels and the timing of revenue recognition 
research  development and engineering rd e 
rd e expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or percent compared to million in the decrease in rd e expenses was primarily comprised of a million reduction in salaries and other employee costs  a million reduction in project material expenditures  and a combined million reduction in travel and outside service expenses 
these decreases were the result of ongoing cost reduction activities implemented since fiscal  consisting of planned shutdowns  furloughs  workforce reductions and spending reductions in certain rd e projects 
selling  general and administrative sg a 
sg a expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or percent compared to million in the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily comprised of a million net decrease in salaries and other employee costs  a million decrease in outside service expenses  a million decrease in travel expenses  and a million reduction in freight costs 
these decreases in sg a expenses were primarily due to reductions in certain costs attributable to the decrease in revenues and cost reduction activities implemented since fiscal we also released million of bad debt reserves in upon receipt of payments from the customers  when compared to additional bad debt reserves of million in amortization of intangibles 
we recorded amortization expenses of zero and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the remaining carrying amount of purchased technology acquired in connection with our acquisition of vortek in restructuring expenses 
beginning in the second quarter of through the third quarter of  we implemented several restructuring plans in response to declining revenues 
the restructuring initiatives in and resulted in a combined reduction of approximately percent of our workforce and a combined expected annualized cost savings of approximately million 
in connection with the restructuring activities in  we recognized restructuring charges of million  comprised of million in severance costs and million in lease termination costs  and in  we recognized restructuring charges of million  comprised of million in severance costs and million in lease termination costs 
as of december   we had a total restructuring reserves balance of million  comprised of severance costs of million and lease termination costs of million 
we anticipate that severance payments against the reserves will be substantially completed by the end of the first half of fiscal with respect to the lease termination  we are currently engaged in an ongoing negotiation with the landlord  and the payment of the lease termination expense is dependent on the timing of a final agreement with the landlord 
our cost cutting initiatives in both and also included activities that did not result in restructuring charges  such as i better utilization of assets  including focused reduction of existing inventories  ii reduced variable headcount expenses through shutdowns and unpaid time off  and iii cash conservation and spending cuts in travel  outside service  project material and other rd e and sg a related costs 
in  we will continue to review our operations and take further cost reduction measures as necessary  in order to minimize the cash used in operations  and retain sufficient cash reserves for the next twelve months 
impairment of goodwill 
in fiscal  we had no goodwill impairment charges 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining carrying amount of goodwill  as the value of goodwill deteriorated to zero due to the significant declines in our revenues and market capitalization 
impairment of intangibles and long lived assets 
in  we had no impairment charges related to intangibles or long lived assets 
in  we recorded impairment charges to write off intangible assets of million and certain lab assets of million to adjust for the deteriorating value of these assets resulting from the decline in expected cash flows attributable to the assets 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million when compared to million in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash investment balances and lower average interest rate yields during fiscal our average interest yield was percentage points in compared to percentage points in fiscal other income  net was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to an expense of million for the year ended december  the increase in other income  net is primarily due to a net foreign currency exchange gain of million and other income of million for the year ended december   compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of million and other expense of million for the year ended december  the increase in foreign currency gain was due to the significant fluctuation of the us dollar against the foreign currencies in which certain of our accounts receivable and or accounts payable balances were denominated during provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million benefit from the settlement of a german tax audit for the tax years from to  offset by a provision for foreign taxes of million and a provision for federal and state income taxes of million resulting in an overall tax benefit of million 
the provision for income taxes in primarily consisted of a million provision for foreign taxes 
currently  we have provided a full valuation allowance for all jurisdictions except germany as we have determined that  due to uncertainties and other negative evidence in our current operations and our expectations of future operations  it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets generated from net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized 
our provision for income taxes could be favorably impacted going forward if our results of operations and forecasts for future profitability improve sufficiently to indicate that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
such a change in management s expectations could result in a material change to our valuation allowance assessment and the resulting income tax provision 
years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease net sales    cost of sales  gross profit loss  operating expenses research  development and engineering  selling  general and administrative   amortization of intangibles restructuring charges   n m impairment of intangibles   n m impairment of intangibles and long lived assets  n m total operating expenses  income from operations    n m interest income    interest expense n m other income expense  net  n m income before income taxes    n m provision for benefit from income taxes  net income loss  n m not meaningful sales 
net sales decreased by percent to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to significant weakness in the semiconductor equipment market  which resulted in a million decline in systems sales  a million decline in spares and service sales and a million decline in royalty revenue arising from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit against dns 
international sales to customers based in europe and asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan comprised approximately percent of net sales in  compared to percent for the same period in gross profit and gross profit margin 
gross profit was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or percent compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a percent decline in net sales in when compared to  manufacturing under absorption of million in compared to million in  and a million increase in inventory reserves and manufacturing direct costs in compared to million in in the third and fourth quarters of  we reduced manufacturing headcount by approximately percent as a result of restructuring activities 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  decreased to percent from percent in  a decline of percent 
the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels and additional inventory reserves 
research  development and engineering 
rd e expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in rd e was primarily due to an increase of million in higher depreciation on lab tools and million due to lower research and development credits from a research partner 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to million higher receivables provisions  additional amortization of million for evaluation tools at customer sites  a million one time material credit related to reserve releases in against a government funded project  million higher installation expenses related to the evaluation tools at customer sites and million higher expenses arising from market development and selling efforts 
these increases were partially offset by million in reduced payroll expenses arising from restructuring activities  million savings from contract re negotiations and reduced third party services  and million in lower sales commissions and insurance costs 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded amortization expenses of million for each year ended december  and related to purchased technology acquired in connection with our acquisition of vortek in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the remaining carrying amount of this asset as the projected cash flows attributable to the assets were adversely impacted by our declining revenues 
restructuring expenses 
during fiscal  we implemented several restructuring programs in response to our declining revenues  as follows in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a reorganization of our structure to reduce costs of operations and streamline the organization going forward 
we reduced approximately percent of our then global workforce through reductions in force 
we incurred related restructuring charges of million  comprised of severance costs 
in the third quarter of  we implemented a cost alignment plan to reduce headcount and optimize our facilities worldwide 
we reduced percent of our then global workforce  which impacted approximately percent of our manufacturing positions 
we incurred related restructuring charges of million in severance costs and million in lease termination costs 
in the second quarter of  we eliminated approximately percent of our then global workforce  primarily in the office support organizations 
we incurred related restructuring charges of million  comprised of severance costs 
in total  the restructuring activities reduced our headcount by approximately percent and resulted in restructuring charges totaling million  primarily comprised of severance costs 
the estimated annual savings from the restructuring activities were expected to be approximately million 
we had no restructuring charges in fiscal impairment of goodwill 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining carrying amount of goodwill  caused by significant declines in our revenues and market capitalization 
we had no such impairment charge in fiscal impairment of intangibles and long lived assets 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million to write off the net book value of intangible assets and million to write off certain lab assets 
the intangible assets pertained to certain technology acquired from vortek in october of we had no impairment charges in fiscal interest and other income expense  net 
in  interest income decreased by million due to lower cash investment balances in and lower average interest rate yields of percent compared to percent in the million increase in other expense  net in was primarily due to million foreign exchange losses caused by a weakening us dollar in the first half of and one time payments of million received in connection with the termination of two commercial agreements in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in consisted entirely of a million provision for foreign taxes 
the provision for income taxes in consisted primarily of a million provision for federal and state income taxes and a million provision for foreign taxes 
other stock based compensation 
stock based compensation totaled million in  million in  and million in the decrease in stock based compensation in compared to was primarily due to cancellation of stock options in connection with headcount reductions in the second half of and in as of december   unrecognized stock based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows weighted unrecognized share based weighted compensation average cost period in millions in years stock options restricted stock units liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments were million as of december   a decrease of million from million as of december  stockholders equity as of december  was million compared to million as of december  working capital as of december  was million compared to million as of december  credit arrangements in june  our million revolving line of credit expired 
the line of credit was collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets  excluding intellectual property assets 
we used this credit line principally to secure letters of credit  totaling approximately million  provided primarily to certain landlords  and we did not borrow or have outstanding borrowings under this line of credit at any time during its term 
as a replacement for the security that was provided by the expired line of credit  these letters of credit are now secured by cash of million  which is classified as restricted cash as of december  contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table vendor commitments operating lease sub total payments contractor inventory other total commitment thousands thereafter  other vendor commitments primarily include service related contracts and agreements for information technology support  commitments for non inventory purchases of assets  and other service related commitments 
we continue to lease a building that previously housed the administrative functions of our wet surface preparation products in exton  pennsylvania under a noncancelable lease  expiring in december in january  we entered into a sublease agreement for this facility  expiring in december  in october  the lessee entered into an agreement with us to terminate the current sublease agreement as of june  and simultaneously entered into a new agreement to lease approximately percent of the facility until december  cancellable anytime after december  under the existing sublease agreement  we have approximately million of expected future sublease income as of december  our deferred income taxes have been excluded from the table above because the related future cash outflows are uncertain 
as of december   we had approximately million of net unrecognized tax benefits that may be subject to examination by applicable tax authorities 
in connection with the acquisition of vortek industries  ltd vortek in  we became party to an agreement between vortek and the canadian minister of industry the minister pertaining to an investment in vortek by technology partnerships canada 
under the agreement  as amended  mattson technology  inc or vortek renamed mattson technology  canada  inc or mtc agreed to various covenants  including i payment by us of a royalty to the minister of percent of revenues from flash rtp products  up to a total of cad  approximately million based on the applicable exchange rate at december   ii mtc maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in canada through october   iii investment of a certain amount by october  and certain other covenants concerning protection of intellectual property rights and manufacturing obligations 
also  under the provisions of this agreement  if we  or mtc  did not materially satisfy our obligations pursuant to the covenants  the minister could have demanded payment of liquidated damages in the amount of cad  approximately million at december  less any royalties paid by mtc or us to the minister 
as of december   we are no longer subject to covenants ii and iii of this agreement  as discussed above  but we are still subject to covenant i  relating to payment of royalty to the minister until or until the royalty payments reach cad  approximately million as of december  
however  if mtc is dissolved  files for bankruptcy or does not materially comply with certain terms and conditions of the contract prior to its expiration on december   we would be subject to liquidated damages in the amount of cad  approximately million as of december  less any royalties paid by mtc or by us to the minister 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
legal settlement in march  a jury in san jose  california rendered a verdict in favor of our then subsidiary  mattson wet products  inc formally cfm technologies  inc  in a patent infringement suit against dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
dns  a japanese manufacturer of semiconductor wafer processing equipment 
in june  we entered into a settlement agreement and a license agreement with dns  under which dns agreed to make payments to us totaling between million minimum and million maximum for past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney fees and costs and license fees 
through december   dns paid us a total of million under the terms of the settlement and license agreements 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized royalty revenue of million  million and million  respectively  from dns  which are reflected as a components of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations for those years 
dns paid its last royalty payment to us in may  and as of that date  dns had satisfied all of its obligations to us pursuant to the settlement and license agreements 
liquidity and capital resources outlook as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million 
we believe that these balances will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months 
we will continue to review our expected cash requirements  and plan to take appropriate cost reduction measures to ensure that we have at least six to eight quarters of available cash 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in such businesses 
we may use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
these financing options may not be available to us on a timely basis  if at all  or  if available  on terms acceptable to us or not dilutive to our shareholders 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operations was million for the year ended december   comprised of net loss of million  offset by non cash charges totaling million and an increase in cash from a net decrease in assets and liabilities of million 
non cash charges of million consisted of i million in charges related to additional reserves for excess inventory resulting from the decrease in sales and existing vendor commitments  ii million in depreciation charges  iii million in stock based compensation  iv million in charges for other non cash items  offset by v million net tax benefit  primarily consisting of a million reversal of certain foreign deferred tax liabilities and vi million net decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts  resulting from the release of bad debt reserves upon receipt of past due payments from customers 
the decrease in assets and liabilities of million was primarily due to a million net decrease in accounts receivable and advanced billings  a million decrease in inventories and inventories delivered systems  offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and a million decrease in deferred revenue 
the decrease in accounts receivable and deferred revenue are largely reflective of the percent decrease in net sales in the decreases in inventories and inventories delivered systems are the result of our efforts to maximize utilization of available inventory  thereby minimizing cash outlays on new inventories 
the net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from decreasing revenue volumes  lower inventory requirements and purchases  and lower spending resulting from our cost reduction measures 
net cash used in operations was million for the year ended december   primarily comprised of net loss of million and a decline in assets and liabilities of million offset by non cash charges of million 
the decline in net assets of million represented a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million increase in inventories  a million decrease in deferred revenue  and a million decrease in other liabilities  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable and advanced billings  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and a million decrease in other assets 
net cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december   primarily comprised of net income of million  non cash charges of million and a million increase in assets and liabilities 
the increase in net assets of million primarily consisted of a million decrease in accounts receivable and advanced billings  a million increase in other liabilities and a million decrease in inventories delivered systems  offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million increase in inventories  a million decrease in deferred revenue and a million reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts 
cash provided by operations may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our net sales and operating results  amount of revenue deferred  inventory purchases  collection of accounts receivable and timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily consisting of million proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments  offset by million used in the purchases of available for sale investments  purchases of million of certificates of deposit and capital expenditures of million 
the million of certificates of deposit secures standby letters of credit provided to certain landlords and were classified as restricted cash as of december  our capital expenditures were primarily for tools and equipment used in our manufacturing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million and proceeds from sales of fixed assets of million 
capital expenditures in were primarily comprised of purchases of laboratory tools and equipment used in our rd e activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million and proceeds from sales of property and equipment of million  partially offset by purchases of available for sale investments of million and capital spending of million 
our capital expenditures in were primarily comprised of purchases of technology used in our rd e activities 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisted of net proceeds from stock plan transactions 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisted of repurchases of our stock of million  partially offset by net proceeds from stock plans of million 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisted of repurchases of our stock of million  partially offset by net proceeds of million from stock plans 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring  income taxes and stock based compensation as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from these primary sources equipment tool sales  spare part sales and service and maintenance contracts 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition  we recognize revenue on equipment sales as follows i for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for sales of new products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  ii for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which we bifurcate such sale transactions into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
the two elements are the tool and installation 
under this approach  the portion of the invoice price that is due upon shipment  generally percent of the total invoice amount  is recognized as revenue upon shipment and transfer of title  percent of the associated costs is also recognized upon shipment  and the remaining portion  generally percent of the total invoice amount  is recognized once installation services are completed and final customer acceptance of the tool is received 
from time to time  we allow customers to evaluate systems  while maintaining the right to return the systems at their discretion with limited or no penalty 
for this type of arrangement  we do not recognize revenue on the evaluation systems until customer acceptance is received 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
for service and maintenance contracts  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is established based on historical trends  current economic conditions  delinquency status based on contractual terms and an analysis of specific exposures 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  including filing for bankruptcy  or if a customer was unable to make any payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on system sales generally ranges from months to months  depending on the product 
in  we transitioned our warranty period to months for most systems sales  except where previous customer agreements stated otherwise 
in  we also changed the coverage provided by the warranty to exclude certain consumable maintenance items 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of sale when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the equipment or parts 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly 
actual warranty reserves and settlements against reserves are highly dependent on our system volumes  and workforce availability and utilizations 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty costs that we have had in the past 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis  and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
under our general terms of sale  title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
inventory valuation 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
we measure certain of our assets at fair value  using observable market data 
the authoritative guidance on fair value measurement defines fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  and establishes valuation hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of assets or liabilities 
the authoritative guidance also establishes three classes of assets or liabilities level consists of assets and liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets  level consists of assets and liabilities for which observable inputs other than level inputs are used such as prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets and model derived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data  and level consists of assets and liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 
our cash equivalents and investment instruments are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy  as these instruments are valued using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency and transaction value 
we had no assets or liabilities classified within level as of december  goodwill 
we perform a goodwill impairment test annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred 
such events or circumstances may include significant adverse changes in the general business climate  among other things 
the impairment test is performed by determining our fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows and considering the market price of our common stock 
if our carrying value  as a one reporting unit entity  is less than our fair value  then the fair value is allocated to all of our assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if our fair value was the purchase price to acquire us 
the excess of our fair value over the amounts assigned to our assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
based on the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  the weakness in the semiconductor market and significant erosion of our market capitalization during fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing the remaining carrying amount of goodwill as of the date of the impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of december   there was no goodwill on our books 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in  we recorded impairment charges to write off intangible assets of million and certain lab assets of million to adjust for the deteriorating value of these assets resulting from the decline in expected cash flows attributable to the assets 
there were no such impairment charges in  restructuring 
we recognize expenses related to employee termination benefits when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required 
if an employee is required to render service until a specific termination date in order to receive the termination benefits  the fair value of the associated liability would be recognized ratably over the future service period 
the costs of severance are determined by local statutory requirements and our policies 
for some entities  where salaries are paid during the notice period  a portion of the severance reserves would be based on estimates of the ability to find employment during the notice period  and we would determine the reserves in accordance with these estimates 
we recognize the present value of facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income and other exit costs  when we have future lease payments with no future economic benefit 
in future periods  we will record accretion expense to increase the liability to an amount equal to the estimated future cash payments necessary to exit the lease 
this requires a significant amount of judgment and management estimation in order to determine the expected time frame it will take to secure a subtenant  the amount of sublease income to be received and the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future cash flows 
if actual lease exit costs differ from estimates  we would adjust the restructuring charge  which would impact net income in the period any adjustment was recorded 
income taxes 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
for all tax jurisdictions with the exception of our german operations  we recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income and losses  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would change income in the period of the adjustment 
stock based compensation 
we measure the fair value of all stock based awards  including stock options  restricted stock units  and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan  on the date of grant  and we recognize the related stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of certain of our stock based awards 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which includes expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected life of options based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option  expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock  and the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury rates  with maturity approximating the expected life of the option 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future  accordingly  the expected dividend yield is zero 
we estimate forfeiture rates on stock based awards at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
such forfeiture estimates are based on historical experience 
if the assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense change in future periods  the amount of future stock based compensation may differ significantly from the amounts we recorded in the current and prior periods 
stock based compensation expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards codification as the single authoritative source for us gaap  which replaces all previous us gaap accounting standards  beginning in the interim and annual periods ending after september  the new codification standards are promulgated in the fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles  which we adopted in the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this standard only impacted references of accounting standards disclosed in our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks related foreign exchange rates 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates 
our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements 
our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital  maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements  and maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents  and classify our short term investments as available for sale 
our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds  commercial paper  corporate debt securities  and us government and government sponsored debt securities 
our short term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments  realized gains and losses  and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and million in short term investments 
based on the size of investment portfolio as of december   an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  because of the short term nature of our portfolio  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates could harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio in the future as securities mature 
by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments 
as of december   percent of our short term investments mature in less than one year 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currencies 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period  and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred 
because much of our revenues and capital spending are transacted in us dollars  we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows  depending on the strength of the us dollar relative to the currencies of other countries in which we operate 
exchange rate fluctuations of greater than ten percent  primarily for the us dollar relative to the euro or the canadian dollar  could have a material impact on our financial statements 
for the year ended december   realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains were million  compared to realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange losses of million in the increase in foreign currency gain was due to significant fluctuations of the us dollar against certain of the foreign currencies in which we had outstanding accounts receivable and or accounts payable balances as of december  cumulative translation adjustments included in comprehensive income for the year ended december  were million primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar  which favorably impacted the net assets used in our foreign operations and held in local currencies  resulting in an increase in cumulative translation adjustments by million as of december  compared to million as of december  we did not engage in hedging activities during the years ended december  and in fiscal  we used foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations associated with the sales of systems to customers in japan and the revaluation gains losses of foreign denominated accounts receivable 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging transactions  these forward contracts did not qualify as designated hedges  as such  the forward contracts were marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains losses recorded in other income expense  net
