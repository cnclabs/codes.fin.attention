item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations elsewhere in this report 
competition there is significant competition within the banking and financial services industry in the markets in which trustmark operates 
changes in regulation  technology and product delivery systems have resulted in an increasingly competitive environment 
trustmark expects to continue to face increasing competition from online and traditional financial institutions seeking to attract customers by providing access to similar services and products 
trustmark and its subsidiaries compete with national and state chartered banking institutions of comparable or larger size and resources and with smaller community banking organizations 
trustmark has numerous local  regional and national nonbank competitors  including savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  financial service operations of major retailers  investment brokerage and financial advisory firms and mutual fund companies 
because nonbank financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies  they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 
currently  trustmark does not face meaningful competition from international banks in its markets  although that could change in the future 

table of contents the table below presents fdic deposit data regarding tnb s deposit market share by state as of june  market deposit market share mississippi texas tennessee florida services provided by the wealth management segment face competition from many national  regional and local financial institutions 
companies that offer broad services similar to those provided by trustmark  such as other banks  trust companies and full service brokerage firms  as well as companies that specialize in particular services offered by trustmark  such as investment advisors and mutual fund providers  all compete with trustmark s wealth management segment 
trustmark s insurance subsidiaries face competition from local  regional and national insurance companies  independent insurance agencies as well as from other financial institutions offering insurance products 
trustmark s ability to compete effectively is a result of being able to provide customers with desired products and services in a convenient and cost effective manner 
customers for commercial  consumer and mortgage banking as well as wealth management and insurance services are influenced by convenience  quality of service  personal contacts  availability of products and services and related pricing 
trustmark continually reviews its products  locations  alternative delivery channels  and pricing strategies to maintain and enhance its competitive position 
while trustmark s position varies by market  management believes it can compete effectively as a result of local market knowledge and awareness of customer needs 
supervision and regulation the following discussion sets forth certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information relevant to trustmark 
the discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of statutes  regulations and policies that are described 
also  such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under the review of congress and state legislatures as well as federal and state regulatory agencies 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies could have a material impact on the business of trustmark and its subsidiaries 
general trustmark is a registered bank holding company under the bank holding company act bhc of  as amended 
as such  trustmark and its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to the supervision  examination and reporting requirements of the bhc act and the regulations of the federal reserve board 
in addition  as part of federal reserve policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and to maintain resources adequate to support each subsidiary bank 
the bhc act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if  after such acquisition  the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting shares of the bank  ii it or any of its subsidiaries  other than a bank  may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or iii it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company 
the bhc act further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states  or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country  or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade  unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy  and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties performance under the community reinvestment act of the bhc act  as amended by the interstate banking provisions of the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of repealed the prior statutory restrictions on interstate acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies  such that trustmark may now acquire a bank located in any other state  regardless of state law to the contrary  subject to certain deposit percentage  aging requirements  and other restrictions 
the interstate bank branching act also generally provided that  after june   national and state chartered banks may branch interstate through acquisitions of banks in other states 

table of contents in addition  bank holding companies generally may engage  directly or indirectly  only in banking and such other activities as are determined by the federal reserve board to be closely related to banking 
trustmark is also subject to regulation by the state of mississippi under its general business corporation laws 
in addition to the impact of regulation  trustmark and its subsidiaries may be affected by legislation that can change banking statutes in substantial and unexpected ways and by the actions of the federal reserve board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy 
tnb is a national banking association and  as such  is subject to regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the federal reserve board 
almost every area of the operations and financial condition of tnb is subject to extensive regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law including loans  reserves  investments  issuance of securities  establishment of branches  capital adequacy  liquidity  earnings  dividends  management practices and the provision of services 
somerville is a state chartered commercial bank  subject to regulation primarily by the fdic and secondarily by the tennessee department of financial institutions 
tnb s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to a variety of state and federal laws 
tia  a registered investment advisor  is subject to supervision and regulation by the sec and the state of mississippi 
bottrell  fisher brown and trmi are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the states in which they are active 
trustmark is also under the jurisdiction of the sec for matters relating to the offering  sale and trading of its securities 
trustmark is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  as administered by the sec 
the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of act was signed into law on november  as a result of the act  banks are able to offer customers a wide range of financial products and services without the restraints of previous legislation 
in addition  bank holding companies and other financial services providers have been able to commence new activities and develop new affiliations much more readily 
the primary provisions of the act related to the establishment of financial holding companies and financial subsidiaries became effective on march  the act authorizes national banks to own or control a financial subsidiary that engages in activities that are not permissible for national banks to engage in directly 
the act contains a number of provisions dealing with insurance activities by bank subsidiaries 
generally  the act affirms the role of the states in regulating insurance activities  including the insurance activities of financial subsidiaries of banks  but the act also preempts certain state laws 
as a result of the act  tnb elected for bottrell  fisher brown and trmi to become financial subsidiaries 
this enables tnb to engage in insurance agency activities at any location 
the act also imposed new requirements related to the privacy of customer financial information 
in accordance with the act  federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party 
the privacy provisions of the act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
trustmark has complied with these requirements and recognizes the need for its customers privacy 
anti money laundering initiatives and the usa patriot act trustmark is also subject to extensive regulations aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the usa patriot act substantially broadened the scope of united states anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the treasury has issued a number of implementing regulations to financial institutions that apply to various requirements of the usa patriot act 
these regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers 
failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing  or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations  could have serious legal and financial consequences for the institution 
capital adequacy banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and  additionally for banks  prompt corrective action regulations  involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 

table of contents the federal reserve board and the occ  the primary regulators of trustmark and tnb  respectively  have substantially similar risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations 
under the guidelines  banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for tier capital and total capital to risk weighted assets 
for purposes of calculating these ratios  a banking organization s assets and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories 
capital  at both the holding company and bank level  is classified in one of three tiers depending on type 
core capital tier for both trustmark and tnb includes total equity capital  with the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income loss eliminated plus allowable trust preferred securities less goodwill  other identifiable intangible assets and disallowed servicing assets 
supplementary capital tier includes the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations  as well as allowable subordinated debt 
total capital for both trustmark and tnb is a combination of tier and tier capital 
trustmark and tnb are required to maintain tier and total capital equal to at least and of their total risk weighted assets  respectively 
at december   trustmark exceeded both requirements with tier capital and total capital equal to and of its total risk weighted assets  respectively 
at december   tnb also exceeded both requirements with tier capital and total capital equal to and of its total risk weighted assets  respectively 
the federal reserve board also requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum leverage ratio 
the guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for banks and bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority s risk adjusted measure for market risk 
all other holding companies and national banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  unless an appropriate regulatory authority specifies a different minimum ratio 
for tnb to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  its leverage ratio must be at least 
at december   the leverage ratios for trustmark and tnb were and  respectively 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended  fdia  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions 
these include well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
fdia requires banking regulators to take prompt corrective action whenever financial institutions do not meet minimum capital requirements 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a depository institution to capital raising requirements 
in addition  a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions  including paying dividends  or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
as of december   the most recent notification from the occ categorized tnb as well capitalized based on the ratios and guidelines described above 
in addition  fdia requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards 
the minimum risk based capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision 
in  the basel committee published a revision to the accord basel ii and in december  us banking regulators published a final basel ii rule 
the basel ii guidelines became operational in april  but are mandatory only for banks with consolidated total assets of billion or more or consolidated on balance sheet foreign exposures of billion or more 
the us implementation timetable consists of a parallel calculation period under the current regulatory capital regime basel i and basel ii  starting any time between april  and april  followed by a three year transition period  typically starting months after the beginning of parallel reporting 
the us banking regulators have reserved the right to change how basel ii is applied in the us following a review at the end of the second year of the transitional period  and to retain the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the us the basel ii requirements are the subject of political debate and potential change in light of recent events 
trustmark and tnb are not required to comply with basel ii at this time due to its asset size and lack of on balance sheet foreign exposure 
somerville  which is not a significant subsidiary as defined by the sec and thus is not discussed in detail in this section  was also in compliance with all applicable capital adequacy guidelines at december payment of dividends and other restrictions the principal source of trustmark s cash revenues is dividends from tnb 
there are various legal and regulatory provisions that limit the amount of dividends tnb can pay to trustmark without regulatory approval 
approval of the occ is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income from the preceding two years 
tnb will have available in approximately million plus its net income for that year to pay as dividends 
in addition  subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries 
further  subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property or furnishing of any services to the bank holding company 

table of contents fdic deposit insurance assessments the deposits of tnb are insured up to regulatory limits set by the deposit insurance fund dif  as administered by the fdic  and  accordingly  are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif 
the fdic uses a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating the camels component rating 
for risk category i institutions generally those institutions with less than billion in assets  including trustmark national bank  assessment rates are determined from a combination of financial ratios and camels component ratings 
the minimum annualized assessment rate for risk category i institutions during was basis points per of deposits with the maximum rate being basis points 
assessment rates for institutions in risk category i may vary within this range depending upon changes in camels component ratings and financial ratios 
in  tnb s expenses related to deposit insurance premiums totaled million  which reflects the impact of both increased assessment rates as well as a five basis point special assessment 
in addition  tnb also paid approximately thousand in financing corporation fico assessments related to outstanding fico bonds for which the fdic serves as collection agent 
the bonds issued by the fico are due to mature from through for the quarter ended december   the fico assessment was equal to basis points per of deposits 
somerville s total fdic expenses for totaled thousand 
on october   as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage was increased from  to  per depositor 
the eesa  as amended by the helping families save their homes act of  provides that the basic deposit insurance limit will return to  after december   except for iras and certain other retirement accounts  which will remain at  per depositor 
on october   the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which was designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system 
the tlgp consists of two components a temporary guarantee of certain newly issued unsecured debt the debt guarantee program and a temporary unlimited deposit insurance on funds in noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts not covered by the federal deposit insurance coverage limit of  the transaction account guarantee program 
under the debt guarantee program  the fdic guarantees  with certain limitations  newly issued senior unsecured debt with a term greater than days of eligible participating entities 
under the transaction account guarantee program  the fdic guarantees noninterest bearing transaction accounts  as well as negotiable order of withdrawal  or now  accounts with interest rates of basis points or less 
trustmark and its banking subsidiaries opted to participate in both programs  but incurred no additional assessment for the debt guarantee program since it currently has no qualifying debt outstanding 
participants in the transaction account guarantee program  including trustmark  paid an assessment of basis points for covered deposits exceeding  the debt guarantee program expired on october   although the fdic established a limited emergency guarantee facility that is available to entities that apply to and receive prior approval from the fdic 
the fdic extended the transaction account guarantee program which had originally been set to expire on december  to june  and increased the assessment rate to  or basis points  depending on the institution s risk category 
the assessment rate applicable to trustmark for participation in the transaction account guarantee program from december  to june  will be basis points  based on trustmark s inclusion in risk category i 
the fdic has stated its intention  as part of a proposed plan to restore the dif following significant decreases in its reserves  to increase deposit insurance assessments 
on january   the fdic increased its assessment rates and has since imposed further rate increases and changes to the current risk based assessment system 
on may   the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets less tier capital as of june  on september   the fdic increased annual assessment rates uniformly by basis points beginning in on november   the fdic adopted a final rule requiring a majority of institutions to prepay their quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and trustmark s prepaid assessment amount was approximately million and was collected by the fdic on december  recent regulatory developments in november  the federal reserve board adopted final rules that prohibit financial institutions  such as trustmark  from charging customers for paying overdrafts on atm and one time debt card transactions  unless the consumer consents to the overdraft service for those products 
this change will reduce the fees that trustmark is able to charge when customers have insufficient funds in an account 
trustmark estimates that this charge  which becomes effective on july   may reduce noninterest income by approximately million to million for the year ending december

risk factors trustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties  which are difficult to predict 
as a financial institution  trustmark has significant exposure to market risk  including interest rate risk  liquidity risk and credit risk 
this section includes a description of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that could materially affect trustmark s financial condition and results of operations  as well as the value of trustmark s financial instruments in general  and trustmark common stock  in particular 
additional risks and uncertainties that management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair trustmark s financial condition and results of operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below 
the occurrence of any one of  or of a combination of  these risk factors could have a material negative effect on trustmark s financial condition or results of operations 
trustmark s largest source of revenue net interest income is subject to interest rate risk 
trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking  since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change 
for the year ended december   trustmark s total interest income was million while net interest income was approximately million 
trustmark s simulation model using balances at december  estimated that in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  there would be a reduction in net interest income of 
net interest income is trustmark s largest revenue source  and it is important to understand how trustmark is subject to interest rate risk 

table of contents in general  for a given change in interest rates  the amount of the change in value positive or negative is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities 
the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields  funding costs and investment income differently 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates decline sharply  loans may pre pay  or pay down  faster than anticipated  thus reducing future cash flows and interest income 
conversely  if interest rates increase  depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives 
repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times 
for example  in a falling rate environment  if assets reprice faster than liabilities  there will be an initial decline in earnings 
moreover  if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time  they may not be by the same increment 
for instance  if the federal funds rate increased basis points  rates on demand deposits may rise by basis points  whereas rates on prime based loans will instantly rise basis points 
trustmark may face increased regulation of its industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase its costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities 
financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates 
this causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income  net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
therefore  management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts trustmark s funding strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on trustmark s balance sheet 
trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge mortgage servicing rights msr in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from rapidly changing interest rate environments 
in spite of trustmark s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies  significant risks are involved that  if realized  may prove such strategies to be ineffective  which could adversely affect results of operations 
risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform  the risk that these hedging strategies rely on management s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors  including prepayment risk  basis risk  market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve  and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect  the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model  and  the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results 
trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change 
trustmark makes use of both on and off balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk 
the national economic recession has increased the business risks for trustmark 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption during the last two years 
issues in the housing market over the past year  with anemic improvement in home prices  along with prolonged losses of jobs continuing to add uncertainty to the employment outlook  have negatively impacted the credit performance of loans and resulted in writedowns of asset values by financial institutions  including trustmark 
for example  in trustmark s florida market  which is the market in which trustmark has experienced the greatest impact from the economic recession  at december   approximately million in aggregate principal amount of loans  or approximately of total florida loans of approximately million  were classified as criticized  meaning that those loans exhibit potential credit weaknesses 
of those loans  approximately million in aggregate principal amount of loans were classified as impaired  meaning that they are collateral dependent  and that trustmark charges off the full difference between the loan value and the net realizable value of the underlying collateral 
for trustmark  the amount of nonaccrual loans rose by approximately from december  to approximately million at december  at december   trustmark s total nonperforming assets amounted to approximately million  an increase of approximately over total nonperforming assets at december  
table of contents trustmark does not assume that the difficult conditions in the economy and in the financial markets generally  and in particular in the florida market  will improve significantly in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on trustmark 
in particular  trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates  which  among other effects  could further affect trustmark s charge offs and provision for loan losses 
conditions in trustmark s markets in mississippi  tennessee or texas  which to date have been less severe than in trustmark s florida market  could worsen 
competition in the industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
the current market disruptions make valuation of assets even more difficult and subjective  and management s ability to measure the fair value of trustmark s assets could be adversely affected 
if management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value  trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made  trustmark s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such change and a rating agency might downgrade its credit rating or put trustmark on credit watch 
trustmark may face increased regulation of its industry as a result of the issuance of new regulations 
compliance with such regulation may increase its costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities 
trustmark is subject to lending risk  which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations 
there are inherent risks associated with trustmark s lending activities 
as discussed above  the current economic recession resulted in increases in trustmark s loan losses and impaired loans 
if current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue  trustmark may continue to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
moreover  if a prolonged recession occurs  management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in trustmark s market areas and that trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review trustmark s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge offs  based on judgments different from those of management 
as a result  trustmark may elect to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future  particularly if economic conditions continue to deteriorate 
trustmark is subject to liquidity risk  which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations 
liquidity refers to trustmark s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations  including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals  funding operating costs and other corporate purposes 
liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short term and long term wholesale borrowings  including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  brokered deposits  the federal reserve discount window  federal home loan bank fhlb advances and taf borrowings 
any significant restriction or disruption of trustmark s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on trustmark s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations  which could materially affect trustmark s financial condition 
in addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to trustmark  there is the risk that trustmark s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to trustmark 
trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short term ratings downgrade over various grading levels 
trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit  available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets 
to mitigate such risk  trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the frb and the fhlb that are secured by loans and investment securities 
management continuously monitors trustmark s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies 

table of contents declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investments 
we maintain an investment portfolio that includes  among other asset classes  obligations of states and municipalities  agency mortgage related securities and corporate securities 
as of december   we had approximately billion of securities available for sale and billion of securities held to maturity 
we may be required to record mark to market adjustments on our investment securities 
the market value of investments in our investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities  such as ratings downgrades  adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities 
in addition  government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities  such as the conservatorship of fnma and fhlmc 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
as of december   we had total gross unrealized losses in respect of our temporarily impaired securities of million 
we may be required to record impairment charges if our investments suffer a decline in value that is other than temporary 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to charge against earnings the credit related portion of the other than temporary impairment  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a write off  if any  occurs 
the effects of the federal government s efforts to wind down various programs implemented to support the financial markets cannot be predicted 
economic conditions  particularly over the course of the last year and a half  have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the financial services industry 
the federal government has intervened on an unprecedented scale 
many of these programs are in the process of being unwound  as the government seeks to affect an orderly withdrawal of this support 
the effects of this wind down on trustmark  or on the markets in which we compete  cannot be predicted 
legislators and regulators are considering a wide range of potential regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry  which  if enacted  could materially affect trustmark s results of operations  financial condition  liquidity or the market price of our common stock 
the federal government is considering various proposals for a comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory structure for the financial markets 
in addition  various forms of taxes on financial institutions to fund government resolution authority for failed large institutions  as well as taxes designed to  in effect  reimburse the federal government for the perceived costs incurred by the federal government to date in its actions to support the markets 
it is not possible to predict the form any such new regulations or taxes  if enacted  will take  or whether any such efforts will succeed in improving economic conditions nationally or in our markets  or whether the measures adopted will have consequences that prove to be adverse to the markets  either nationally or in which trustmark competes 
it is possible that these measures could adversely affect the creditworthiness of counterparties of trustmark  which could increase our risk profile 
trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry 
trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national and regional banks  as well as community banks within the various markets in which trustmark operates 
at this time  major international banks do not compete directly with trustmark in its markets  although they may do so in the future 
trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
some of trustmark s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many of trustmark s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than trustmark 
trustmark s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to continue to expand trustmark s market position through organic growth and acquisitions  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors  and industry and general economic trends

any such losses  which may be difficult to detect  could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the occurrence of such a loss could expose us to reputational risk  the loss of customer business  additional regulatory scrutiny or civil litigation and possible financial liability 
we may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are beyond our control for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages 
we are further exposed to the risk that our third party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as us 
these disruptions may interfere with service to our customers and result in a financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
in order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services  the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies

natural disasters  such as hurricanes  could have a significant negative impact on trustmark s business 
many of trustmark s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the gulf coast regions of texas  mississippi and florida  which regions are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes 
as reported in previous filings  hurricane katrina had a catastrophic effect on trustmark s mississippi market  and in late summer  hurricane gustav threatened to create a similar result in the houston metropolitan area  which is the location of trustmark s texas operations 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  could have a significant negative impact on the stability of trustmark s deposit base  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans  and could cause trustmark to incur material additional expenses 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of a natural disaster  especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable trustmark s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event  could have a material adverse effect on trustmark

table of contents tnb s relationship with the stanford financial group began as a result of trustmark s acquisition of a houston based bank in august  and consisted of correspondent banking and other traditional banking services in the ordinary course of business 
the lawsuit is in its preliminary stage and has been previously reported in the press 
trustmark believes that the lawsuit is entirely without merit and intends to defend vigorously against it 
trustmark and its subsidiaries are also parties to other lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
some of the lawsuits assert claims related to the lending  collection  servicing  investment  trust and other business activities  and some of the lawsuits allege substantial claims for damages 
the cases are being vigorously contested 
in the regular course of business  management evaluates estimated losses or costs related to litigation  and provision is made for anticipated losses whenever management believes that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
at the present time  management believes  based on the advice of legal counsel and management s evaluation  that the final resolution of pending legal proceedings will not have a material impact on trustmark s consolidated financial position or results of operations  however  management is unable to estimate a range of potential loss on these matters because of the nature of the legal environment in states where trustmark conducts business
