in addition  following our recent acquisition of wildblue  we are a leading provider of satellite broadband internet services in the united states 
viasat operates in three segments government systems  commercial networks and satellite services 
recent transactions on december   we consummated our acquisition of wildblue  a leading ka band satellite broadband internet service provider 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash and issued approximately million shares of viasat common stock to the wildblue investors 
viasat retained approximately million of wildblue s cash on hand 
to finance in part the cash payment made to the wildblue investors  in october we issued million in aggregate principal amount of notes and  in december  we borrowed million under our credit facility 
during fiscal year  we increased the amount of our revolving line of credit under the credit facility from million to million 
on march   we and certain wildblue investors completed the sale of an aggregate of  shares of viasat common stock in an underwritten public offering   of which were sold by us and  of which were sold by such wildblue investors 
our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
the shares sold by such wildblue investors in the offering constituted shares of our common stock issued to such wildblue investors in connection with our acquisition of wildblue 
we expect to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  which may include working capital  capital expenditures  financing costs related to the purchase  launch and operation of viasat or any future satellite  or other potential acquisitions 
on april   we used million of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility

satellite services our satellite services segment complements our commercial networks segment by providing wholesale and retail satellite based broadband internet services in the united states via our satellite and capacity agreements and managed network services for the satellite communication systems of our consumer  enterprise and mobile broadband customers 
the primary services offered by our satellite services segment comprise wholesale and retail broadband services  comprised of wildblue service  which provides two way satellite based broadband internet access to consumers and small businesses in the united states 
as of april   we provided wildblue service to approximately  subscribers 
in addition  following the launch of viasat  we expect to provide wholesale and retail broadband service via viasat in the united states at speeds and volumes that provide a broadband experience that is comparable to or better than terrestrial broadband alternatives such as cable modems and dsl connections 
we expect this service to become available in mid we plan to offer wholesale broadband services via viasat to national and regional distribution partners  including retail service providers and communications companies 
we plan to offer our retail service via viasat through wildblue  mobile broadband services  comprised of global network management services for customers who use our arclight based mobile satellite systems  and managed broadband services  comprised of a full service managed broadband service for everyday enterprise networking or backup protection for primary networks 
sources of revenues to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution  and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets 
our products are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
fixed price contracts  which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price  comprised approximately of our revenues for fiscal year and of our revenues for both fiscal years and the remainder of our revenue for such periods was derived from cost reimbursement contracts under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 

table of contents historically  a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customer contracts that include the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer s specific requirements and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development from our customer contracts were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incur independent research and development expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
independent research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development programs 
independent research and development expenses were approximately  and of revenues during fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our independent research and development expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
our satellite services segment revenues are primarily derived from our recently acquired wildblue business which provides wholesale and retail satellite based broadband internet services in the united states and our managed network services which complement the commercial networks segment by supporting the satellite communication systems of our enterprise and mobile broadband customers 
executive summary we develop  manufacture and provide services related to satellite ground systems and other related government and commercial digital communication and networking equipment 
our products are generally highly complex and have a concept to market timeline of several months to several years 
the development of products where customers expect state of the art results requires an exceptionally talented and dedicated engineering workforce 
since inception  we have been able to attract  develop and retain engineers who support our business and customer objectives  while experiencing low turnover relative to our industry 
the consistency and depth of our engineering workforce has enabled us to develop leading edge products and solutions for our customers 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of wildblue see note 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of wildblue from the date of acquisition in our satellite services segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from long term contracts requiring development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications 
sales related to these contracts are accounted for under authoritative guidance for the percentage of completion method of accounting the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts asc 
sales and earnings under these contracts are recorded either based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract or as products are shipped under the units of delivery method 

table of contents the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
for contract claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
during fiscal years  and  we recorded losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to loss contracts 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and future cost estimates or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
we believe we have established appropriate systems and processes to enable us to reasonably estimate future cost on our programs through regular quarterly evaluations of contract costs  scheduling and technical matters by business unit personnel and management 
historically  in the aggregate  we have not experienced significant deviations in actual costs from estimated program costs  and when deviations that result in significant adjustments arise  we would disclose the related impact in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
however  these estimates require significant management judgment and a significant change in future cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our results of operations 
a one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed price contracts as of april  would change our income before income taxes by approximately million 
we also have contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products or performance of services in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition asc 
under this standard  we recognize revenue when an arrangement exists  prices are fixed and determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and the goods or services have been delivered 
we also enter into certain leasing arrangements with customers and evaluate the contracts in accordance with fasb asc topic leases 
our accounting for equipment leases involves specific determinations under the authoritative guidance  which often involve complex provisions and significant judgments 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance  we classify the transactions as sales type or operating leases based on review for transfers of ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term  review of the lease terms to determine if it contains an option to purchase the leased property for a price which is sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property at the date of the option  review of the lease term to determine if it is equal to or greater than of the economic life of the equipment and review of the present value of the minimum lease payments to determine if they are equal to or greater than of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the lease 
additionally  we consider the cancelability of the contract and any related uncertainty of collections or risk in recoverability of the lease investment at lease inception 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease or when the equipment has been delivered and installed at the customer site  if installation is required 
revenues from equipment rentals under operating leases are recognized as earned over the lease term  which is generally on a straight line basis 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements asc  and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether sufficient objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues represent cash collected from customers in advance of revenue recognition and are recorded in accrued liabilities for obligations within the next twelve months 
deferred revenues extending beyond the twelve months are recorded within other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents stock based compensation under the authoritative guidance for share based payments sfas  share based payments asc  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the employees requisite service period 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date 
the black scholes model requires using judgment to estimate stock price volatility  the expected option life  the risk free interest rate  and the dividend yield  which are used to calculate fair value 
compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest  with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on the company s historical experience and future expectations 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to compensation cost may be required in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable based on historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  our bad debt allowances have been minimal  a contributing factor to this is that a significant portion of our sales has been to the us government 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of april   and our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of april  warranty reserves we provide limited warranties on our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products or they are included in long term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
amounts expected to be incurred within twelve months are classified as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
goodwill we account for our goodwill under authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets asc 
the guidance sfas asc for goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
reporting units within our government systems  commercial networks and satellite services segments have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value  if any  represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value such as market comparable transactions  etc 
we base the forecast of future cash flows on our best estimate of the future revenues and operating costs  which we derive primarily from existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular reporting unit to either pass or fail the first step in the guidance sfas asc related to the goodwill impairment model  which could significantly influence whether a goodwill impairment needs to be recorded 
we adjust the cash flow forecasts by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
in applying the first step  which is identification of any impairment of goodwill  no impairment of goodwill has resulted 

table of contents property  equipment and satellites equipment  computers and software  furniture and fixtures  and our viasat satellite under construction are recorded at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
costs are capitalized as incurred and for our satellite include construction  launch and insurance 
satellite construction costs  including launch services and insurance  are generally procured under long term contracts that provide for payments by us over the contract periods 
in addition  interest expense is capitalized on the carrying value of the satellite during the construction period 
satellite construction and launch services costs are capitalized to reflect progress toward completion  which typically coincides with contract milestone payment schedules 
insurance premiums related to the satellite launch and subsequent in orbit testing are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the satellite 
performance incentives payable in future periods are dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellite in service 
as a result of the acquisition of wildblue on december   we acquired the wildblue satellite which was placed into service in march and an exclusive prepaid lifetime capital lease of ka band capacity on telesat canada s anik f satellite which was placed into service in april 
the acquired assets also included the indoor and outdoor customer premise equipment cpe units leased to subscribers under wildblue s retail leasing program 
impairment of long lived assets property  equipment and satellites  and other assets in accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property  equipment and satellites and other assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets are less than the asset s carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
no material impairments were recorded by us for fiscal years  and income taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes asc  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our valuation allowance of million and million against deferred tax assets at april  and april   respectively  relate to state net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards available to reduce state income taxes 
the increase in the valuation allowance was due to the acquisition of certain deferred tax assets of wildblue 
the acquired deferred tax assets from wildblue were recorded net of the valuation allowance 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
asc 
under the guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the guidance addresses the derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of business there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in addition  changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision 
we believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
however  if these provided amounts prove to be more than what is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense would result

amortization of acquired intangible assets 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives ranging from eight months to ten years 
the increase in amortization was primarily due to the amortization of approximately million related to the new intangibles acquired as a result of the wildblue acquisition in december  offset partially by a decrease in amortization due to the fact that certain acquired technology intangibles in our commercial networks segment became fully amortized over the preceding twelve months 

table of contents the expected amortization expense of amortizable acquired intangible assets for the next five fiscal years is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year thereafter interest income 
the decrease in interest income of million year over year was primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments and lower average invested cash balances during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year interest expense 
the increase in interest expense of million year over year was primarily due to interest expense on the notes and the credit facility 
we capitalized million of interest expense associated with the construction of our viasat satellite and other assets during fiscal year compared to no amounts capitalized during fiscal year the amount of such capitalized interest will depend on the carrying value of the viasat satellite and the duration of the construction phase of the project 
we expect to incur significantly more interest expense as a result of the issuance on october  of the notes and will continue to capitalize additional interest related to our viasat satellite construction project  as appropriate 
provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate remained flat at in fiscal years and the provision for income taxes for fiscal year reflects the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit on december   and the recognition of approximately million of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain previously filed tax returns

the lower ir d expenses were principally due to a shift of some of our efforts from internal development projects to customer funded development 
amortization of intangible assets 
the intangible assets from prior acquisitions are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from eight months to ten years 
the amortization of intangible assets will decrease each year as the intangible assets with shorter lives become fully amortized 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to lower interest rates on our investments and lower average invested cash balances during year over year

segment operating profit dollar percentage fiscal years ended increase increase in millions  except percentages april  march  decrease decrease segment operating profit percentage of segment revenues our commercial networks segment operating profit decreased in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to higher selling  support and new business proposal costs of million 
we also experienced operating profit decreases due to the addition of certain consumer product programs for next generation broadband equipment yielding lower margins compared to prior year 
these operating profit decreases were slightly offset by better program performance in our antenna systems products group totaling approximately million and in our mobile satellite systems programs totaling approximately million

table of contents backlog as reflected in the table below  both funded and firm backlog increased during fiscal year  primarily due to some expected large contract awards that we began pursuing in fiscal year and for which negotiations were completed in fiscal year april  april  in millions firm backlog government systems segment commercial networks segment satellite services segment total funded backlog government systems segment commercial networks segment satellite services segment total contract options the firm backlog does not include contract options 
of the million in firm backlog  approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year  and the balance is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and thereafter 
we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
our total new awards were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
new contract awards in fiscal year were a record for us 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer 
orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related contract 
firm backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing  debt financing and equity financing 
during fiscal year  we generated million of net cash from financing activities  which included net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock  the issuance of the notes and additional borrowings under our credit facility 
the general cash needs of our government systems  commercial networks and satellite services segments can vary significantly and depend on the type and mix of contracts in backlog ie  product or service  development or production  and timing of payments  the quality of the customer ie  government or commercial  domestic or international  the duration of the contract and the timing of payment of capital expenditures eg milestones under our satellite construction and launch contracts 
in addition  primarily within our government systems and commercial networks segments  program performance significantly impacts the timing and amount of cash flows 
if a program is performing and meeting its contractual requirements  then the cash flow requirements are usually lower 
the cash needs of the government systems segment tend to be more a function of the type of contract rather than customer quality 
also  us government procurement regulations tend to restrict the timing of cash payments on the contract 
in the commercial networks and satellite services segments  our cash needs are driven primarily by the quality of the customer and the type of contract 
the quality of the customer can affect the specific contract cash flow and whether financing instruments are required by the customer 
in addition  the commercial networks and satellite services financing environments tend to provide for more flexible payment terms with customers  including advance payments 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily attributed to a year over year net decrease in cash used for net operating assets of million and higher earnings after the effect of non cash add backs of approximately million  which were mainly comprised of depreciation and deferred income taxes 
the net operating asset decrease was predominantly due to an increase in our collections in excess of revenues included in accrued liabilities  which increased million from the prior fiscal year end  prior to the effect of the wildblue acquisition 
collections in excess of revenues increased in fiscal year due to the timing of certain larger development projects milestones billings on programs in our government systems segment and commercial networks segment 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal year of million 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to million of net cash used for the acquisition of wildblue  as well as an increase of approximately million for capital expenditures for other equipment and new cpe units 
our payments for the construction of viasat were consistent with the prior year at approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to million for fiscal year the approximate million increase in cash inflows for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily related to the million in proceeds  net of issue discount  from issuance of the notes in october  million in proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility  and million in net proceeds from a public offering of common stock in march these cash inflows were offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of million and the repurchase of  shares of viasat common stock from intelsat for approximately million 
in addition  cash provided by financing activities for both periods included cash received from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases  offset by the repurchase of common stock related to net share settlement of certain employee tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards 
satellite related activities in january  we entered into several agreements with space systems loral  inc ss l  loral space communications  inc 
loral and telesat canada related to our anticipated high capacity satellite system 
under the satellite construction contract with ss l  we purchased viasat  a new high capacity ka band spot beam satellite designed by us and currently under construction by ss l for approximately million  subject to purchase price adjustments based on satellite performance 
the total cost of the satellite is million  but  as part of the satellite purchase arrangements  loral executed a separate contract with ss l whereby loral is purchasing the canadian beams on the viasat satellite for approximately million of the total satellite cost 
we have entered into a beam sharing agreement with loral  whereby loral has agreed to reimburse us for of the total costs associated with launch and launch insurance  which is estimated to be approximately million  and in orbit insurance and satellite operating costs post launch 
in november  we entered into a launch services agreement with arianespace to procure launch services for viasat at a cost estimated to be million  depending on the mass of the satellite at launch 
in march  we substituted ils international launch services  inc ils for arianespace as the primary provider of launch services for viasat and  accordingly  we entered into a contract for launch services with ils to procure launch services for viasat at an estimated cost of approximately million  subject to certain adjustments  resulting in a net savings of approximately million 
on may   we entered into an amended and restated launch services agreement with arianespace 
under the terms of the amended and restated launch services agreement  arianespace has agreed to perform certain launch services to maintain the launch capability for viasat  should the need arise  or for launch services of a future viasat satellite launch prior to december this amendment and restatement also provides for certain cost adjustments depending on fluctuations in foreign currencies  mass of the satellite launched and launch period timing 
the projected total cost of the viasat project  including the satellite  launch  insurance and related gateway infrastructure  through in service of the satellite is estimated to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest  and will depend on the timing of the gateway infrastructure roll out  among other things 
however  we anticipate capitalizing certain amounts of interest expense related to our outstanding borrowings in connection with our capital projects under construction  such as construction of viasat and other assets 
we continually evaluate alternative strategies that would limit our total required investment 
we believe we have adequate sources of funding for the project  which includes our cash on hand  the cash we expect to generate from operations over the next few years  and additional borrowing ability based on our financial position and debt leverage ratio 
we believe this provides us flexibility to execute this project in an appropriate manner and or obtain outside equity under terms that we consider reasonable

in connection with the private placement of the notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers in which we agreed to file a registration statement with the sec to permit the holders to exchange or resell the notes 
we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate an exchange offer within days after the issuance of the notes or  under certain circumstances  to prepare and file a shelf registration statement to cover the resale of the notes

at april   the effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 
we have capitalized certain amounts of interest expense on our credit facility in connection with the construction of viasat and other assets 
the credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and collateralized by substantially all of our respective assets 
at april   we had million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and million outstanding under standby letters of credit  leaving borrowing availability under the credit facility of million 
the credit facility contains financial covenants regarding a maximum leverage ratio  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
in addition  the credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to sell assets  make investments and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  grant liens  pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments 
on december   we amended the credit facility to clarify the calculation of ebitda following the completion of the wildblue acquisition 
on march   we further amended the credit facility to  among other things  increase the aggregate amount of letters of credit that may be issued from million to million  permit viasat to request an increase in the revolving loan commitment under the credit facility of up to million  increase the basket for permitted indebtedness for capital lease obligations from million to million  increase the maximum permitted leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio  decrease the minimum permitted interest coverage ratio  and increase certain baskets under the credit facility for permitted investments and capital expenditures 
on march   we increased the amount of our revolving line of credit under the credit facility from million to million 
to further enhance our liquidity position  we may obtain additional financing  which could consist of debt  convertible debt or equity financing from public and or private capital markets 
in march  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for the future sale of an unlimited amount of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants and rights 
the securities may be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us  by selling security holders  or through underwriters  dealers or agents at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
on march   we and certain wildblue investors completed the sale of an aggregate of  shares of viasat common stock in an underwritten public offering   of which were sold by us and  of which were sold by such wildblue investors 
our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
the shares sold by wildblue investors in the offering constituted shares of our common stock issued to such wildblue investors in connection with our acquisition of wildblue 
we expect to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  which may include working capital  capital expenditures  financing costs related to the purchase  launch and operation of viasat or any future satellite  or other potential acquisitions 
on april   we used million of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing and amount of cash required for the viasat satellite project pursuant to our contractual commitments  other future broadband satellite projects we may engage in  expansion of our research and development and marketing efforts  and the nature and timing of orders 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies which may require the use of cash 
we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities along with availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our obligations at april  for the fiscal years ending total thereafter in thousands operating leases and satellite capacity agreements the notes line of credit standby letters of credit purchase commitments including satellite related agreements total includes total interest payments on the notes of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million thereafter 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors  contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
we have also entered into agreements with suppliers for the construction  operation and launch of viasat in addition  we have contracted for an additional launch which can be used as a back up launch for viasat or for a future satellite 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
our consolidated balance sheets included million and million of other liabilities as of april  and april   respectively  which primarily consists of our long term warranty obligations  deferred lease credits  long term portion of deferred revenue and long term unrecognized tax position liabilities 
these remaining liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term and long term obligations  including the credit facility and the notes 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
as of april   we had million and million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and notes  respectively  and we held no short term investments 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit facility  cash equivalents  short term investments and short term obligations  as our notes bear interest at a fixed rate 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balance in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our cash and cash equivalents earn interest at variable rates 
given recent declines in interest rates  our interest income has been and may continue to be negatively impacted 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents  assuming balances remain constant over a year  changed by basis points  interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
because our investment policy restricts us to invest in conservative  interest bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio  we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material 
as of april   we had million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary interest rate under the credit facility is the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin that is based on the ratio of our debt to ebitda 
as of april   the effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 
assuming the outstanding balance remained constant over a year  a basis point increase in the interest rate would increase interest incurred prior to effects of capitalized interest and cash flow by approximately million 
foreign exchange risk we generally conduct our business in us dollars 
however  as our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies and we pay some of our vendors in euros  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency risk is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  from time to time  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of april   we had no foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding
