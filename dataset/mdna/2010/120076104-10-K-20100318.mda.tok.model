the build a bear workshop experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics  including children  teens  their parents and grandparents 
as of january   we operated stores in the united states  canada and puerto rico  stores in the united kingdom  one store in ireland and three stores in france  and had franchised stores operating in international locations under the build a bear workshop brand

com  which complements our interactive shopping experience and positively enhances our core brand value 
we also operate non traditional store locations in major league baseball ballparks  one location in a zoo and one location in a science center 
on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the bear factory limited  a stuffed animal retailer in the united kingdom  and amsbra limited  our former uk franchisee 
the results of the acquisitions operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
we are currently operating of the acquired stores  having permanently closed four locations during transition 
since  our european operations have grown to stores  including three in france 
we have improved sales performance and adopted internal best practices in the areas of merchandising  marketing  purchasing and store operations  across the acquired store base that resulted in improved sales and earnings from the acquisition 
we operate in three segments that share the same infrastructure  including management  systems  merchandising and marketing  and generate revenues as follows company owned retail stores located in the united states  canada  puerto rico  the united kingdom  ireland  and france  a webstore and seasonal  event based locations  international stores operated under franchise agreements  and license arrangements with third parties which manufacture and sell to other retailers merchandise carrying the build a bear workshop brand

net income declined in  and due primarily to the decrease in comparable store sales 
as we have added stores and grown our sales volume  the quantities of merchandise and supplies we purchase have increased which has created economies of scale for our vendors allowing us to obtain reduced costs for these items and increase our merchandise margin 
in  and  merchandise margin improvement was more than offset by fixed occupancy cost deleverage due primarily to the decrease in comparable store sales 
the store contribution of our average store  coupled with the fact that we have opened or acquired company owned stores since the beginning of fiscal had been the primary reasons for our net income increasing in fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents in and  our results reflect the challenging retail environment economic recession  declining mall traffic  and slowing consumer spending factors impacting many retailers and particularly our company given the discretionary nature of our products and our experience 
our total store contribution declined  primarily due to and decreases in comparable store sales in and  respectively 
this decrease in total store contribution was partially offset by approximately million in cost reductions in north america in our plan balances our long term business goals while recognizing the near term challenges of the retail environment 
while our full market potential in north america remains more than stores  we will open one new store in north america in  the same as in in the united kingdom and ireland  we believe our full market potential is approximately locations and we plan to open two new stores in  as compared to no new european stores in slowing new store growth allows us to refocus on our business and align all operations around our goals of new guest acquisition and guest retention aimed at improving our comparable stores sales performance  while also building our long term brand value 
our growth strategy is to develop and expand the reach of the build a bear workshop brand through product innovation and the full integration of product  marketing and operations to create a sense of urgency to drive traffic  increase conversion and improve sales 
additional toy products outside of our core plush animals  yet consistent with our interactive and hands on experience  will be added to our assortment 
we plan to continue to grow our virtual world engagement through buildabearville 
com  as well as improve our online and e commerce business 
we intend to refine our marketing programs balancing communication with new and existing guests and place emphasis on our product newness and collectability  a fundamental strength of our brand 
recognizing the severity of the economic recession  we implemented cost reduction initiatives that resulted in approximately million in pre tax savings in we ended fiscal with no borrowings under our bank loan agreement and with million in cash and cash equivalents after investing million in capital projects including one new store 
while our current sales trends reflect the continuing decline in consumer spending  we believe that our business strategies  superior store contribution model  strong cash flow and flexible capital structure will deliver long term sales and earnings growth 
following is a description and discussion of the major components of our statement of operations revenues net retail sales net retail sales are revenues from retail sales including our webstore and other non store locations  are net of discounts  exclude sales tax  include shipping and handling costs billed to customers  and are recognized at the time of sale 
revenues from gift cards are recognized at the time of redemption 
our guests use cash  checks  gift cards and third party credit cards to make purchases 
we classify stores as new or comparable stores and do not include our webstore or seasonal  event based locations in our store count or in our comparable store calculations 
stores enter the comparable store calculation in their thirteenth full month of operation and as such  european stores were not included for if a store relocation or remodel results in a significant change in square footage  the net retail sales for that location are excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the thirteenth full month of operation after the date of the change 
in the fiscal third quarter  we announced plans to close the friends b made concept 
as of january   all friends b made locations were closed 
all but one of these locations were inside or adjacent to a build a bear workshop store and shared common store management  employees and infrastructure 
other than our stand alone store in ontario  california  these locations were considered expansions of the existing build a bear workshop store and were not considered an addition to our total store count 
the net retail sales of these expanded build a bear workshop stores were excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the thirteenth full month of operation after the date of the expansion 
we have an automated loyalty program with a frequent shopper reward feature in north america  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar or partial dollar spent and after reaching points receive a discount on a future purchase 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption rates  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales at the time of purchase 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the discount 
as the reward certificates can be earned or redeemed at any of our store locations  we account for changes in the deferred revenue account at the total company level only 
therefore  when we refer to net retail sales by location  such as comparable stores or new stores  these amounts do not include any changes in the deferred revenue amount 
see critical accounting estimates for additional details on the accounting for the deferred revenue program

rents are negotiated on a fixed basis  but are reviewed annually in relation to an inflation index and therefore also have a variable rent component 
rents are charged quarterly and paid in advance 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures 
capital spending in fiscal totaled million 
capital spending in fiscal was primarily for the continued installation and upgrades of central office information technology systems  acquisition of intangible assets  repurposing existing friends b made locations to build a bear workshop stores  the opening of one new store and the relocation of one store 
on february   we announced a million share repurchase program of our outstanding common stock over the following twelve months 
the program was authorized by our board of directors 
on march   we announced an expansion of our share repurchase program to million for an additional twelve months 
on march   we announced a twelve month extension of our share repurchase program 
on march   we announced that our share repurchase program had been extended to march  we currently intend to purchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock in the open market including through b plans  through privately negotiated transactions or through an accelerated repurchase transaction 
the primary source of funding for the program is expected to be cash on hand 
the timing and amount of share repurchases  if any  will depend on price  market conditions  applicable regulatory requirements  and other factors 
the program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
shares repurchased under the program will be subsequently retired 
as of march   approximately  shares at an average price of per share have been repurchased under this program for an aggregate amount of million 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash flow requirements for the near future 
our credit agreement expires on december  off balance sheet arrangements we hold a minority interest in ridemakerz  which is accounted for under the equity method 
we purchased a call option from a group of other ridemakerz investors for  for million ridemakerz common units at an exercise price of per unit 
the call option was immediately exercisable and expires april  simultaneously  we granted a put option to the same group of investors for million common units at an exercise price of per unit 
the put option was exercisable on april  and expires on april  as of january   the book value of our investment in ridemakerz had been reduced to zero 
we still retained an ownership interest of approximately 
under the current agreements  we could own up to approximately of fully diluted equity in ridemakerz

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include future minimum obligations under operating leases and purchase obligations 
our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise inventory and obligations associated with building out our stores 
the future minimum payments for these obligations as of january  for periods subsequent to this date are as follows payments due by fiscal period as of january  total beyond in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our total liability for uncertain tax positions under the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc section was million as of january  during the next fiscal year  it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced by million either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or expiration of statute of limitations 
at this time  we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next year 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following critical accounting estimates inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on an average cost basis 
historically  we have not conducted sales whereby we offer products below cost 
throughout the year we record an estimated cost of shortage based on past experience 
the amount accrued for shortage each period is based on detailed historical averages 
the accrual rate remained unchanged for fiscal  and periodic physical inventories are taken and any difference between the actual physical count of merchandise and the recorded amount in our records are adjusted and recorded as shortage 
historically  including fiscal years  and  the timing of the physical inventory has been in the fourth quarter so that no material amount of shortage was required to be estimated on activity between the date of the physical count and year end 
however  future physical counts of merchandise may not be at times at or near the end of a fiscal quarter or fiscal year end  and our estimate of shortage for the intervening period may be material based on the amount of time between the date of the physical inventory and the date of the fiscal quarter or year end 
long lived assets in accordance with asc section we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset  or asset group  to expected future net cash flows generated by the asset  or asset group 
if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount is compared to its fair value and an impairment 
table of contents charge is recognized to the extent of the difference 
for purposes of evaluating store assets for impairment  we have determined that each store location is an asset group 
as of january   store assets represented approximately million  or approximately of total property  plant and equipment  net 
factors that we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant changes in our business strategies and or negative industry or economic trends 
we assess events and changes in circumstances or strategy that could potentially indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable as they occur 
due to the seasonality of operations  we assess store performance annually  using the full year s results 
we consider a historical and or projected negative cash flow trend for a store location to be an indicator that the carrying value of that asset group may not be recoverable 
as a result of our review  we determined that several stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of certain store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the financial performance of the asset group  future growth rate and discount rate 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value assumptions on store asset impairment  we applied a hypothetical decrease of in the comparable stores sales trend and in margin  which we believe is appropriate 
based on the analysis performed as of january   the changes in our assumptions would have resulted in additional impairment charges of million 
as a result of our review  we determined that several stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of certain store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group  and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
no store assets were impaired in fiscal in the event that we decide to close any or all of these stores in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment  lease termination charges  severance charges and other charges 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different than historical results 
as we continue to face a challenging retail environment and general uncertainty in the global economy  the assumptions used in future calculations of fair value may change significantly which could result in further impairment charges in future periods 
in the fiscal third quarter  we announced plans to close our friends b made concept 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million  related to the closures 
in  we incurred additional pre tax charges of approximately million  primarily attributable to lease termination charges  inventory write offs and construction costs incurred to reformat locations for return to the landlord 
corporate assets  including computer hardware and software and the company owned distribution center approximately million as of january   and certain intangible assets  such as trademarks and intellectual property  net  approximately million as of january   have a broad applicability and generally considered to be recoverable  unless abandoned 
other long lived assets  including deferred franchise and lease costs  key money and long term rent deposits  approximately million as of january   are monitored in relation to the relevant franchisee or store location 
in  we determined that certain key money and long term lease deposits were no longer fully recoverable 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
none of these other long lived assets were impaired in fiscal or goodwill and other intangibles we record goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
all of our recorded goodwill  which is associated with our uk acquisition  is recorded in the european reporting unit 
at january  and january   our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
the increase is due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
goodwill is subject to periodic evaluation for impairment when circumstances warrant  or at least once per year 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment is tested in accordance with asc section  by comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
as there are not quoted prices for our reporting unit  fair value is estimated based upon a present value technique using estimated discounted future cash flows  forecasted over the reasonably assured lease terms for retail stores  with growth rates forecasted for the reporting unit and using a credit adjusted discount rate 
we use current results  trends  future prospects  and other economic factors as the basis for expected future cash flows 
assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we make every effort to forecast these future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed 
however  changes in the assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of goodwill  and could result in additional 
table of contents impairment charges in future periods 
factors that have the potential to create variances between forecasted cash flows and actual results include but are not limited to i fluctuations in sales volumes  ii long term growth in the number of stores  and iii distribution costs  including fuel  and other product costs 
refer to forward looking statements included in the beginning of this form k for further information regarding the impact of estimates of future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the financial performance of the reporting unit  future growth rate  and discount rate 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease in cash flows  and made changes to our projected growth rate and discount rate which we believe are considered appropriate 
based on the goodwill analysis performed as of january   the outlined changes in our assumptions would not affect the results of the impairment test  as the reporting unit still had an excess of fair value over the carrying value 
however  as we continue to face a challenging retail environment and general uncertainty in the global economy  the assumptions used in future calculations of fair value may change significantly which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
revenue recognition revenues from retail sales  net of discounts and excluding sales tax  are recognized at the time of sale 
guest returns have not been significant 
revenues from gift certificates are recognized at the time of redemption 
unredeemed gift cards are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have an automated frequent shopper program in north america  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar or partial dollar spent and after reaching points receive a discount on a future purchase 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption rates  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales at the time of purchase 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the discount 
we use actual redemption rates and historical results to estimate how much revenue to defer 
we review these redemption rates and assess the adequacy of the deferred revenue account at the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the estimates involved in these assessments  adjustments to the deferral rate are generally made no more often than bi annually in order to allow time for more definite trends to emerge 
based on the most recent assessment at the end of fiscal  no adjustment was made to the deferral rate 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  specifically  expected redemption rates 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the recognition of deferred revenue  we applied a hypothetical decrease of bps in the redemption rate which we believe is appropriate 
based on the analysis performed as of january   the change in our assumptions would have resulted in a million reduction of net retail sales 
based on the assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue liability was adjusted downward by million  effective at the beginning of fiscal  with a corresponding increase to net retail sales  and a million increase in net income 
additionally  the amount of revenue being deferred for future periods was decreased by bps to give effect to the change in redemption experience and the increased visibility of the redemptions with the automated system 
in  we reduced the estimated liability by million 
recent accounting pronouncements there are no recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements that are expected to significantly impact our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our results of operations and our cash flows can be impacted by changes in interest rates 
outstanding balances under our credit facility bear interest at libor plus 
we had no borrowings outstanding during fiscal accordingly  a basis point change in interest rates would result in no material change to our annual interest expense 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we conduct operations in various countries  which expose us to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries and franchisees may be materially impacted by exposure to fluctuating exchange rates 
reported sales  costs and expenses at our foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
while exchange rate fluctuations can have a material impact on reported revenues  costs and expenses  and earnings  this impact is principally the result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows 

table of contents although we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the us  these obligations are settled primarily in us dollars and  therefore  we believe we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks for our purchase obligations 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes
