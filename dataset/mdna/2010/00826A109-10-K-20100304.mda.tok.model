item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel drugs to improve the treatment of serious and often life threatening conditions 
our product candidate  hematide  is designed to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
anemia is a serious condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells and hemoglobin 
it is common in patients with chronic renal failure  cancer  heart failure  inflammatory diseases and other critical illnesses  as well as in the elderly 
if left untreated  anemia may lead to chronic fatigue or increase the risk of other diseases or death 
currently recombinant epo  or repo  is used to manage the anemia of dialysis  pre dialysis and cancer patients 
according to ims health incorporated  repo generated billion in us revenues for  of which we estimate that over one half is attributable to use of repo in patients with chronic renal failure  and the remainder is attributable to other indications  primarily cancer patients 
hematide is a synthetic peptide based erythropoiesis stimulating agent  or esa  designed to stimulate production of red blood cells 
hematide is designed to be longer acting than currently marketed esas in the us and therefore has the potential to offer both better care for patients and reduced cost and complexity for healthcare providers 
we recently completed treatment and follow up of patients with anemia associated with chronic renal failure in the phase clinical program for hematide and expect to report top line results in the second quarter of our phase clinical program includes four open label  randomized controlled clinical trials 
of these trials  two trials  called pearl and pearl  were conducted in pre dialysis patients and designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hematide compared to darbepoetin alfa to correct anemia and maintain hemoglobin in a corrected range over time 
the other two trials  called emerald and emerald  were conducted in dialysis patients and designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hematide and its ability to maintain hemoglobin levels in a corrected range compared to epoetin alpha or epoetin beta when switched to hematide 
analysis of efficacy and safety for all of the phase studies will be based on assessments of non inferiority to the comparator drugs 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline 
in addition  the assessment of safety will include a composite cardiovascular endpoint from a pooled safety database 
to date  no esa other than hematide has been required to achieve this composite safety endpoint for initial regulatory approval 
in march  we completed a private placement raising million of net proceeds through the issuance of common stock and warrants exercisable for common stock 
under the terms of one of two purchase agreements  we sold  newly issued shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
in the other purchase agreement  we sold  newly issued units at a purchase price of per unit  with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase of a share of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable at per share and expire in march in september  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement  sometimes referred to as an equity line of credit arrangement  with azimuth opportunity ltd 
or azimuth that provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the purchase agreement  azimuth is committed to purchase up to million worth of shares of our common stock over the month term of the purchase agreement  provided  however  in no event may we sell under the purchase agreement more than such number of shares of common stock which is equal to one share less than of our outstanding shares or  of common stock on the effective date of the purchase agreement  and provided  further  that in no event shall azimuth be obligated to purchase under the purchase agreement any shares of our common stock which  when aggregated with all other shares of our common stock then owned beneficially by azimuth  would result in the beneficial ownership by azimuth of more than of the then issued and outstanding shares of our common stock 
the per 
table of contents share purchase price for these shares equals the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during the azimuth draw down period on which shares are purchased  less a discount ranging from to  based on a minimum price of as specified in the agreement 
upon each sale of our common stock to azimuth  we have agreed to pay reedland capital partners a placement fee equal to of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by azimuth 
the term of the purchase agreement ends october  there have been no purchases by azimuth under this agreement to date 
in november  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  at a per share price of  which includes the full exercise of the underwriter s overallotment option of  shares 
the net proceeds to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses are approximately million 
to date  we have not generated any product revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  reimbursement for development expenses and active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  production  license fees and milestone payments from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financings  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
since inception  we have incurred net losses and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years in order to complete the development and commercialization of hematide 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that the existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least months 
however  we expect that we will need to raise additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of hematide 
our current view of the worldwide capital markets is that they are extremely volatile with limited accessibility  and many biotechnology companies have been limited or unsuccessful in obtaining funding in this environment 
we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital  in the form of equity or otherwise  depending upon market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time 
continuation of this market may significantly limit our ability to raise funds such that there can be no assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations and maintain current development timelines  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  we have had to reduce our research capabilities and efforts  including the elimination of certain research programs  and even some activities related to the support of hematide 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we could be required to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
further  any strategic or licensing arrangements  if available  may require us to relinquish product rights that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of i expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites  which conduct a substantial portion of our pre clinical studies and all of our clinical trials  ii payments to contract manufacturing organizations  which produce our api  iii payments to consultants  iv license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property  v employee related expenses  which include salaries and related costs  and vi facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment  depreciation of leasehold improvements and 
table of contents equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
the table below sets out our research and development expenses excluding stock based compensation expenses by project since as a percentage of total research and development expenses for the applicable period 
we commence tracking the costs for a project when we are working with another company or when the related prototype peptide demonstrates significant biological activity  typically in a cell free assay  and merits substantial increase in the level of effort 
hematide other research programs total under the worldwide agreement with takeda pharmaceutical company limited or takeda  we and takeda will co develop and co commercialize hematide in the us beginning january   takeda was responsible for the first million of third party expenses related to development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of hematide  which was fully utilized by both parties through the first quarter of thereafter  takeda has borne of the third party us development expenses while we have been responsible for of the expenses 
we retain responsibility for of our internal development expenses 
in addition  third party expenses related to the commercialization of hematide in the us are equally shared by both parties and beginning in mid  certain employee expenses related to commercialization will also be equally shared 
takeda will have primary responsibility and bear all costs for hematide clinical development in support of regulatory approval for all territories outside the us the process of conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain food and drug administration  or fda  approval is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate s early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing hematide  in the future we may develop additional product candidates internally and in license product candidates  which will increase our research and development expenses in later periods 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative or g a expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business and commercial development  information technology  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent filing  prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  auditing and tax services 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance  revenue recognition in financial statements 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
application of this guidance requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
effective january  we adopted the provisions of the authoritative guidance for accounting for collaborative arrangements  which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangements and third parties 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in february and june  we entered into two separate collaboration agreements or the arrangement with takeda  which have been combined for accounting purposes due to their proximity of negotiation 
we evaluated the multiple elements under the combined single arrangement in accordance with the provisions of the guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we determined the deliverables do not have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and we were unable to obtain verifiable objective evidence to determine the fair value of the undelivered elements 
accordingly  we concluded that there was a single unit of accounting 
effective january   we entered into an amendment to the arrangement with takeda 
the amendment provides us the ability to opt out of our obligation to participate on the joint steering committee and any related subcommittees at any time beginning january  without any other modifications 
as a result  the obligation to participate in the joint steering committee and any related subcommittee is no longer indefinite 
accordingly  we determined that we can separate the performance obligations that occur over the development period from the performance obligations that will occur during the commercialization period 
we do not expect the development period obligations to extend past january  as a result of the change in performance period from indefinite to approximately years ie  the inception of the arrangement to january   beginning on january   we recognize revenue during the development period using the contingency adjusted performance model or capm 
under capm  revenue is eligible for recognition in the period the payment is earned under the arrangement including amounts that are either received or due from 
table of contents takeda 
revenue initially recognized is based on the percentage of time elapsed from inception of the arrangement in june to the period in which the payment is earned in relation to the total projected development period  which is currently estimated to end on january  the remaining portion of the payment is then recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated duration of the development period of the arrangement 
payments during the development period include amounts due for upfront license fees  milestone payments earned  purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredient or api and reimbursement of development and commercial expenses 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment totaling million for the change of estimate which was recognized as additional revenue  as a result of now being able to estimate the period of performance 
in the event our estimate of the development period were to extend past january   then the remaining deferred collaboration revenue would be recognized over a longer period 
through the period of the joint steering committee obligation  we expect collaboration revenue to be directly affected by milestone payments and expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda under the arrangement in future periods 
included in the reimbursable expense is the cost of api that we manufacture and supply to takeda during the development period  which we will also supply during the commercialization period 
a change in the estimated term of the development period could materially affect the amount of collaboration revenue recognized in future periods 
prior to january  we were unable to determine the period of our performance obligations under the arrangement as our required participation on the joint steering committee extended for as long as products subject to the collaboration with takeda were being sold by either of the parties 
accordingly  the contractual term of our joint steering committee obligations was considered indefinite 
as a result  revenue for the single unit of accounting was recorded on a proportional performance basis as long as the overall arrangement was determined to be profitable during the years ended december  and we accounted for the arrangement using a zero profit proportional performance model ie  revenue was recognized equal to direct costs incurred  but not in excess of cash received or receivable assuming that the overall arrangement was expected to be profitable 
we used an input based measure  specifically direct costs  to determine proportional performance because we believed that the inputs were representative of the value being conveyed to takeda through the research and development activities and delivery of the api 
we believed that using direct costs as the unit of measure of proportional performance also most closely reflected the level of effort related to our performance under the arrangement 
direct costs were those costs that directly resulted in the culmination of an earnings process for which takeda received a direct benefit 
the nature of these costs were third party and internal costs associated with conducting clinical trial activities for dialysis and pre dialysis indications  costs associated with the manufacturing of api and api stability testing  allocated payroll related costs for representatives participating on the joint steering committee and sales and marketing costs during the co commercialization period 
direct costs specifically excluded costs of a general and administrative nature  upfront payments to manufacturers unrelated to specific product manufactured such as reservation of capacity  cost for api not yet delivered to takeda  travel and expense related costs  sales and marketing costs during the development period  any research and development costs not associated with hematide  interest  depreciation and amortization expense 
revenue was recognized equal to direct costs incurred  but not in excess of cash received or receivable 
amounts resulting from payments received in advance of revenue recognized were recorded as deferred revenue until the earlier of i when we could meet the criteria for separate recognition of each element under the guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or ii after we had fulfilled all of its contractual obligations under the arrangement 
we were required to assess the profitability of the overall arrangement on a periodic basis throughout the life of the arrangement when events or circumstances indicated a potential change in facts 
profitability was defined as a net cash inflow resulting from the arrangement over its life 
such assessment was based on estimates to determine the most likely outcome based on available facts and 
table of contents circumstances at each assessment date 
the estimates included the consideration of factors such as the progress and timing of clinical trials  competitive esas in the market  drug related serious adverse events and other safety issues in the clinical trials  pricing reimbursement in relevant markets and historical costs incurred compared to original estimates 
when the periodic assessment or other events or circumstances indicated a loss would result from performance under the arrangement  costs would continue to be recognized as they were incurred 
however  revenue would be deferred until either i the arrangement became profitable  at which point revenue would continue to be recognized  or ii the end of the arrangement 
license and royalty revenue royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms  when third party results are reported and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalties received under agreements that were acquired by us in the spin out from glaxosmithkline or glaxo are recorded net of the that we are required to remit to glaxo 
clinical trial expense and accruals we record expense for estimated clinical study external costs  which are a significant component of research and development or r d expenses 
these clinical trial costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
clinical trials are administered by third party contract research organizations or cros 
cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for the trials  including document preparation  site identification pre study visits  training as well as on going program management 
for the phase studies  which represent the vast majority of the clinical trial expense  the expense recorded is based on reporting received from cros and internal analyses 
we accrue costs for work performed by cros based on the achievement of contracted activities during the period 
expense for investigator fees  which include patient costs  is based on internal estimates of activities using patient enrollment and contractual or estimated rates 
for the phase studies  the expense is activities based such as patient monitoring as reported by the cros and achievement of milestones 
other costs such as testing and drug materials are expensed as incurred 
for all studies  cro reporting is reviewed by us for appropriateness 
there is a significant degree of estimation involved in quantifying the clinical trial expenses 
the complexity and magnitude of the activities and expenses can be significant and subject to frequent change during the studies  especially for our phase trials 
the activities in our trials are performed globally  in many sites and countries  involving numerous cros and third parties 
if we do not receive complete and accurate information from the cro or third parties on a timely basis or correctly estimate activity levels  we may have to record adjustments  including potentially significant additional r d expenses  in subsequent periods 
during the quarter ended june   we identified an overstatement of clinical trial expense and collaboration revenue of million in the year ended december  as a result  clinical trial expense and collaboration revenue  which included reimbursement for these costs  included an out of period reduction of million and million  respectively  in the year ended december  stock based compensation we currently use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited and the expected life of the stock based payment awards 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock or restricted stock units  or rsus  market quotes are not available for long term  non transferable stock options because these instruments are not 
table of contents traded 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
we base our estimated expected option term and volatility on the realized volatilities of our peer companies 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under the authoritative guidance for share based payments 
there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the authoritative guidance for share based payments requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period  or the vesting period  in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the allocation of employee stock based compensation costs to each operating expense line are estimated based on specific employee headcount information at each grant date and estimated stock option forfeiture rates and revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual employee headcount information or forfeitures differ materially from those estimates 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated forward looking forfeiture rate 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards and historical experience 
these estimates are revised in subsequent periods based upon changes in facts or circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different than what was recorded in the current period 
for awards with a longer vesting period  the actual forfeiture rate and related expense may not be known for a longer period of time  which can result in more significant accounting adjustments once the awards are either vested or forfeited 
as a result  the amount of employee stock based compensation costs we recognize in each operating expense category in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
valuation of investments investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at their fair market value based upon quoted market prices for these or similar instruments at the balance sheet date 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
the amortized cost of these securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization as well as realized gains and losses are included in interest income 
we assess our investments for potential other than temporary impairment based on factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below our cost basis and the current financial condition of the investee 
we do not intend to sell an impaired security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if we conclude that an other than temporary impairment exists  we recognize an impairment charge to reduce the investment to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest to other income expense  net 
our investments  other than auction rate securities  or ars  are classified within level or level of the fair value measurement guidance on a three tier hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets  broker quotations or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
our investments in ars are classified within 
table of contents level of the fair value hierarchy because of the lack of observable inputs 
as a result  we determined the value of these ars at december  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis considers  among other things  the amount and timing of coupon payments  contractual terms  underlying collateralization  credit risk and an illiquidity discount factor 
the analysis considers that issuers have continued to meet interest payment obligations and are expected to continue to do so at levels consistent with issuer s credit risk 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
effective january   we adopted the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  that prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance resulted in no adjustment to our accumulated deficit as of january  we had million  million and million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december   and  respectively 
as of december  and  our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million and million  respectively  which was reflected as long term income tax liabilities on our balance sheet 
our policy is to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense  respectively  as necessary 
for the year ended december  and  we recognized  and  of interest expense  respectively  related to the million and million liability for uncertain income tax positions as of december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   no interest expense related to uncertain income tax positions was required or recognized 
for the years ended december  and  there were no penalties related to uncertain income tax positions 
for the year ended december    of penalties related to uncertain income tax positions were required and recognized 
we do not anticipate that any of the unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly over the next twelve months 
results of operations revenue revenue and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change collaboration revenue license and royalty revenue total revenues we recognized million and million of collaboration revenue under capm for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the collaboration revenue for the year ended december  included a million cumulative adjustment resulting from an amendment to the collaboration agreements with takeda  as discussed in the notes to our audited financial statements and an out of period reduction of million 
collaboration revenue under capm includes our expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda  net of takeda s own eligible expenses 
we recognized 
table of contents million of collaboration revenue under the zero profit proportional performance model for the year ended december  the increase in collaboration revenue in and was due to the growth in third party development expenses reimbursed by takeda related to our phase clinical trials  which commenced in late and achieved full enrollment in late as well as the continued amortization of revenue under capm from expense reimbursements and milestones received from takeda in prior periods 
we expect collaboration revenue to be directly affected by milestone payments and expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda under the arrangement in future periods 
based on our current estimate of the end of the development period  we expect the balance of deferred collaboration revenue as of december   to be fully recognized in fiscal in the event our estimate of the development period were to extend past january   then the remaining deferred collaboration revenue would be recognized over a longer period 
we recognized   and  of license and royalty revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the license and royalty revenue in was due to payments received under a license agreement that we acquired in the spin out from glaxo  net of the that we are required to remit to glaxo 
research and development expenses r d expenses and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change research development expenses the increase in r d expenses in and was primarily due to an increase of million and million  respectively  in clinical trial costs resulting from our phase clinical trials  which commenced in late  achieved full enrollment in late and continued through the end of further  the increase in r d expense in of million related to personnel costs resulting from increased headcount and stock based compensation expenses 
we expect r d expenses to substantially decrease in due to the completion of the treatment and follow up of our phase clinical trials at the start of and would be partially offset by any additional research and clinical trials conducted to obtain additional data for hematide 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change general administrative expenses the increase in g a expenses in as compared to was primarily due to higher legal fees 
the increase in g a expenses in was primarily due to an increase of million in legal and consulting fees and an increase of approximately million in personnel costs resulting from higher headcount and stock based compensation expenses 
we expect to incur increasing general and administrative expenses in future periods to support our preparation for the new drug application or nda for hematide and expansion of commercial capabilities

provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change provision benefit for income taxes calculation not meaningful we are subject to federal and california state income tax 
for the year ended december   we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million 
the tax benefit was for federal tax purposes  primarily the result of the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of enacted in november  which allowed us to carryback our net operating loss to and recover million in alternative minimum taxes previously paid for the year ended december  we also recorded a  federal benefit related to refundable research and development credits available to us pursuant to a provision within the housing assistance tax act of  which was signed into law in july for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes of  consisting of  of federal tax benefit and  of net california state income tax expense 
the  of federal tax benefit was primarily due to refundable research and development credits 
table of contents available pursuant to a provision within the housing assistance tax act of  which was signed into law in july the california state income tax expense of  was primarily related to an out of period reduction to our california research and development credits that was partially offset by additional california research and development credits that were identified 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million consisting of million of current income taxes  net of a million of deferred tax benefit 
the current income taxes of million resulted primarily from the inclusion in taxable income of million of the upfront license fees received from takeda during that  for tax purposes  were deferred in and recognized in and resulted in us federal and state taxable income for the year ended december  the upfront license fees from takeda were recorded as deferred revenue for financial reporting purposes and are being recognized as revenue over a period of approximately years  as more fully described in the critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates section in this annual report on form k 
the million net deferred tax benefit  and the related net deferred tax asset as of december  in the same amount  were recorded to reflect our ability to carry back tax losses generated in and as a result of certain reversing tax deductible temporary differences from december  as of december  and  we have a net deferred tax asset balance of million each in consideration of the uncertainty in income taxes liability recorded for the same amount 
we considered the following positive and negative factors in determining that it was more likely than not that the million each  of net deferred tax asset as of december   and would be realized net deductible temporary differences that were expected to reverse in and there were no relevant tax strategies available that we would consider feasible 
uncertainties  such as regulatory approval of hematide and binding arbitration and litigation with certain subsidiaries of johnson johnson  that if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect our future operations 
we have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital long term investments year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above 
table of contents since our inception  we have financed our operations through sale of capital stock  license fees  milestone payments and reimbursement for development and commercial expenses and manufacturing costs from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financing  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
from inception through december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of equity securities and million of upfront license fees  a million milestone payment and million for the reimbursement of development and commercial expenses and purchase of api from our collaboration agreements with takeda 
takeda was responsible for the first million of third party expenses related to the development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of hematide  which was fully utilized by both parties through the first quarter of thereafter  takeda has borne of the third party us development expenses  while we have been responsible for of the expenses 
we retain responsibility for of our internal development expenses 
in addition  third party expenses related to the commercialization of hematide in the us are equally shared by both parties and beginning in mid  certain employee expenses related to commercialization will also be equally shared 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and reflects net losses for the periods generated primarily by the development of hematide 
the increases in net losses reflects the trend of increasing expenses due to the timing of our phase trials  which commenced in late  achieved full enrollment in late and continued through the net losses in all years were reduced in part by non cash activities including stock based compensation  realized gain and loss on investments and depreciation and amortization 
the years ended december  and also reflect the benefit of increasing liabilities due to of the lag in payments relative to expense of our phase clinical trials for hematide and an other than temporary impairment charge related to our investments in ars 
net cash used in operations in all three years reflects the benefit of reimbursement received from takeda for development and commercial expense and purchase of api by takeda  which totaled million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  the year ended december  includes a million milestone payment received by takeda 
we are eligible to receive additional clinical development and regulatory milestones from takeda of approximately million relating to the renal program  including milestone payments upon completion of database lock of the phase clinical trials of million for dialysis and pre dialysis  million milestone payments upon fda acceptance of the submission of the nda and million of milestone payments upon approval by the fda in dialysis and pre dialysis indications 
further  we may receive from takeda up to an aggregate of million upon the achievement of certain worldwide annual net sales milestones 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was a result of the net purchase of investments using the proceeds from financings during the year  whereas cash used in investing activities for the year ended was the result of investment of funds held in cash and cash equivalents at the end of net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to maturities and sales of investments used in funding operations 
all three years reflect the usage of cash in the purchase of capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects the net proceeds from two financings during the year  specifically million from the private placement in march and million of net proceeds from a public offering in november the private placement also included warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at that are exercisable and expire in march each of the three years ended december   and include proceeds from issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to the financing activities noted above  in september we obtained an equity line of credit arrangement  with azimuth that provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions 
table of contents set forth in the purchase agreement  azimuth is committed to purchase up to million worth of shares of our common stock over the month term of the purchase agreement 
the term of the purchase agreement ends october  there have been no purchases by azimuth under this agreement to date 
as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government  certificate of deposit  money market funds and ars 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
included in our investments as of december  were ars with a fair value totaling million that were comprised of municipal issuances that are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and a closed end preferred issuance 
the ars held by us are rated a through aaa by a major credit rating agency 
ars are structured to provide liquidity by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  usually every days but have stated or contractual maturities that are significantly greater than one year 
the overall ars market deteriorated in early  and the ars held by us have failed in all but a single auction since mid march we determined the fair value of our ars at december  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis considers  among other things  the amount and timing of coupon payments  contractual terms  underlying collateralization and credit risk 
in addition  we included in our analysis an illiquidity factor to estimate the discount necessary to sell a security for which there is no active market 
the analysis considers that issuers have continued to meet interest payment obligations and are expected to continue to do so at levels consistent with issuer s credit risk 
our analysis resulted in a net decrease in fair value of ars totaling million as of december  the decrease in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary and was recorded as an impairment charge to other income expense  net 
we have the intent to sell the ars and  more likely than not  we would be required to sell the ars before anticipated recovery 
our analysis is based on dynamic market conditions and further deterioration in the ars markets or changes in our assumptions could lead to significant reductions in determined value thus resulting in impairments in future periods 
in november  ubs ag issued us ars rights in connection with the million of par value of ars we own as of december  the ars rights are not transferable and give us the option to require ubs to repurchase  at par  our ars beginning on june   and prior to such date  ubs has the option to buy  at par  the ars 
we determined the value of the ars rights was million as of december  using a discounted cash flow analysis based on  among other things  the timing and likelihood of the recovery of the par value of the ars from ubs 
we recorded the fair value of the ars rights as an other current asset with a corresponding credit to other income expense  net  partially offsetting the unrecognized losses incurred to date on the related ars 
we anticipate that future changes in the fair value of the ars rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of related ars with no material net impact to net loss 
in connection with ars rights  ubs made available loans to eligible borrowers 
in december  we obtained a loan from ubs financial services  inc  an affiliate of ubs ag  of approximately million  the full available amount 
the loan is secured by the ars and ars rights as collateral 
the funds may be required to be repaid by ubs upon demand and therefore  may be unavailable to support our operations if needed 
see note ubs loan 
based on our expected cash usage and our balance of cash and other investments  we do not anticipate the current illiquidity of the ars will affect our ability to operate our business as currently planned for at least months 
however  there can be no assurance as to the timing of when  or if the market for ars will recover in a manner that will allow us to receive a return of some or all that ubs 
table of contents will repurchase our ars of our principal or to meet our liquidity needs 
although our ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  if the illiquidity continues  these investments may be subject to a further decline in value  which would require us to recognize additional impairments in future periods 
we may also be required to sell these investments at prices significantly below par or assessed fair value 
ubs ag may not be able to maintain the financial resources necessary to satisfy its obligations with respect to the ars rights in a timely manner or at all 
we believe that the existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least months 
however  we expect that we will need to raise additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of hematide 
our current view of the worldwide capital markets is that they are extremely volatile with limited accessibility  and many biotechnology companies have been limited or unsuccessful in obtaining funding in this environment 
we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital  in the form of equity or otherwise  depending upon market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time 
continuation of this market may significantly limit our ability to raise funds such that there can be no assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations and maintain current development timelines  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  we have had to reduce our research capabilities and efforts  including the elimination of certain research programs  and even some activities related to the support of hematide 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we could be required to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
further  any strategic or licensing arrangements  if available  may require us to relinquish product rights that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
our future capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors and are not limited to the following the initiation  progress  timing and completion of pre clinical studies and clinical trials for hematide  our ability to maintain and achieve milestones under our collaboration agreements with takeda  costs of litigation  outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements  the number of drug candidates that we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims  timing and terms of future in licensing and out licensing transactions  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  cost of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of hematide and future product candidates  if any  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 

table of contents contractual obligations and significant commitments our future contractual obligations  including financing costs  at december  were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations long term income tax liability ubs loan total fixed contractual obligations with respect our long term income tax liability as of december   we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
the loan with ubs is classified as short term because we intend to repay it on june   the earliest date we may exercise our ars rights to require ubs to purchase the ars that collateralize the loan 
see note ubs loan 
in april  we entered into a license  manufacturing and supply agreement with nektar therapeutics al  corporation  or nektar  under which we obtained from nektar a worldwide  non exclusive license  with limited rights to grant sublicenses  to certain intellectual property covering pegylation technology to manufacture  develop and commercialize hematide 
in consideration of the license grant  we agreed to pay royalties on the sales of hematide 
we also agreed to pay milestone payments totaling up to million  plus possible additional milestones in connection with our partnering activities relating to hematide or merger and acquisition activities 
in july  we paid nektar a million milestone payment triggered by the collaboration agreements signed with takeda in february and june under the agreement  we also engaged nektar for the manufacture and supply of our requirements of bulk poly ethylene glycol reagent for the manufacture of hematide 
this relationship is managed by a managing committee formed by representatives from both us and nektar 
nektar is obligated to engage a third party manufacturer in the event of nektar s failure as defined in the agreement to supply reagent 
this agreement expires  on a country by country basis  upon the expiration of our royalty payment obligations 
the agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party s material breach provided that such other party has been given a chance to cure such breach  or by nektar for our challenge of the validity or enforceability of any patents licensed thereunder

 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update provides amendments to the criteria in asc topic  revenue recognition  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe 
if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
asu no 
also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
asu no 
is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of asu no 
will have on our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risks interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we do not believe that a decrease in interest rates would have a material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had fair value of ars totaling million that were comprised of municipal issuances that are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and a closed end preferred issuance 
the ars held by us are rated a through aaa by a major credit rating agency 
based on overall market liquidity concerns  we determined that there was a net decrease in fair value of ars totaling million as of december  in december  we obtained a loan of million under ars rights from ubs 
the loan bears interest at a rate that will not exceed the average rate of interest paid on the collateralized ars such that the net interest cost to us will be zero 
the weighted average interest rate on the loan was as of december  the table below presents the weighted average interest rates and related carrying amounts of our investment portfolio as of december  and weighted average interest rate carrying amount weighted average interest rate carrying amount in thousands in thousands cash equivalents short term investments long term investments 
table of contents foreign exchange risk we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies  and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
at each quarter end  we may have liabilities for costs incurred by overseas suppliers of goods or services and clinical trial programs that are denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged because of their relatively small size  uncertainty of payment date  and or short time until settlement 
an increase or decrease in exchange rates on these unhedged exposures may affect our operating results
