item a 
risk factors careful consideration should be given to the risk factors discussed below and the other information set forth in this report  any of which could materially affect our business  operations  financial position  liquidity and future results 
the risks described in this report are important to an understanding of the statements made in this report  in our other filings with the sec  and in any other discussion of our business 
these risk factors  which contain forward looking information  should be read in conjunction with item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this report 
the risks described in this report are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only risks facing the company 

table of contents the uncertain economic conditions could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the us economy has weakened significantly as a result of the recent global economic crisis and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
these economic conditions materially and adversely impact consumer confidence and consumer spending  our ability to forecast our continuing operations and operating results  our ability to execute and achieve our strategic  operational  restructuring and cost saving initiatives  our vendors and suppliers and the risk of any disruption in the supply of merchandise to us  our cash flows and other sources of funding of our continuing operations  strategic initiatives  restructure activities  debt service requirements  capital expenditures and the obligations arising in the operation of our business  and our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing at the times and in the amounts as may be needed 
we are unable to predict the likely duration or ultimate severity of the us economic conditions  and if the current and economic conditions further deteriorate  our business  continuing operations  financial results  liquidity and financial position could be increasingly materially and adversely impacted 
further  a sustained economic downturn would likely cause a number of the risks that we currently face to increase in likelihood and scope 
our ability to continue to have the liquidity necessary through cash flows from operations combined with our new senior secured revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to support operations 
on april   we completed our merger with bpw acquisition corp  a special purpose acquisition corporation bpw  which resulted in net cash proceeds of million before our acquisition costs 
we simultaneously closed a senior secured revolving credit facility with a third party lender the credit facility  which provides borrowing capacity up to million  subject to satisfaction of all borrowing conditions 
as a specialty retailer dependent upon consumer discretionary spending  we have been adversely affected by recent economic conditions  which have impacted sales  margins  cash flows  liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
while the funding received through the merger with bpw and related credit facility eliminated approaching debt maturities and assisted in our recapitalization  it does not provide assurance that the current economic environment will stabilize or improve in the near future or that we will generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations 
our ability to operate profitably and to generate positive cash flows is dependent upon many factors  including stabilization or improvement in economic conditions and consumer spending and our ability to successfully execute our long term financial plan and strategic initiatives 
in the event cash flows are not sufficient to support operations  it is uncertain whether the credit facility will be able to provide levels of cash in the amounts or at the time needed 
as such  the merger and refinancing does not provide assurance that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our company without additional financing or credit availability 
there can be no assurance that alternatives  if needed  would be successfully implemented  in which case it could materially adversely affect our company  its liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
our credit facility contains a borrowing base that is determined primarily by the level of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
if we do not have a sufficient borrowing base at any given time  borrowing availability under our credit facility may not be sufficient to support our liquidity needs 
insufficient borrowing availability under our credit facility would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
moreover  under the credit facility  we are subject to various covenants and requirements 
should we be unable to comply with any of the covenants and requirements in the credit facility  we would be unable to borrow under such credit facility  and any amounts outstanding would become immediately due and payable unless we were able to secure a waiver or an amendment under the credit agreement 
should we be unable to borrow under the credit facility we may likely not have the cash resources for our operations and if outstanding borrowings under the facility become immediately due and payable we likely would not have the cash resources to repay any such accelerated obligations  and in each case  our liquidity would be significantly impaired  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  the sufficiency and availability of our sources of liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors  including  without limitation i the level of our operating cash flows  which will be impacted by retailer and consumer acceptance of our merchandise  general economic conditions and the level of consumer discretionary 
table of contents spending  and ii our ability to maintain required levels of borrowing availability and to comply with applicable covenants included in our credit facility 
we cannot assure the successful implementation and results of our long term strategic initiatives and that we will continue to improve our operating results and return to long term profitability 
our ability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives and continue to improve our operating results depends upon a significant number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including sufficiency at all times of available cash flows and other internal and external cash resources to satisfy all future operating needs and all other cash requirements  the continuation or any further worsening of economic conditions  adequate and uninterrupted supply of merchandise and continuation of merchandise purchases on open account purchase terms from merchandise vendors at expected levels and at acceptable accounts payable terms  achieving our financial plan for operating results  working capital  liquidity and cash flows  whether our strategic initiatives and cost saving actions will continue to improve our results  operating efficiencies and cash flows  effective inventory management and maintaining adequate levels of customer appropriate inventory  our ability to adequately respond to greater competitive pressures  our ability to adequately respond to changing fashion trends and consumers response to our merchandise  and our ability to adjust our operating plans and cash expenditures in response to changing conditions 
we cannot provide assurance that any of these or other factors  plans and initiatives will be resolved or occur in our favor and  if not  our business  financial results  liquidity  sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to develop merchandise offerings that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers as well as our ability to continue to develop  evolve and promote our brand 
our future success depends on our ability to consistently anticipate  gauge and respond to our customers demands and tastes in the design  pricing  style and production of our merchandise 
our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately and in a timely manner to changes in customer preferences and economic conditions could lead to lower sales  missed opportunities  excessive inventories and more frequent markdowns  which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our sales levels 
merchandise misjudgments could also negatively impact our margins and markdown exposure  as well as our image with our customers  and result in diminished brand loyalty 
our future success also depends upon our ability to effectively define  evolve and promote our brand 
the talbots brand name and tradition transformed niche is integral to the success of our business 
maintaining  promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of the brand s design  merchandising and marketing efforts  and the ability to provide a consistent  high quality customer experience 
we need to continue to translate market trends into appropriate product offerings while minimizing excess inventory positions  and correctly balance the level of our merchandise commitments with actual customer orders 
our operating plan is based on a number of material assumptions that may not occur 
our fiscal operating plan is based on a number of significant assumptions which we developed based on our historical information  current and expected economic conditions  and expectations and perceptions of our near term and longer term sales  financial results and cost savings  as well as many other assumptions 
we have forecasted substantial cost savings from the strategic initiatives we implemented in the past  which if achieved 
table of contents would improve cash flows and liquidity 
the current economic environment makes it difficult to project or forecast the costs of and results to be achieved from these initiatives 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions or expectations will prove to be accurate and it is possible that actual events  actions taken and results actually achieved will be materially different  and could be more costly  than what we have assumed or forecasted  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
there are risks associated with the recent appointment of and transition to a new exclusive global merchandise buying agent 
in august  we reorganized our global sourcing activities and entered into a long term buying agency agreement with an affiliate of li fung limited li fung pursuant to which li fung was appointed as exclusive global apparel sourcing agent for substantially all of our apparel effective september there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits from this arrangement will be realized or within the time periods expected 
moreover  we cannot provide assurance that upon cessation of this relationship for any reason we would be able to successfully transition to an internal or other external sourcing function 
our overseas merchandise purchasing strategy makes it vulnerable to certain risks and any disruption in our supply of merchandise would materially impact us 
all of our merchandise is manufactured to our specifications by third party suppliers and intermediary vendors  most of whom are located outside the united states 
our arrangements with foreign suppliers and with our foreign buying agents are subject generally to the risks of doing business abroad  including political and economic instability  imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods that may be imported into the us from countries in a region where we do business  imposition of duties  taxes and other charges on imports  natural disasters and public health concerns  potential delays or disruption in shipping and related pricing impacts  and local business practices and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards 
continued difficult macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets could negatively impact our suppliers  which in turn  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
moreover  there is a risk that our suppliers and vendors could respond to any decrease or concern with our liquidity or negative financial results by requiring or conditioning their sale of merchandise to us on stringent payment terms  such as requiring standby letters of credit  earlier or advance payment of invoices or payment upon delivery  or other assurances or credit support 
there can be no assurance that one or more of our suppliers may not slow or cease shipments or require or condition their sale or shipment of merchandise on more stringent payment terms 
if this was to occur and we did not or were not able to adequately respond  it could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise 
we cannot predict whether the foreign countries in which our apparel and accessories are currently manufactured  or any of the foreign countries in which our apparel and accessories may be manufactured in the future  will be subject to import restrictions by the us government  including the likelihood  type or effect of any trade retaliation 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or more restrictive quotas  applicable to apparel items could affect the importation of apparel and  in that event  could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our operations 
we have an extensive  formal program requiring all of our manufacturers to comply with applicable labor laws and acceptable labor practices 
any failure to comply with applicable labor laws and practices by any of these manufacturers could materially harm our reputation with our customers as well as disrupt our supply of merchandise 

table of contents if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired  we may need to record significant non cash impairment charges 
we review the carrying value of our assets for potential impairment using a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and a market value approach 
if an impairment charge is identified  the carrying value is compared to our estimated fair value and an impairment charge is recorded as appropriate 
impairment losses are significantly impacted by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value 
our estimates of future operating cash flows are based upon our experience  knowledge and expectations  however  these estimates can be affected by such factors as our future operating results  future store profitability  and future economic conditions  all of which can be difficult to predict 
the carrying value of our assets may also be impacted by such factors as declines in stock price and in market capitalization 
the recent macro economic conditions impacted our performance and our market capitalization and it is difficult to predict how long these economic conditions will continue  whether they will continue to deteriorate  and which aspects of our business may be adversely affected 
these conditions and the continuation of these conditions could impact the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and could result in future material impairment charges  which would adversely impact our results of operations 
the costs to close underperforming stores may be significant and may negatively impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
we regularly assess our portfolio of stores for profitability and we close certain underperforming stores when appropriate under the circumstances 
our strategic and realignment plans include closing underperforming stores in order to reduce operating losses and to achieve improved long term profitability of our store base 
economic conditions may require us to close an increasing number of underperforming stores 
substantially all of our stores are leased  with lease terms continuing for up to ten years or more  and we have significant annual rent and other amounts due under each lease 
while in closing underperforming stores we endeavor to negotiate with landlords the amount of remaining lease obligations  there is no assurance we will reach acceptable negotiated lease settlements  particularly in the current economic environment 
as a result  costs to close underperforming stores may be significant and may negatively impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
the estimated costs and charges associated with store closings are also based on management s assumptions and projections and actual amounts may vary materially from our forecasts and expectations 
in connection with the sale in of the j 
jill business we remain contingently responsible for certain material risks and obligations 
in july  we completed the sale of the j 
jill brand business 
there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits from the sale of the j 
jill brand business will be realized in the time or amounts anticipated 
there also can be no assurance that the estimated or anticipated costs  charges and liabilities to settle and complete the transition and exit from the j 
jill brand business  including both retained obligations and contingent risk for assigned obligations  will not be materially differ from or be materially greater than anticipated 
in connection with the sale of the j 
jill business to j 
jill acquisition llc purchaser  the purchaser agreed to acquire and assume from us certain assets and liabilities relating to the j 
jill business 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  the purchaser is obligated for liabilities that arise after the closing under assumed contracts  which include leases for j 
jill stores assigned to the purchaser and a sublease through december of approximately  square feet of space at the company s  square foot leased office facility in quincy  massachusetts 
certain of our subsidiaries remain contingently liable for obligations and liabilities transferred to the purchaser  including those related to leases and other obligations transferred to and assumed by the purchaser  as to which obligations and liabilities we now rely on the purchaser s creditworthiness as counterparty 
if any material defaults were to occur which the purchaser does not satisfy or fully indemnify us against  it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have accrued a guarantee liability for the estimated exposure related to these guarantees  which is subject to future adjustment and could vary materially from estimated amounts 

table of contents we are subject to credit risk and to potential increased defaults and delinquencies on our customer charge card account portfolio 
we extend credit to our customers for merchandise purchases through our proprietary charge card facilities 
while we monitor our charge card account portfolio and we believe that our charge card account portfolio continues to be sound  the deteriorated economic environment and current high levels of unemployment may lead to higher customer delinquencies and defaults 
there can be no assurance that our credit risk monitoring or our monitoring of our charge card account portfolio will guard against or enable us to adequately and timely respond to any increased risk of or actual increased customer delinquencies or defaults  which could materially and negatively impact the value of our charge card portfolio  our results of operations and liquidity  and our borrowing base under our credit facility 
our credit facility contains provisions which may restrict our operations and proposed financing and strategic transactions 
under the terms of our credit facility  we cannot create  assume or suffer to exist any lien securing indebtedness incurred after the closing date of the facility subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in the credit facility 
the credit facility contains negative covenants prohibiting the company and its subsidiaries  with certain exceptions  from among other things  incurring indebtedness and contingent obligations  making investments  intercompany loans and capital contributions  and disposing of property or assets 
the credit facility agreement also contains customary representations  warranties and covenants relating to the company and its subsidiaries 
the agreement provides for events of default  including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement 
any of the above requirements or other restrictions and limitations under the credit facility could reduce our flexibility by limiting  without lender consent  our ability to borrow additional funds or enter into dispositions or collateralization transactions involving any of our assets or other significant transactions 
further  if we default under our credit facility  any amounts outstanding could become immediately due and payable prior to the maturity date  in which case absent replacement financing we would not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy this debt 
our success also depends upon our ability to maintain proper inventory levels 
our success depends upon our ability to manage proper inventory levels and respond quickly to shifts in consumer demand patterns 
if we overestimate customer demand for our merchandise  this will likely result in inventory markdowns and movement of the excessive inventory to our outlet facilities to be sold at discount or closeout prices which would negatively impact operating results and could impair our brand image 
if we underestimate customer demand for our merchandise  we may experience inventory shortages which may result in missed sales opportunities  negative impact on customer loyalty and loss of revenues 
the inability to fill customer orders efficiently could lower customer satisfaction and could cause customers to go to an alternate source for the desired products 
this lowered level of customer satisfaction and improper inventory levels could adversely affect our operations 
we may continue to experience fluctuations in operating results 
our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate 
among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are timing of holidays  weather  market acceptance of our products  product mix  pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold  the timing of merchandise receipts  our cost of merchandise  unanticipated operating costs  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the general economic conditions experienced over the past two years as well as actions of competitors 
as a result  period to period comparisons of historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
talented personnel are critical to our success 
our success and ability to properly manage our growth and to further develop and promote our brand depends to a significant extent on both the performance of our current executive and senior management team and our ability to attract  hire  motivate  and retain qualified and talented management personnel in the future 
in recent years  we 
table of contents have added a significant number of key senior executives in the areas of brand leadership  creative  merchandising  marketing  finance and sourcing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these senior executives and other key personnel or that these key hires will be successful in achieving or maintaining better sales and improved operating results or long term profitability for us 
our operations could be adversely affected if we cannot attract qualified personnel to re fill existing positions or build new positions and departments within the organization and retain all of our key personnel 
our dependence on a single distribution facility 
we handle merchandise distribution for all of our stores from a single facility in lakeville  massachusetts 
independent third party transportation companies deliver our merchandise to our stores and our clients 
any significant interruption in the operation of the distribution facility or the domestic transportation infrastructure due to natural disasters  accidents  inclement weather  epidemics  system failures  work stoppages  slowdowns or strikes by employees of the transportation companies  or other unforeseen causes could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores  which could result in lower sales  a loss of loyalty to our brands and excess inventory 
a major failure of our information systems could harm the business 
we depend on information systems to manage our operations 
our information systems consist of a full range of retail  financial  and merchandising systems  including credit  inventory distribution and control  sales reporting  accounts payable  budgeting and forecasting  financial reporting  merchandise reporting and distribution 
we regularly make investments to upgrade  enhance or replace such systems and believe they meet industry standards 
any delays or difficulties in transitioning to these new systems  or in integrating these systems with our current systems  or any disruptions affecting our information systems  could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
the outcome of litigation and other claims is unpredictable

the defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint and intend to defend against the claims vigorously

we generally have been successful in renewing our store leases as they expire 
under most leases  provisions include a fixed annual base rent plus a contingent rent percentage rent based on the store s annual sales in excess of specified levels 
in a majority of leases  we have a right to terminate earlier than the specified expiration date if certain sales levels are not achieved  such right is usually exercisable after five years of operation

talbots cannot accurately predict the likelihood of a favorable or unfavorable outcome or quantify the amount or range of potential financial impact  if any 
talbots is periodically named as a defendant in various lawsuits  claims and pending actions and is exposed to tax risks 
if a potential loss arising from these lawsuits  claims and pending actions is probable and reasonably estimable  talbots records the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time 
while talbots believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in projecting the outcome of these matters and in the estimation process whereby future actual liabilities may exceed projected liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on the talbots financial condition and results of operations 
talbots is subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and  as a matter of course  is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
during the third quarter of  the massachusetts appellate tax board rendered an adverse decision on certain tax matters of talbots 
we are actively appealing that decision

business overview on april   we completed the bpw transactions 
the acquisition resulted in net proceeds from bpw of million 
simultaneously  we borrowed million under our new credit facility and  combined with our cash on hand  we repaid all of our outstanding debt with our former majority shareholder 
immediately following the combined transactions  our debt was reduced by million and our equity increased by approximately million before our acquisition costs 
we believe the completion of these transactions significantly strengthens our balance sheet and positions us for future growth 
the following is a summary of our highlights achieved total revenues of  million improved gross margin by approximately basis points 
table of contents reduced expenses by million as part of our million cost reduction program  including million in selling  general and administrative and million in cost of sales  buying and occupancy improved inventory management and reduced inventory levels by compared to formed strategic alliance with global sourcing partner  li fung re launched talbots internet shopping site with enhanced functionality  features and personalization launched upscale outlets in may offering merchandise manufactured exclusively for this concept reduced operating loss from million in to million in improved brand and merchandise perception according to consumer purchase plan study despite the continued economic challenges during  we achieved operating income in the third and fourth quarters of after five consecutive quarters of operating losses  reflecting significant progress in executing our strategic plan 
in addition  during the fourth quarter our net sales increased for the second consecutive quarter 
looking ahead to and beyond we are very pleased with the improvement in our operating performance over the course of particularly in the second half of the year 
we expect to carry this momentum from our operating initiatives into with continued progress in evolving our merchandise offering  inventory management and cost control 
we expect to continue to invest in our key growth initiatives including upscale outlets  our merchandise categories including accessories  our direct channel internet business and productivity improvements from store segmentation  as well as our other store based productivity initiatives 
results of operations cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses are comprised primarily of the cost of product merchandise  including duties  inbound freight charges  shipping  handling and distribution costs associated with our catalog operations  salaries and expenses incurred by our merchandising and buying operations  and occupancy costs associated with our retail stores 
occupancy costs consist primarily of rent and associated depreciation  maintenance  property taxes and utilities

warehouse operations costs for  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our gross margins may not be comparable to certain other companies  as there is diversity in practice as to which costs companies include in selling  general and administrative expenses and cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses

we believe this was a carryover from the latter part of as the difficult economic environment significantly influenced consumers discretionary spending 
when our customer was shopping  key fashion items at entry level price points were the main driver of sales 
we remained steadfast in managing on lean inventory while improving our flow of merchandise  optimizing our markdowns and presenting our customer with a stronger mix of full price to markdown merchandise 
sales metrics for were as follows customer traffic declined and the rate of converting traffic to transactions declined  resulting in a decline in the number of transactions 
additionally  units per transaction were down  with a increase in average unit retail  resulting in a decline in dollars per transaction 
we began to see improvement in our sales metrics beginning in the third quarter which continued through the end of the year 
although we experienced a decline in fourth quarter traffic and transactions  dollars per transaction increased reflecting an improvement in full price selling 
despite a year over year decline in sales and certain other related metrics  we have reason to believe that customer perception of our merchandise continued to improve 
market research we conducted during the third quarter indicated that our best customers  those who spend the most money shopping with us  gave our merchandise its highest rating in recent years 
our lower spenders also rated our merchandise at its highest levels in recent years  although not as high as our best customers 

table of contents as of january   we operated a total of stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet 
this represents a decrease of approximately in gross and selling square footage  respectively  from january   when we operated retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
the decrease in square footage is due to the opening of upscale outlets and one retail store offset by the closing of retail stores 
direct marketing sales we experienced an decline in direct marketing sales in compared to while the percentage of our net sales derived from direct marketing increased to in from in the increase in the direct marketing as a percent of total sales is partially due to more aggressive selling and promoting of our direct marketing sales that originate in our stores via red line phones  which are direct lines to our telemarketing center 
also contributing to the improvement  beginning in the fall season  we presented our customer with a stronger mix of full price merchandise  achieved better fulfillment and experienced lower returns 
direct marketing sales in the third quarter were essentially flat compared to the prior year and we experienced an increase in the fourth quarter on a year over year basis 
internet sales in represented of our direct marketing sales compared to in we believe our investment in our new internet platform coupled with changing trends in consumer purchasing behavior  contributed to the increase in internet sales as a percentage of direct marketing 
cost of sales  buying  and occupancy expenses the following is a comparison of cost of sales  buying and occupancy expense for and january  january  decrease in millions cost of sales  buying and occupancy expense percentage of net sales the decrease in cost of sales  buying and occupancy expense represents a basis point improvement from the prior year 
the improvement includes a basis point improvement in product gross margin as a percent of sales 
the improvement in product gross margin was driven by changes to our sourcing practices  disciplined inventory management and strong full price selling specifically in the second half of the year 
the improvement in cost of sales is offset by a basis point increase in occupancy costs and a basis point increase in buying costs  both of which rose as a percent of sales despite reductions in actual costs 
these increases as a percent of sales are attributable to negative leverage from the decline in sales for the year  as actual costs for occupancy and buying were reduced from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following is a comparison of selling  general and administrative expenses for and january  january  decrease in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales in early  we established a goal of reducing annual expenses by million by the end of fiscal approximately of this reduction was expected to be within selling  general and administrative expenses 
by the end of fiscal  we reduced expenses by million  substantially achieving our two year goal in one year

additionally  we reorganized our global sourcing activities and entered into a buying agency agreement with li fung effective september li fung is now our exclusive global apparel sourcing agent for substantially all talbots apparel 
merger costs in  we incurred million of merger costs in connection with our acquisition of bpw 
these costs primarily consist of investment banking and professional services fees 
approximately million of additional transaction related costs including management and key employee incentive and retention expenses are expected to be incurred during and impairment of store assets the following is a comparison of impairment charges for and january  january  decrease in millions impairment of store assets percentage of net sales we closely monitor our store portfolio to identify stores that are underperforming and close stores when appropriate 
when we determine that a store is underperforming or is to be closed  we reassess the expected future cash flows of the store  which in some cases results in an impairment charge 
during the third quarter of  we identified and recorded an impairment charge of million related to underperforming stores 
net interest expense january  january  increase in millions net interest expense average debt outstanding average interest rate on borrowings the increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt levels combined with a higher average interest rate on those borrowings 
interest expense in also includes million of amortization of the million loan fees paid to aeon in and million of breakage fees resulting from our early repayment of the bank debt on december  income tax benefit expense the following is a comparison of income tax benefit expense for and january  january  decrease in millions income tax benefit expense 
table of contents the income tax benefit in resulted primarily from the intraperiod tax allocation arising from other comprehensive income recognized from the remeasurement of our pension plan and serp obligations due to our decision to freeze future benefits under the plans effective as of may  this resulted in a tax expense of approximately million in other comprehensive income and an offsetting benefit in continuing operations 
the income tax expense in is due to the establishment of a valuation allowance of million for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded there was insufficient evidence that all of our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future 
compared to net sales the following is a comparison of net sales for and january  february  decrease in millions net retail store sales net direct marketing sales total retail stores reflected in talbots retail store sales was a million  or  decline in comparable store sales for the period  driven by a decline in transactions 
we believe that the negative sales results were impacted by a weak customer response to the brand s spring merchandise and timing of promotional events earlier in the year  coupled with the effects from the economic crisis and pressures on consumer spending later in the year 
we began to see a steep decline in customer traffic in mid september as the financial crisis unfolded 
throughout the remainder of the year  it was more challenging to drive customer traffic as we believe that our customer was becoming more cautious and thoughtful regarding her discretionary spending given the substantial economic uncertainty 
as a result  we were forced to become more promotional than originally planned which negatively impacted our margins 
despite the environment in the fall season  we did see a positive response to our reinvigorated merchandise and marketing efforts during that time 
the third quarter marked the first deliveries under the direction of our new creative  merchandising and marketing teams 
the new deliveries in the fall season were complemented with new floor sets and major redesigned catalogs 
although we believe our improvements to the brand were received well by our customers  our sales could not withstand the continued deterioration and uncertainty of the us economy 
for the fourth quarter of  our comparable store sales declined 
as of january   we operated a total of retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
this represents a decrease of approximately in gross and selling square footage from february   when we operated retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
direct marketing sales the decline in direct marketing sales was primarily due to the effects of the economic environment and a misjudgment in inventory commitments related to our sale book that dropped in december 
the catalog received a positive response and we were unable to fulfill approximately of customer demand from the sale book 
additionally  we shifted the mailing of our key holiday gift catalog into november in versus october in the prior year 
we expected this change to benefit our fourth quarter direct marketing sales 
because of the difficult economic environment  our fourth quarter results did not benefit from this change 
mainly because of these actions  we experienced a million decline in net sales in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year 

table of contents in  as part of our strategic initiatives  we increased circulation for the talbots brand and developed innovative marketing strategies in order to strengthen relations with our existing customer  prospect new customers and drive reactivation of our existing lapsed customer in hopes to drive catalog and internet channel sales 
we believe our efforts yielded a solid increase in response rate  especially with our existing lapsed customers 
the internet channel continued to be an important component of direct marketing sales  with internet representing of the direct business in in comparison to in we have made enhancements to our website in  offering enhanced visuals and greater ease of functionality and plan to create a fresh platform of our e commerce site in the percentage of our net sales derived from direct marketing increased slightly from in to in cost of sales  buying  and occupancy expenses the following is a comparison of cost of sales  buying and occupancy expense for and january  february  increase decrease in millions cost of sales  buying and occupancy expense percentage of net sales we experienced a basis point increase in cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales over the prior year with product gross margin decreasing by approximately basis points 
despite the significant decline in sales  especially in the fourth quarter  our efforts in inventory management allowed us to maintain relatively flat product margins with the prior year 
our efforts included tighter control of inventory levels  improved initial mark on  the change to a monthly markdown cadence and a consistent flow of new merchandise across channels 
additionally  an approximate basis point increase was driven by higher occupancy costs as a percentage of sales 
as occupancy costs are primarily fixed costs  the basis point increase is fully attributable to the decline in sales for the period 
we also experienced an approximate basis point increase in merchandising costs as a percentage of sales  which is attributable to the deleverage associated with the decline in store sales for the period 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following is a comparison of selling  general and administration expenses for and january  february  increase decrease in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales we experienced a basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales over the prior year 
while we believed that we made progress in executing our strategic initiatives  including streamlining the organization and reducing expenses for our overall cost structure in  we had not yet begun to benefit from the implementations 
in  we spent approximately million in business development costs  or approximately basis points  relating to non restructuring initiatives 
the costs were primarily relating to professional services 
any savings that we were able to achieve in were offset by negative leverage from the decline in sales during the period 
our primary area of savings in was due to our decision to eliminate television and national print advertising 
we spent million less  or approximately basis points  during for marketing programs in comparison to additionally  we reduced our vacation accrual by million in due to a change in our vacation policy that became effective on january

when we determine that a store is underperforming or is to be closed  we reassess the expected future cash flows of the store  which in some cases results in an impairment charge 
goodwill and other intangible assets our policy is to evaluate goodwill and trademarks for impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level on the first day of each fiscal year  and more frequently  if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or trademarks should be evaluated 
in the third quarter of  our operating results were lower than expected 
based on this trend  we updated our forecasts during the third quarter and management performed an interim impairment test on our goodwill and trademarks 
we determined that no impairment our goodwill or trademarks existed for the talbots brand 
as a result of the significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization in the fourth quarter of  we performed an additional interim test for impairment 
in the fourth quarter  we finalized our budget and long term plan  evaluating current industry trends  and the impact that the uncertainty in the financial markets may have on our business and our impairment analysis 
we determined that no impairment of our goodwill or trademarks existed for the talbots brand 
our industry continues to be materially impacted by the deterioration of the us economic environment and we believe that the effects will continue 
as such  we may be required to perform additional tests of impairment on our goodwill and intangible assets which may result in significant charges

the term loan facility initially matured on august   but provided us with the option to extend the maturity for additional six month periods  up to the third anniversary of the loan closing date  which was february  as of february  we converted all of our working capital lines of credit with our banks  amounting to million in the aggregate  to committed lines with maturities in december in april  aeon guaranteed our outstanding debt under our then existing working capital facilities totaling million  our then existing revolving credit facilities totaling million  and our then existing million term loan facility 
aeon also agreed i that it would agree to continue to provide a guaranty for a refinancing of any of that debt  which then matured at various dates on and before april  and ii if the lender failed to agree to refinance that debt on or before the then existing maturity date  or if any other condition occurred that required aeon to make a payment under its then existing guaranty  aeon would make a loan to us  due on or after april  and within the limits of aeon s then existing loan guaranty  to avoid any lack of our financial resources caused by any such failure of refinancing 
in april  aeon also confirmed its support for our working capital improvements initiatives for our merchandise payables management and that it would use commercially reasonable effort to provide us with financial support through loan or guarantee up to million only if  and to the extent that  we fell short in achieving our targeted cash flow improvement for fall merchandise payables

in order to more effectively manage our accounts payable and cash positions due to our sales trends and cash needs  during the second half of and into  we extended many of our accounts payable terms from secured letters of credit to open account terms payable in approximately days after shipment 
this has improved our cash position and accounts payable management and we intend to seek to continue these accounts payable and cash management practices going forward 

table of contents debt facilities at january   we had existing credit facilities providing an aggregate of million of financing through the aeon facility  aeon loan and amended facility  all of which are with related parties 
our outstanding borrowings totaled million at january   including million  million and million outstanding under the aeon facility  aeon loan and amended facility  respectively 
at january   we had million available for future borrowing under the amended facility 
the aeon facility was an interest only loan at january  which was to mature on january  the aeon loan was an interest only loan at january  which was to mature on august   but provided us with the option to extend the maturity for additional six month periods  up to the third anniversary of the loan closing date  which was february  the amended facility carried monthly interest payments at january  and had a scheduled maturity date of the earlier to occur of i april  or ii the consummation of the bpw transactions  provided that the merger transaction together with any concurrent financing results in sufficient net cash proceeds to enable us to make full repayment of our aeon debt

upon the consummation and closing of the bpw transactions  million was outstanding under the credit facility 
fiscal our ability to obtain additional financing as needed depends upon many factors  including our financial projections and our prospects and creditworthiness  as well as external economic conditions and general liquidity in the credit markets 
based on our current assumptions  our forecast and operating and cash flow plan for  our borrowing availability under the new senior secured revolving credit agreement and the restructuring of the company s capital structure  we anticipate that the company will have sufficient liquidity to finance anticipated working capital and other expected cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our ability to meet our cash needs and satisfy our operating and other non operating costs will depend upon  among other factors  our future operating performance as well as general economic conditions 
cash flows during  we generated net cash flows of million  including million from discontinued operations  versus a net use of cash of million in the million of net cash flow from discontinued operations in was due to the sale of our j 
jill business for net cash proceeds of million in july 
table of contents the following is a summary of our cash flows from continuing operations in  and in thousands january  january  february  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in due to the lower operating loss and lower investment in working capital 
the lower investment in working capital was due primarily to lower merchandise inventory levels and a million refund of prior years tax payments 
the lower operating loss  despite a decline in revenues  and lower inventory levels were the result of actions taken by us over and to reduce operating costs  maintain leaner inventories and improve gross margins 
we are comfortable with our merchandise inventory levels with our improved product flow enabling us to operate in on a lower inventory level compared to cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased million to million in due to our planned decline in spending on new store openings  store renovations  and information technology due to the uncertain economic environment 
during  we opened new upscale outlet stores and converted seven existing stores into upscale outlet stores 
in addition  we also opened one new talbot s store  and closed others 
the balance of our capital expenditures in was focused on a platform refresh of our e commerce site and the renovation and refurbishment of certain of our existing stores 
we expect to increase our capital spending to approximately million in with capital outlays expected to be focused on opening additional upscale outlet stores and funding other growth initiatives 
cash provided by used in financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million in from million in our financing activities in were focused on improving our debt maturity schedule and terms of our outstanding indebtedness 
during  we borrowed million  including million from aeon and aeon usa  and repaid million of outstanding debt  including million of third party bank indebtedness 
in  we paid aeon million of the net proceeds from sale of the j 
jill business in accordance with the terms of the aeon loan 
our outstanding debt totaled million at january  as compared to million at january  critical accounting policies the preparation of the our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  retirement plans  impairment of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
the estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates if actual events or experience were different from their assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
however  there is no assurance that such judgments and estimates will reflect actual results or that such estimates or their underlying assumptions may not need to change materially in the future to reflect actual experience 

table of contents inventory markdown reserve 
merchandise inventory is a significant asset on our balance sheet  representing approximately of our total assets at january  historically  we managed our inventory levels by typically holding four major sale events per year in our stores and our catalog  consisting of two mid season sales and two end of season clearance sales 
these events served to liquidate remaining inventory at the end of each selling season after which remaining goods were transferred to our outlet stores 
in november  we changed our markdown cadence from our historical four clearance events per year to markdowns on a monthly basis 
consistent with the retail inventory method  at the end of each reporting period  reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining markdown past season inventory 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of past season inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns on this same merchandise 
the future markdown rate is reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 
historically  the difference between management s estimates and actual markdowns has not been significant 
if market conditions were to further decline or customer acceptance of product was not favorable  we may have excess inventory on hand and may be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  resulting in an incremental charge to earnings 
we believe that at january  and january   the markdown reserve was appropriate based on current past season inventory levels  historical markdown trends  and forecasts of future sales of past season inventory 
the markdown reserve rate of past season inventory was and at january  and january   respectively 
a basis point increase or decrease in this rate would impact pre tax income by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
sales return reserve 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns through both of our catalog and store locations 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels and projected future return levels 
our estimated sales returns are periodically compared to actual sales returns 
historically  the difference between the estimated sales returns and actual sales returns has not been significant 
if customer acceptance of the product was not favorable or the product quality were to deteriorate  future actual returns may increase  resulting in a higher return rate and increased charges to earnings 
we believe that the reserve balances at january  and january   of million and million  respectively  were appropriate based on current sales return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
customer loyalty program 
we maintain a customer loyalty program referred to as our classic awards program in which talbots us customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching specified purchase levels 
our classic awards program was relaunched in january with the addition of non charge based loyalty incentives and additional incentives for customers who spend more than  per year on their talbots charge card 
prior to january  our classic awards program was only available to our customers who used talbots charge cards for their purchases and the incentives were the same for everyone  regardless of annual spend 
our classic awards program has three defined tiers of participation  each of which enables our customers to earn points for every purchase made with us  whether in store  online or via catalog 
once a customer earns points  they receive a appreciation award to be redeemed on a future merchandise purchase 
appreciation awards  by their terms  expire one year from the date of issuance 
other benefits of classic awards membership include birthday bonus percentage off coupons and other special offers and promotions such as double points 
the three tiers of our classic awards program include classic awards red purchases are not required to be made on a talbots charge card  and customers earn rewards for merchandise purchases regardless of their method of payment 
members receive a point for every spent 

table of contents classic awards platinum customers are enrolled automatically when they open a talbots charge card  and customers earn rewards for merchandise purchases made with their talbots charge card 
members receive point for every spent 
classic awards black comprised of customers who spend a minimum of  annually on their talbots charge card  and customers earn rewards for merchandise purchases made with their talbots charge card 
members receive points for every spent 
customers who are talbots charge card holders may enroll in classic awards red if they wish to earn points on purchases that are not made using their talbots charge card 
appreciation award expense is recognized at the time of the initial customer purchase and is charged to selling  general and administrative expenses based on purchase levels  actual awards issued  and historical redemption rates 
each month  we perform an analysis of the accrual account balance for each of the three tiers and factor in the outstanding unredeemed awards  actual redemptions  and the level of award points earned  and based on that analysis  adjust the respective liability and expense as applicable by tier 
we also perform a monthly analysis of issuances and redemptions to identify trends in the redemption rate 
several key statistics are monitored regularly  including expense as a percentage of sales  redemptions as a percentage of sales  and cumulative redemptions 
trends in these statistics are then factored into both the initial expense and the analysis of the liability account 
actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates used in our liability analysis based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could result in additional expense 
we believe that the accrual balances at january  and january  were appropriate based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 
a change in redemptions or issuances would have changed pre tax income by approximately million in and  respectively 
retirement plans 
we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all full time talbots brand and shared service employees hired on or before december   two non qualified supplemental executive retirement plans collectively  the serp for certain talbots brand current and former key executives impacted by internal revenue code limits  and we provide certain medical benefits for most talbots brand retired employees under postretirement medical plans 
in calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense  we make various assumptions and estimates 
the annual determination of expense involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to our plan participants and allocating this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
prior to  the plans were valued annually as of december st 
in accordance with new accounting guidance  the measurement date was changed to our fiscal year end effective january  in february  we announced our decision to freeze the pension plan and serp effective may  as a result of the decision made in february to freeze the plans  a remeasurement occurred as of february  the remeasurement resulted in a decrease to other liabilities of million and million for the pension plan and serp  respectively  and an increase to other comprehensive income of million and million  net of tax  for the pension plan and serp  respectively 
significant assumptions related to the calculation of our obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan  the average rate of compensation increase by certain plan participants  and the assumed healthcare trend rates on the postretirement medical plans 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate is based  in part  upon a discount rate modeling process that involves applying a methodology which matches the future benefit payment stream to a discount curve yield for the plan 
the discount rate is used principally to calculate the actuarial present value of our obligation and periodic expense attributable to our employee benefits plans 
at january  and january   the discount rate used for the pension plan was 
the discount rates used for the serp were and at january  and january   respectively 
to the extent that the discount rate increases or decreases  our obligations are decreased or increased accordingly 
a basis point change in the discount rates would have impacted our pre tax income by approximately million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents the expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based on an analysis which considers actual net returns for the pension plan since inception  ibbotson associates historical investment returns data for the three major classes of investments in which we invest debt  equity  and foreign securities for the period since the pension plan s inception and for the longer period commencing when the return data was first tracked  and expectations of future market returns from outside sources for the three major classes of investments in which we invest 
this rate is used primarily in estimating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than or more than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this loss or gain adjusts future pension expense over approximately five years 
we used a rate of and as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at january  and january   respectively 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have impacted our pre tax income by million and million in and  respectively 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is based on historical and expected compensation increases 
we utilized a rate of for both periods beginning february  and january  this rate is used principally to estimate the retirement obligation and annual expense 
an increase in the assumed average rate of compensation increase from to would have decreased our pre tax income by million in and million in the assumed health care expense trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement medical plans 
the healthcare cost escalation rate is used to determine the postretirement obligation and annual expense 
at january  and january   we used and  respectively  as initial cost escalation rates that gradually trend down to 
to the extent that these rates increase or decrease  our obligation and associated expense are increased or decreased accordingly 
a increase in the assumed health care trend rate would have no material impact on our pre tax income in or we believe that the assumptions used in calculating the liabilities under our retirement plans and postretirement medical plan as of january  and january  were reasonable 
long lived assets 
we periodically review the depreciation and amortization periods of long lived assets to determine whether current circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we monitor our assets for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment is identified  a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
the calculation of an impairment loss is significantly impacted by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value 
our estimates of future operating cash flows are based upon our experience  knowledge and expectations 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors that can be difficult to predict  such as our future operating results  future store profitability and future economic conditions 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges 
additionally  our initiative to continue to critically assess individual store profitability on an ongoing basis in an effort to restore profitability could result in an increased number of closed stores  resulting in larger impairment charges in future periods 
we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million relating to store assets during  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test our goodwill and trademarks for impairment at the reporting unit level on the first day of each fiscal year  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or trademarks should be evaluated 
we use a two step process for determining whether goodwill is impaired 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value  we perform a second step to calculate the goodwill impairment 
in the second step  we determine the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 

table of contents to determine fair value  we use a combination of the income approach  which is based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future  and the market value approach 
the income approach requires significant judgments and estimates to project future revenues and expenses  changes in gross margins  cash flows and estimates of future capital expenditures for the reporting unit over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
we believe the discount rate we used is consistent with the risks inherent in our business and with the retail industry 
we also use the market approach to estimate fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples of operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating characteristics similar to the reporting units 
our evaluation of goodwill inherently involves judgments as to assumptions used to project these amounts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
our estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other matters  economic conditions  changes to our business model  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect our future financial results 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a negative change in our assumptions  namely a increase in the discount rate  a decrease in the market approach multiple or a decrease in forecasted earnings  would not have resulted in a change in our conclusions in and the computed fair value of the stores reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value by a significant margin 
we compare the fair value of the trademarks to their carrying value to determine whether the asset is impaired 
fair value is determined based on the income approach using the relief of royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of the asset 
this approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future sales  royalty rates of intellectual property  discount rates and other variables 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect our future financial results 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a negative change in our assumptions  as follows  would have resulted in the following additional impairment charges in and additional impairment charge increase in discount rate no effect no effect basis point decrease in royalty rate no effect million decrease in revenue growth rate no effect no effect see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item for further discussion of goodwill and trademarks 
income taxes 
we record deferred income taxes to recognize the effect of temporary differences between tax and financial statement reporting 
we calculate the deferred taxes using enacted tax rates expected to be in place when the temporary differences are realized 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if it is subsequently determined that a deferred tax asset will more likely than not be realized  we record a credit to earnings to reduce the allowance 
in determining the tax benefit resulting from a loss from continuing operations we consider all sources of income including discontinued operations  extraordinary items  other comprehensive income and other components of equity 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including recent earnings results  expectations of future taxable income  carry forward periods available  and other relevant factors 
changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in the period that the determination is made 
we determined in and that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits from our deferred tax assets  and have recorded a valuation allowance for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets  after considering sources of taxable income from reversing deferred tax liabilities 
there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax 
table of contents benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  the associated interest and penalties have also been recognized 
we classify uncertain tax positions as non current income tax liabilities unless expected to be resolved within one year 
we classify interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense  interest income from income tax refunds in interest income  and penalties in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we are routinely under audit by various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
there is significant judgment that is required in determining our provision for income taxes  such as our mix and level of earnings  changes in tax laws or rates  changes in the expected outcome of audits  the expiration of the statute of limitations on some tax positions  and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause us to change our estimates 
changes in estimates may create volatility in our effective tax rate in future periods and may materially affect our results of operations 
we believe that our accruals for income taxes are appropriate at january   january  and february  stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation based on the fair value of the equity awards at the date of grant 
we recognize stock based compensation expense  less estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from those estimates 
to determine the fair value of options  we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires us to make subjective assumptions  including estimates of the expected life of the option  estimates of the volatility of the our common stock price over the expected life  expected dividend rate  and the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon bond issues with a term approximately equal to the expected life of the options 
the expected life of the option represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules  historical exercise patterns  and expectations of future exercise patterns 
the expected volatility of our common stock price is based primarily upon historical volatilities of our stock from public data sources and also considers implied factors that may influence our volatility 
the expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated annual payment of dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on data derived from public sources regarding us treasury zero coupon bond issues 
our estimates of expected volatility and expected life have the greatest impact on determining the fair value of options granted 
if the expected volatility or expected life were to increase  the fair value of the stock award would be higher resulting in increased compensation charges 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we utilized different assumptions  the recorded stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
the fair value of nonvested stock awards and restricted stock units is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and the related stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the vesting period on awards granted as performance accelerated nonvested stock is a five year period  but can be accelerated to three years after the grant date depending on the achievement of certain corporate financial goals 
if we determine that the achievement of certain corporate financial goals is probable where we previously concluded that achievement of the goals would not occur  then the vesting period would be reduced at that time and the related expense amounts would increase 
certain shares of nonvested stock are time vested generally between periods of two to four years 
restricted stock units generally vest over one year 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 
we compare actual forfeitures with estimates and revise our estimates if differences occur 
if actual forfeitures rates are lower than our estimates  our compensation expense would increase 
conversely  if actual forfeitures are greater than our estimates  our compensation expense would decrease 
our results of operations will be impacted by differences between estimated and actual forfeitures 
a decrease in the assumed forfeiture rate would have decreased our pre tax income by less than million in  million in and in 
table of contents the impact of share based compensation expense on our results of operations  including net income and earnings per diluted share  will depend on  among other factors  the number of equity awards granted  the market price of our shares at the date of grant and the various other assumptions used in valuing such awards

the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates for this variable rate debt would have caused an additional pre tax charge of million for the year ended january  we enter into certain purchase obligations outside the united states which are predominately settled in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not material
