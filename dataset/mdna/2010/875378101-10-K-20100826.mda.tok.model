item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item should be read in the context of the information included elsewhere in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item of this annual report 
overview we are organized along product categories and have two reportable segments accessories  which includes belts and small leather goods  eyewear  neckwear  and sporting goods and gifts 
the overall negative retail environment and general economic conditions which the global economy began to experience over two years ago are showing signs of modest improvement  but there seems to be little consensus on when a complete economic recovery may occur 
like most companies in the retail industry  our net sales  and resulting profitability  have been severely impacted beginning in fiscal our customers continue to take a very conservative approach toward replenishing inventory in this environment 
as a result  we have made the necessary adjustments internally to respond to these indications  and we continue to work closely with our retail partners to develop products and programs to fit their needs and the current environment 
due to a decline in sales on certain of our trade names during fiscal  we were required to assess the assets for impairment 
based upon expected future sales  we determined that no impairment existed  however  if actual future sales are less than expected  an impairment may be recorded in future periods 
in connection with the consolidation of our operations in yoakum  texas into our dallas  texas distribution facility and other organizational restructuring actions  we recorded charges for termination payments million  relocation costs  and other costs 
for the year  we had net income of million  or per share 
in fiscal  we had a net loss of million  or per share 
the following table presents sales and gross margin data for our business segments in thousands of dollars 
other financial information about our segments is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
net sales accessories gifts gross margin accessories gifts gross margin percent of sales accessories gifts total operating expenses accessories gifts 
table of contents the following presents selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  depreciation and amortization  and our interest expenses which are not directly allocated to one of our segments in thousands of dollars 
selling  general and administrative expenses unallocated restructuring charges acquisition related costs depreciation and amortization interest expense our sales are generally affected by changes in demand for our product categories volume as well as customer allowances and returns 
sales volume also can impact our gross margins in terms of product mix between mass merchant retailers  which typically sell product at lower price points than department stores  and specialty retailers 
the components of our cost of goods sold and sg a are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and incorporated herein by reference 
we include the costs related to our distribution network in sg a while others may include all or a portion of such costs in their cost of goods sold 
consequently  our gross margins may not be comparable to others 
the following table presents net sales for each of our product categories in thousands of dollars 
belts gifts small leather goods other operationally  our most significant accomplishments in fiscal were maintaining gross margins and controlling sg a expenses for fiscal as organic net sales excluding sales attributable to the chambers acquisition declined from fiscal  acquiring certain assets of chambers and integrating the business into our operations  and consolidating our facilities  including relocating our headquarters from arlington  texas to our existing dallas distribution center and relocating distribution facilities from yoakum  texas to dallas  texas 
compared to net sales and gross margins our million fiscal net sales were higher than the prior year with an improved gross margin of 
the gross margin in fiscal on net sales of million included an inventory write down effect of percentage points 
accessories segment net sales of million in fiscal were above the million in fiscal primarily due to strong belt sales attributable to the chambers acquisition chambers sales of million 
the accessories segment net sales increase driven by chambers sales was offset by lower sales due to our fiscal inventory sku rationalization program which reduced sales of low margin and low volume products  lost sales in fiscal to customers who suffered severe financial difficulties  including bankruptcy in  and reduced inventory assortments at certain customers 
gross margin dollars in fiscal generally were higher as the result of chambers sales million gross margin dollars in fiscal and a million inventory write down from the prior year which negatively impacted the prior year margin percentage by percentage points 
the margin percentage of net sales for our accessories segment in fiscal improved by percentage points over fiscal due to the inventory write down in the prior year million  or margin percentage points 
the margin percentage of net sales for our gifts segment in fiscal improved by percentage points over fiscal due to the inventory write down in the prior year million  or margin percentage points and improved product sourcing million  or margin percentage points 
operating expenses total segment operating expenses in fiscal of million were more than million lower than the prior year million primarily due to lower distribution and salaries and benefits costs in fiscal and a million lower doubtful accounts receivable provision 

table of contents total sg a of million for fiscal was million less than that incurred in million 
the reductions were primarily due to decreases in expenses such as bad debt provisions  salaries and benefits  travel and professional services 
we incurred acquisition related costs of  during the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the chambers transaction 
as further described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report  incorporated herein by reference  we recognized an additional  of acquisition related costs in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal depreciation and amortization for fiscal was  higher than in as a result of acquiring the customer list and equipment in the chambers transaction and from capital expenditures relating to our dallas  texas facility 
interest and taxes interest expense for fiscal was  higher than that incurred in this increase was primarily attributable to higher debt cost amortization and higher outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the chambers acquisition earn out liability discount amortization of  the carryback of our fiscal net operating loss as the result of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  which became law in november  resulted in million of refundable income taxes paid for the fiscal period which was collected in fiscal because we incurred a net loss in fiscal and fiscal  we have a remaining federal income tax net loss carryover of million expiring in and our effective income tax rates were a negative and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in both years the benefits of the federal statutory rate applied to our pretax losses were offset by deferred tax valuation allowances fiscal  fiscal 
the valuation allowances are recorded on our deferred tax assets because we have experienced cumulative operating losses over the past three years 
ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided cash of  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this difference is primarily due to higher inventory levels to support the increased net sales driven by the chambers acquisition and the timing of advance payments for inventory which represented uses of cash of million and million  respectively 
accounts payable was higher due to timing of payments as we continue to improve days of working capital 
reductions in accrued expenses and accounts receivable were achieved through lower salaries and benefits and a reduction in the bad debt reserve as a result of improved collections and fewer customers with financial troubles 
our fiscal and operating activities included million and million in income tax refunds received  respectively 
investing activities related to the chambers transaction consisted of the million estimated present value of an earn out agreement  a noncash financing activity  and million in cash from operating activities paid for the assets listed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report incorporated herein by reference 
purchases of property and equipment in fiscal were primarily related to the move of our corporate offices in december and the consolidation of our distribution facilities into our lower cost dallas  texas distribution facility 
we also recorded property and equipment sale proceeds of  in fiscal primarily from the sale of a warehouse in yoakum  texas  which resulted in a  pretax gain included in other income 
in january  million of assets held in a trust for retired executive officers were fully liquidated and payment of the proceeds to the retirees reduced other current assets and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  million was contributed to the trust 
financing activities included credit facility net borrowings of million in fiscal compared with a  net payment in fiscal the increase over the prior year was primarily due to borrowings related to the chambers transaction and to fund our investing activities 
dividend payments were suspended in december in light of the ongoing decline in economic conditions in order to preserve capital and enhance our financial flexibility for investing in key growth initiatives 
the dividend suspension will be reassessed on an ongoing basis 

table of contents our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our credit facility  which we believe will provide adequate financial resources for our future working capital needs 
we amended our credit facility effective may  to extend its term to october  expand our ability to acquire fixed assets  and to adjust the tangible net worth financial covenant 
information about our us and canadian credit facilities is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
at june   we had million borrowing availability and million in outstanding borrowings under our us facility and million borrowing availability and  in outstanding borrowings under our canadian facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we use estimates throughout our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made or changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are presented below 
revenues and accounts receivable allowances sales are recognized when merchandise is shipped and title to the goods has passed to the customer 
we record allowances  including cash discounts  in store customer allowances  cooperative advertising allowances  and customer returns  as a reduction of sales based upon historical experience  current trends in the retail industry  and individual customer and product experience 
actual returns and allowances may differ from our estimates and differences would affect the operating results of subsequent periods 
sensitivity analysis the following table presents the estimated effect of the indicated increase decrease in our net sales  based on fiscal net sales of million  on our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer allowance dollars in thousands except per share amounts 
changes in general economic conditions  trends and developments within our industry  or situations unique to specific customers could result in significant fluctuations in the actual effects of these estimates 
sales allowances earnings change reserves expense per share change in customer allowances and returns change in allowance for doubtful accounts inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes the direct cost of purchased products and  for manufactured products  materials  direct and indirect labor  and factory overhead 
market  with respect to raw materials  is replacement cost and  with respect to work in process and finished goods  is net realizable value 
in our assessment of the value of inventory  we monitor retailer sell through rates  fashion trends  and the accumulation of excess inventory 
our assessment is both a quantitative measurement eg  the use of metrics such as the number of months supply on hand and qualitative measurement eg  the ability to utilize certain styles in current and future programs 
in general we have relationships with off price store customers that will purchase excess inventory at discounted prices and we have been able to realize values at or above the lower of cost or market values at which we carry our inventories 
if circumstances arise in which the market value of items in inventory declines below cost  an inventory markdown is estimated and charged to expense in the period identified 
if we incorrectly anticipate these trends or if unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 

table of contents sensitivity analysis the effect of a write down in the value of our inventory as of june  would be dollars in thousands except per share amounts percentage earnings of inventory inventory expense per share change in inventory write down uncertain tax positions tax liabilities  together with interest and applicable penalties  are recognized for the benefits of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements which more likely than not may not be realized 
we review the appropriateness of items of revenue or expense excluded or included in our tax returns and the requirements for filing returns with jurisdictions which may have laws requiring us to file tax returns 
failure to recognize a tax liability for the benefits of an uncertain tax position which ultimately is not realized could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
share based compensation the fair values of restricted stock and performance unit grants payable in stock are estimated to be the market price of our common stock on the grant dates and  for performance units  reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends 
the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our stock options are based on historical information and current economic conditions 
estimated fair values increase if the expected dividend yield decreases and the other assumptions increase 
neither the grant date market values of our stock nor the resulting output of the black scholes option pricing model using our assumptions may be the value ultimately realized by our directors and employees or accurately measure the tax benefits we may realize
