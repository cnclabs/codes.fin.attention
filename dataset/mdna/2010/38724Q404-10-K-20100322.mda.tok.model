overview we are a modern american upscale casual restaurant chain 
as of march   we operated restaurants in midwestern states featuring on premises breweries  substantially all of which operate under the name of granite city food brewery 
we believe our menu features high quality yet affordable family favorite menu items prepared from made from scratch recipes and served in generous portions 
we believe that the sophisticated yet unpretentious restaurants  proprietary food and beverage products  attractive price points and high service standards combine for a great dining experience 
our industry can be significantly affected by changes in economic conditions  discretionary spending patterns  consumer tastes  and cost fluctuations 
beginning in  consumers have been under increased economic pressures and as a result  many have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
many consumers are dining out less frequently than in the past and or have decreased the amount they spend on meals while dining out 
to offset the negative impact of decreased sales  we have undertaken a series of initiatives to renegotiate the pricing of various aspects of our business  effectively reducing our cost of food  insurance  payroll processing  shipping  supplies and most recently  our property and equipment rent 
we have also begun implementing marketing initiatives designed to increase brand awareness and help drive guest traffic 
we believe that our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the operating results of our restaurants  changes in food and labor costs  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  nutritional concerns and discretionary spending patterns  competitive factors  the skill and the experience of our restaurant level management teams  the maturity of each restaurant  adverse weather conditions in our markets  our ability to recommence our expansion plans  and the timing of any future restaurant openings and related expenses

wayne  indiana toledo  ohio south bend  indiana indianapolis  indiana total restaurant weeks we provide the statistical measure of restaurant weeks to enhance the comparison of revenue from period to period as changes occur in the number of restaurants we are operating 
our restaurant revenue is comprised almost entirely of the sales of food and beverages 
the sale of retail items typically represents less than one percent of total revenue 
product costs include the costs of food  beverages and retail items 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related costs 
pre opening costs consist of direct costs related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  the salaries and related costs of our dedicated new store opening team  rent expense incurred during the construction period and other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations  which include management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  market research  professional fees  supplies and corporate 
table of contents rent 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures at the restaurant and corporate levels and amortization of intangibles that do not have indefinite lives 
interest expense represents the cost of interest expense on debt and capital leases net of interest income on invested assets

critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of our financial statements property and equipment the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to years 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the initial term of the related lease  which is generally to years 
depreciation is computed on the 
table of contents straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes 
amortization of assets acquired under capital lease is included in depreciation expense 
we review property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired pursuant the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we base this assessment upon the carrying value versus the fair market value of the asset and whether or not that difference is recoverable 
such assessment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis and includes other relevant facts and circumstances including the physical condition of the asset 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
we continually reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates we have made 
leasing activities we have entered into various leases for our buildings  equipment and for ground leases 
at the inception of a lease  we evaluate it to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease pursuant to the fasb guidance on accounting for leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the date the lease agreement is signed and ends on the date the restaurant opens  during which no cash rent payments are typically due 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater pre opening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rent payments based upon restaurants sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease which can impact the classification and account for a lease as capital or operating 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  rent expense and interest expense than would be reported if different assumptions were made 
stock based compensation we have granted stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance the fasb fair value recognition guidance 
stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
under the black scholes option pricing model  we determine the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date 
this requires judgment  including but not limited to judgment concerning the expected volatility and forfeiture of our stock 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is derived from the sale of prepared food and beverage and select retail items and is recognized at the time of sale 
revenue derived from gift card sales is recognized at the time the gift card is redeemed 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  the outstanding balances on such cards are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize gift card breakage amounts based upon historical redemption patterns  which represent the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
such amounts are included as a reduction to our general and administrative expense 
we arrive at this amount using certain management judgments and estimates 
such judgments and estimates may produce different amounts of breakage than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
estimated liability for closing restaurants we continually evaluate the performance of each of our restaurants 
if a restaurant consistently performs poorly  we consider many factors including the demographics of the location and the likelihood of being able to improve the performance of the restaurant 
if we determine that the restaurant will not  within a reasonable period of time  perform to our expectations  we may close the restaurant 
in the event we close a restaurant  we record the liability to cover future lease termination costs using the fair value of these liabilities as estimated in accordance with the fasb guidance on accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this estimate is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee we expect to pay 
the amount of the estimated liability established is generally the present value of these estimated net future payments upon exiting the property 
a significant assumption we use in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing a restaurant is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant restaurants  determined based on the likelihood of successfully negotiating an early termination of the lease agreement with our landlord or subleasing the property 
if it takes longer than anticipated to terminate or sublease the lease  we may need to record additional estimated liability 
if the lease on the vacant restaurant is not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liability  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the lease on the vacant restaurant is terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liability  we would reverse all or some portion of the previously established estimated liability  resulting in an increase in operating income 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december  revenue we generated  and  of revenue during fiscal years and  respectively 
we believe the decrease in revenue of for compared to was caused primarily by the macroeconomic factors affecting the restaurant industry in general 
guest traffic at comparable restaurants  which included restaurants in operation over months  decreased approximately 
throughout and particularly in the last half of the year  we began heavy discounting and a marketing program to drive guest traffic back into the restaurants 
although the discounting further reduced our average check and lowered revenues  our guest traffic has improved in late and early comparable restaurant revenue  which included restaurants in operation over months  decreased from to  primarily due to the additional fiscal week in for each of our comparable restaurants as well as the decrease in guest traffic 
the average weekly revenue per restaurant at our comparable restaurants decreased or  from  in to  in 
table of contents we expect that restaurant revenue will vary from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate continued seasonal fluctuations in restaurant revenue due in part to increased outdoor seating and generally favorable weather conditions at many of our locations during the summer months 
due to the honeymoon effect that periodically occurs with the opening of a restaurant  we expect the timing of any future restaurant openings to cause fluctuations in restaurant revenue 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  timing of holidays  consumer confidence in the economy and changes in consumer preferences may affect our future revenue 
we believe that the decreased consumer confidence that has negatively impacted the restaurant industry as a whole beginning in  continues 
throughout the industry  same store sales and guest traffic counts were lower in than in restaurant costs food and beverage our food and beverage costs  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to in from in pricing negotiations with our suppliers  a menu price increase of approximately in march and improved oversight of inventory and kitchen management contributed to this decrease 
due to the number of restaurants we now operate throughout the midwest  we are able to contract for many of the food commodities we use in our restaurants for periods up to one year 
based on several new contracts entered into in the later part of  we were able to reduce our food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue throughout by reducing our exposure to commodity price increases 
we do  however  expect that our food and beverage costs will continue to vary going forward due to numerous variables  including seasonal changes in food and beverage costs for which we do not have contracted pricing  fluctuation within commodity priced goods and guest preferences 
we periodically create new menu offerings and introduce new craft brewed beers based upon guest preferences 
although such menu modifications may temporarily result in increased food and beverage cost  we believe we are able to offset such increases with our weekly specials which provide variety and value to our guests 
our varieties of craft brewed beer  which we believe we can produce at lower cost than beers we purchase for resale  also enable us to keep our food and beverage costs low while fulfilling guest requests and building customer loyalty 
we expect food and beverage costs at our newer restaurants to be higher initially due to inefficiencies that are part of the start up process of a new restaurant 
additionally  with any future expansion  we believe our brewing process will allow us to keep our high quality beer products intact while leveraging our fixed production costs  thereby enhancing overall profitability 
labor labor expense consists of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items including management bonuses  and non cash stock based compensation expense 
our experience to date has been that staff labor costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
our labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to in from in as our new restaurants began to stabilize and we trained new managers on a number of operational metrics and initiatives focused on manager accountability and internal development of restaurant level staff  we were able to reduce labor costs as a percentage of revenue 
we expect that labor costs will vary as minimum wage laws  local labor laws and practices  and unemployment rates vary from state to state  as will hiring and training expenses 
we believe that retaining good employees and more experienced staff ensures high quality guest service and may reduce hiring and training costs 

table of contents direct restaurant operating operating supplies  repairs and maintenance  utilities  promotions and restaurant level administrative expense represent the majority of our direct restaurant operating expense  a substantial portion of which is fixed or indirectly variable 
our direct restaurant operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in we began to use outside media advertising more aggressively in  which was the primary reason for the increase in direct operating costs 
while such increase as a percentage of revenue was due in part to a smaller revenue base  increases in advertising  linen  laundry and janitorial services  were offset  in part  by the decrease in printing cost and utilities  as well as the reduced cost of certain supplies including paper  plastic and uniforms 
we continue to seek ways to reduce our direct operating costs going forward including additional pricing negotiations and the elimination of waste 
while we started seeing the effects of previously renegotiated operating items in late and benefited more fully from the cost reductions throughout  the cost reductions were more than offset by the decrease in revenue 
occupancy our occupancy costs  which include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property insurance and property taxes  increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in  due in part to a smaller revenue base 
our occupancy cost changed significantly in the fourth quarter of as a result of the lease amendments entered into in october as part of the transaction 
as a result of those amendments  we converted nine of the leases at restaurants we operate from capital to operating leases 
as such  expense related to those leases is included in rent expense instead of interest expense 
also included in our rent expense is the difference between our current rent payments and straight line rent expense over the initial lease term 
this non cash rent expense of  and  is included in occupancy costs in and  respectively 
the  increase in non cash rent expense was due primarily to the rent reductions provided by donald a 
dunham  jr  the affiliated dunham entities collectively  with mr 
dunham  the dunham landlords and certain of our other landlords 
pre opening pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  wages and expenses of a new restaurant opening team during periods of expansion  rental costs incurred during the construction period and certain other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
pre opening costs  excluding construction period rent  are primarily incurred in the month of  and two months prior to  restaurant opening 
pre opening costs decreased  to  in from  in included in such expense in were expenses related to the opening of our restaurant in indianapolis  indiana 
pre opening expenses incurred in were related primarily to the restaurants we opened in st 
louis  missouri  ft 
wayne and south bend  indiana  and toledo  ohio 
general and administrative general and administrative expense includes all salaries and benefits  including non cash stock based compensation  associated with our corporate staff that is responsible for overall restaurant quality  any future expansion into new locations  financial controls and reporting  restaurant management recruiting  management training  excess capacity costs related to our beer production facility  and salaries and expenses of our new restaurant opening team when it was not dedicated to a particular restaurant opening 
other general and administrative expense includes advertising  
table of contents professional fees  investor relations  office administration  centralized accounting system costs and travel by our corporate management 
general and administrative expense decreased  to  in from  in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased in over the primary sources of such decreases were expenses related to recruiting  relocation  training and consulting costs  compensation and travel expense 
such decreases were offset in part by increased marketing and investor relations expense 
non cash stock based compensation included in general and administrative expense was  and  in and  respectively 
we continue to seek ways to reduce our general and administrative expenses through additional pricing negotiations with our vendors 
while we have started seeing the effects of previously renegotiated general and administrative costs  we will closely monitor and attempt to further reduce these expenses while seeking to preserve an infrastructure that remains suitable for our current operations 
although we may need to recruit additional personnel to provide continued oversight of operations  we expect our turnover ratios to return to levels more consistent with the industry  allowing us to reduce our costs 
to the extent our turnover increases above our expectations  additional costs above our budgeted figures could be incurred in our recruiting and training expenses 
we believe our general and administrative expense and our general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue will decrease in compared to depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  to  in from  in  due principally to the additional depreciation related to new restaurants 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation expense increased to in from in  due in part to a smaller revenue base 
exit or disposal activities in august  we closed our rogers  arkansas restaurant 
since opening in october  the restaurant failed to generate positive cash flow and had approximately million of net loss 
we believe the closure of this restaurant has allowed management to focus capital and personnel resources on our other restaurants in order to increase future operating efficiencies and cash flow 
we are working to find a replacement tenant for the location  for which we are bound by a lease 
such lease expires in december  pursuant to an amendment entered into in october costs incurred in and in connection with this closure include costs to maintain the facility of approximately  and  respectively 
we will incur ongoing costs such as utilities  landscape and maintenance and general liability insurance until we are able to find a replacement tenant 
we recorded a non cash lease termination liability of  based on management s estimate of the fair value of these obligations 
this required management to estimate the present value of the future minimum lease obligations offset by the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
in october  we entered into an amendment to the lease for this location 
in conjunction with such amendment  we recorded an additional  non cash lease termination liability to reflect the changes in the lease terms 
amortization of this sublease liability was  in fiscal year all costs related to the closing of the rogers restaurant  including lease payments  are reflected in our statements of operations as exit or disposal activities 
as december   our annual lease payments for the rogers site were  and our ongoing costs to maintain the property were approximately  per month 
as of december   our future undiscounted cash payments under the terms of this lease were approximately million 
as part of the master agreement we entered into with the dunham entities in february  we agreed to reimburse dcm for any out of pocket expenses incurred  reduced by net proceeds from the 
table of contents sale of the real estate or lease income associated with the rogers  arkansas site and the site at troy  michigan upon which we decided not build a restaurant 
we have concluded that as of december   it is probable we will need to reimburse dcm approximately  of such costs related to the troy  michigan site and have included such costs in exit or disposal activities on our statement of operations for fiscal year as of december   the carrying cost of the land approximated  per month 
reimbursement of costs related to these sites  including the carrying cost of the related land  will be amortized and payable to dcm over a month period commencing january  at a annual interest rate 
the actual amount due dcm could fluctuate due to changes in the economy 
interest net interest expense consists of interest expense on capital leases and long term debt  net of interest earned from cash on hand 
interest expense decreased  to  in from  in due to capital lease reductions from our landlords and equipment financers 
additionally  in october  leases at nine of the restaurants we operate were converted from capital to operating leases 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  expense related to such leases that was previously recorded as interest expense  was recorded as occupancy costs 
interest income decreased  in over due to the reduction of cash on hand 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  of cash and a working capital deficit of  compared to  of cash and a  working capital deficit at december  during the year ended december   we obtained  net cash from operating activities and obtained proceeds of  pursuant to capital lease and debt agreements 
we used  of net cash to purchase equipment and other assets primarily related to our new restaurant and our beer production facility  made payments aggregating  on our debt and capital lease obligations and used  cash for costs related to the issuance of common stock to dhw in the transaction 
during the year ended december   we obtained proceeds of  pursuant to capital lease agreements and made payments aggregating  on our debt and capital lease obligations 
we received net cash of  from issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
we used  of net cash in operating activities and  of net cash to purchase equipment and other assets primarily related to our new restaurants and our beer production facility 
reverse stock split in december  our board of directors approved a one for six share combination of our common stock which became effective january  as a result of this reverse stock split  every six shares of our common stock that were issued and outstanding as of january   were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share without any change in the par value of such shares  and the number of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock were proportionally reduced 
a proportionate adjustment was also made to our outstanding stock options and warrants 
no fractional shares were issued in connection with this reverse stock split 
shareholders who were entitled to fractional shares received cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares 
all references within this document to loss per share reflect this reverse stock split 
additionally  the number of common shares  stock options and warrants  and the price per common share  stock option and warrant  reflect this reverse stock split 

table of contents debt conversion transaction in october  we completed the transaction with dhw  our primary source of financing for furniture  fixtures and equipment  as contemplated under the debt conversion agreement between our company and dhw dated september  in the transaction  approximately million of our indebtedness to dhw was converted into  shares of our company s common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share 
we obtained a waiver under the financial viability exception from nasdaq to its shareholder approval requirements  so the transaction was not subject to approval by our shareholders 
the transaction was approved  however  by a special committee of our company s independent directors  by our board of directors  and by our audit committee under our company s related person transaction policy 
as a result  dhw and affiliated parties came to beneficially own an aggregate of of our company s common stock  which constituted a change in control of our company 
because of this change in control  our use of federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be limited 
we recorded approximately million of issuance costs related to the transaction 
during the first year following closing  if the average bid price of our common stock for any period of consecutive trading days equals or exceeds  we will have the right  exercisable on a one time basis  to repurchase for 
per share an amount of the shares issued to dhw in the transaction as would enable dhw to retain such issued shares having a market value of million following such repurchase 
the right may be triggered multiple times during the year  but may only be exercised once 
if we were to exercise this right  such exercise would be considered an equity transaction reported as a reduction of shareholders equity 
in connection with the closing of the transaction  the parties entered into a number of ancillary agreements 
amendment no 
to the master agreement  between the dunham entities and our company amends the master agreement entered into in february by such parties 
under the amendment  the parties agreed to provide the agreed upon rent reductions in and agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to seek rent reductions on real estate leases of up to million in on leases for properties controlled by the dunham landlords and properties not controlled by the dunham landlords  compared to million under the original master agreement 
in connection with the transaction  a master amendment to leases was entered into by and among our company and the dunham landlords 
under the master amendment to leases  the dunham landlords agreed to a limited deferral of of the rent due under lease agreements between our company and the dunham landlords 
in addition  for all rent payments due on or after june  under restaurant leases with the dunham landlords  rent has been deferred for one month 
the deferred rents must be repaid upon the first to occur of a our completing a debt or equity financing in the amount of million or b upon the first anniversary of closing 
the monthly accrued and deferred rent is approximately  per month 
in addition  the dunham landlords waived any defaults or events of default existing under the leases as of the closing date 
in connection with the transaction  our company and three of our executive officers  steven j 
wagenheim  james g 
gilbertson and darius h 
gilanfar  entered into amendments to their existing employment agreements which provide that each will have employment for a term of one year following the closing of the transaction  and will be entitled to severance benefits that include one year of base compensation if employment is terminated without cause  in addition to the balance of the one year term  if terminated prior to the end of such term 
the employment agreements are automatically extended for one year terms unless either our company or the executive gives at least days notice to the other of an intent not to extend 
in addition  mr 
wagenheim s employment agreement was amended to reduce his severance benefit from months to months 

table of contents in connection with the transaction we also entered into an amendment to the bridge loan agreement with harmony which deferred the october  interest payment  modified the minimum net consolidated revenue covenant for the quarters ending september  and december   and waived any participation rights in the transaction 
we also entered into a registration rights agreement with dhw under which we granted dhw certain registration rights with respect to the shares that dhw received in the transaction 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  we agreed to file a registration statement with the sec covering  of dhw s shares within days of the closing date  and agreed  upon request by dhw and if dhw has sold the shares previously registered  to file registration statements covering  additional shares each six months thereafter 
under the registration rights agreement  we are not obligated to file a more than six registration statements  b registration statements more frequently than every six months  or c any registration statement more than three years after the closing date 
the first of such resale registration statements became effective in february harmony bridge loan in march  we entered into a bridge loan agreement with harmony to provide million of partially convertible debt financing 
the chairman of our board of directors  eugene e 
mcgowan  is a member of  and has a beneficial interest in  harmony 
the transaction was approved by our audit committee as a transaction with a related person 
the bridge loan was funded to the extent of  on march   with the balance of the bridge loan originally to be funded by april  the closing date on the remainder of the amount committed was extended by reason of successive amendments through december  an amendment dated december   provided  among other things  that the amount to be loaned under the bridge loan agreement would be decreased to  from million 
the bridge loan is evidenced by notes bearing interest at per annum  payable pursuant to the amendment as follows a the principal amount outstanding under the loans shall be payable as follows i six installments of  each shall be payable on january   and on the first day of each month thereafter including june   ii the remaining principal amount outstanding shall be payable in equal monthly installments commencing on january  and on the first day of each month thereafter  with the final installment of any unpaid principal due on december  b interest accrued shall be treated as follows i accrued and unpaid interest shall be added to the principal amount outstanding under the loans on july   october  and january   ii accrued interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears on april   july   october  and january   and iii accrued interest shall be payable monthly in arrears commencing on february  and on the first day of each month thereafter  with a final payment of any accrued and unpaid interest due on december  with the final payment of principal 
the notes are secured by a mortgage against the lease  and security agreements against personal property and intangibles  relating to the our sioux falls  south dakota restaurant  including a grant of the rights to use patents  trademarks and other intangibles associated with that restaurant 
the notes may be prepaid upon days prior notice without premium or penalty 
the notes must also be paid if we receive million or more of proceeds from the sale of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities 
the notes must also be repaid in the event we default under the terms and conditions of the bridge loan  including the financial covenants set forth therein 
such covenants include maintaining minimum operating income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from the sioux falls  south dakota restaurant operations  and minimum consolidated revenue of our 
table of contents company  as provided in the bridge loan agreement 
up to of each bridge note may be converted into common stock at a conversion price equal to per share 
in addition  we issued to harmony warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares of common stock exercisable six months after date of issuance at a price of per share  or of the closing price of our stock on march  the notes and the warrants provide customary anti dilution rights to the holders  including weighted average anti dilution provisions for sales at less than the exercise or conversion prices thereof 
we have also agreed that if we propose to issue new securities in excess of of our outstanding shares prior to may   subject to the exceptions noted below  we will give the investors the right to purchase up to that portion of the new securities which equals the proportion of the number of securities purchasable upon conversion of notes and exercise of the warrants relative to our outstanding stock as of march  the participation right is not applicable to certain categories of issuances  such as shares issuable pursuant to public offerings  mergers and acquisitions  and options  warrants and other rights to purchase securities 
we have also granted the investors certain rights to require us to file a registration statement with the sec covering the common stock acquired by them upon conversion of the notes or exercise of the warrants  or include such shares in certain company registrations  at our expense 
rent reduction agreements in february  we entered into a master agreement with the dunham entities to provide rent or other cash flow reductions to us in the amount of million for the calendar year and million for calendar year the master agreement provided that the dcm would amend and restate applicable leases and subleases to reflect negotiated rent reductions 
as a part of the master agreement  dcm agreed to amend its leases with us that were treated as capital leases for accounting purposes by reducing their terms to periods which would thereafter qualify the leases to be treated as operating leases in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as part of the transaction entered into in october  the dunham entities agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to seek rent reductions on real estate leases of up to million in rather than the above referenced million and the dunham landlords amended their building leases 
the amended terms were effective january   and in most cases the expiration date of the lease is december  we have determined that ten of the amended leases including rogers  arkansas qualify as operating leases and seven will remain capital leases 
as a result of these amendments  we removed approximately million of assets and million of liabilities from our balance sheet 
the resulting gain will be recognized over the life of the amended leases 
in consideration of the agreements of dcm provided in the master agreement  we issued to the dunham entities a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  representing of the closing price of our common stock on the trading date prior to the date of signing the master agreement 
the value of these warrants of  is being amortized over a ten year period  which is the term of the majority of the underlying lease agreements 
subsequently  we entered into agreements with certain of our other landlords for rent reductions 
such rent reductions are deemed to be part of the above referenced million in aggregate rent reductions sought for and in consideration of such rent reductions  we have issued five year warrants to purchase our common stock to such landlords 
at the time of issuance  the aggregate number of shares underlying such warrants was  and the weighted average exercise price was per share 
the value of these warrants of  is being amortized over the underlying lease terms 
we believe the transaction has improved our balance sheet by reducing aggregate indebtedness and better positioning our company to operate our business 
our ability to fund our operations in future periods will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  achieving budgeted revenue and operating margins  and on the availability of equity and debt financing  all of 
table of contents which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the retail and casual dining industries and other factors  which may be beyond our control 
the amount of any such required funding would depend upon our ability to generate working capital 
if our future operating performance is below expectations and management determines we need to raise capital  there can be no assurance that we will obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance and sale of equity securities  the securities may be issued at prices below the market price of our stock  and our shareholders may suffer significant dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations  covenants and financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate and grow our business  and would cause us to incur additional interest expense and financing costs 
if cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund expected capital needs  or if our needs are greater than anticipated and we are unable to obtain additional capital  our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected

in addition to such property leases  we have obligations under the following operating leases we operate nine restaurants under operating lease agreements with the dunham landlords

development agreement in april  we entered into a development agreement with united properties for the development of up to restaurants to be built between and united properties will be responsible for all costs related to the land and building of each restaurant 
the development agreement provides for a cooperative process between united properties and our management for the selection of restaurant sites and the development of restaurants on those sites and scheduling for the development and construction of each restaurant once a location is approved 
the annual lease rate for fee simple land and building developments will be and we will have the right of first offer to purchase these restaurants

we assume no liability in the event united properties sells a building at a loss 
we are not bound to authorize the construction of restaurants during that time period  but generally cannot use another developer to develop or own a restaurant as long as the development agreement is in effect

off balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations under contractual agreements and the timeframe within which payments on such obligations are due 
this table does not include amounts related to contingent rent as such future amounts are not determinable 
in addition  whether we would incur any additional expense on our employment agreements depends upon the existence of a change in control 
table of contents of the company coupled with a termination of employment or other unforeseeable events 
therefore  neither contingent rent nor severance expense has been included in the following table 
payment due by period contractual obligations total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years fiscal years thereafter long term debt  principal interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease obligations  including interest purchase contracts loan guarantee total obligations while we are contractually obligated to make these purchases  we have the contractual right to defer such purchases into later years 
however  if we defer such purchases into later years  we may incur additional charges 
certain amounts do not sum due to rounding 
during  we did not meet our internal budget primarily due to declining revenue 
we believe the transaction completed in october has improved our balance sheet by reducing aggregate indebtedness and better positions our company to operate our business 
we continue to review our capital needs and our ability to raise additional capital 
based on our current operating trends  we believe we have sufficient capital to operate our business during if  however  we experience a change in our business operations or further declining revenues  we may require further funding for operations during recently issued accounting standards see the recently issued accounting standards section of note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of new accounting literature 
seasonality we expect that our sales and earnings will fluctuate based on seasonal patterns 
we anticipate that our highest sales and earnings will occur in the second and third quarters due to the milder climate and availability of outdoor seating during those quarters in our markets 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  supplies and labor costs 
a large percentage of our restaurant personnel is paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
in the past  we have been able to minimize the effect of these increases through menu price increases and other strategies 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
changes in interest rate pursuant to the terms of our long term debt agreement with an independent financial institution  we will have a balloon payment due of approximately million in if it becomes necessary to refinance such balloon balance  we may not be able to secure financing at the same interest rate 
the effect of a higher interest rate would depend upon the negotiated financing terms 
changes in commodity prices many of the food products and other commodities we use in our operations are subject to price volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
fluctuations in commodity prices and or long term changes could have an adverse effect on us 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
to manage this risk in part  we have entered into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
we have entered into contracts through with certain suppliers of raw materials primarily hops for minimum purchases both in terms of quantity and pricing 
as of december   our future obligations under such contracts aggregated approximately million 
although a large national distributor is our primary supplier of food  substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control commodity price risks 
additionally  we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  in response to food product price increases 
if  however  competitive circumstances limit our menu price flexibility  our margins could be negatively impacted 
our company does not enter into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes
