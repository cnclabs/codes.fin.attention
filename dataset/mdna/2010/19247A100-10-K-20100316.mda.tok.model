critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we believe the estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a thorough understanding of our accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
management considers the following accounting policies critical to an informed review of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of these and additional accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investments management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re evaluates such determination at each statement of financial condition date 
securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as trading securities and are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices  market prices obtained from independent pricing services engaged by management or as determined by our fair value committee  with unrealized gains and losses reported as gain loss from trading securities reported in our consolidated statement of operations 
trading securities are attributable to the consolidation of our investment in the onshore global real estate long short fund 
investments classified as an equity investment represent our equity interest in our offshore global real estate long short fund using the equity method of accounting  under which the investor recognizes its respective share of the investee s net income for the period 
investments classified as available for sale are primarily comprised of investment grade preferred instruments and investments in our sponsored open end and closed end mutual funds 
these investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or market prices obtained from independent pricing services engaged by management  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we periodically review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss  or impairment  to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 
if we believe an impairment of a security position is other than temporary  the loss will be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of an acquired company over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value to their carrying amounts 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments granted to employees 
this expense is recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service 
we also estimate forfeitures 
during the year ended december   we reduced our estimated forfeiture rate  resulting in an increase in employee compensation and benefits of approximately million 
income taxes we record the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable income in future years 
we record a valuation allowance  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance as an amendment to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the new guidance adds requirements for disclosure about transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
the guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques in level and level fair value measurements 
this new guidance is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year 
the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued the accounting standards codification the codification and a new hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the new guidance became the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities

in june  the fasb issued new guidance related to consolidation of variable interest entities vies which required careful reconsideration of previous conclusions  including whether an entity is a vie  whether the enterprise is the vie s primary beneficiary  and what type of financial statement disclosures are required 
this guidance is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year 
in february  the fasb issued new guidance as an amendment to consolidation of vies 
the amendment deferred the consolidation requirements for a reporting entity s interest in an entity that has all the attributes of an investment company  or for which it is industry practice to apply measurement principles for financial reporting purposes that are consistent with those followed by investment companies 
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we meet the criteria under the deferral afforded by the amendment 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance related to subsequent events 
this guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this new guidance was effective for the second quarter of our fiscal year 
in february  the fasb issued new guidance as an amendment to disclosure requirements for subsequent events 
the amendment removes the requirement for an sec filer to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in an entity s financial statements 
the new guidance was effective for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new guidance which required disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements 
provided guidance to determine when the volume and level of transaction activity for assets or liabilities have significantly decreased and identify transactions that are not representative of an orderly market where quoted prices may not be determinative of fair value 
amended guidance with respect to the other than temporary impairment evaluation model for debt securities 
the above new guidance was effective for the second quarter of our fiscal year 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance to clarify the application of fair value measurements in an inactive market and provided an illustrative example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the guidance provided is consistent with our approach to valuing financial assets for which there are no active markets 
in march  the fasb amended previous guidance enhancing disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this guidance was effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year 
the adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb amended previous guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and for the deconsolidation of subsidiaries 
the amended guidance was effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year 
the adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to the risk from changes in interest and currency rates and securities market and general economic fluctuations  which may have an adverse impact on the value of our investments and securities owned 
at december   we had approximately million of securities owned and approximately million of securities sold but not yet purchased  which were comprised primarily of domestic equities 
at december   we had approximately million of an equity investment  which represented our equity interest in our offshore global real estate long short fund 
as of december   we had approximately million of investments  available for sale which were comprised of approximately million invested in our sponsored mutual funds  million invested in perpetual preferred securities  million invested in foreign and domestic common stocks and million invested in fixed income instruments 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment loss of approximately million from investments  available for sale  primarily from preferred securities and seed money investments in our sponsored mutual funds  million of which related to securities that were sold during the year ended december  a significant majority of our revenue approximately  and in the years ended december   and  respectively is derived from investment advisory agreements with our clients 
under these agreements  the investment advisory and administration fee we receive is based on the market value of the assets we manage 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally  and real estate securities in particular  attributable to such market factors as inflation  interest changes and economic downturn  may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease  which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees  or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk  which would also result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 
in addition  market conditions currently preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in closed end mutual funds 
the market conditions for these offerings may continue to be unfavorable in the future  which will adversely impact our ability to grow the assets we manage and realize higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
further  depending on market conditions  the closed end funds we manage may increase or decrease their leverage in order to maintain the funds target leverage ratios  thereby increasing or decreasing the assets we manage 
as of december   and of the assets we managed were concentrated in us real estate common stocks and global real estate common stocks  respectively 
an increase in interest rates or prolonged economic downturn could have a negative impact on the valuation of reits and other securities in our clients portfolios  which could reduce our revenue 
in addition  an increase in interest rates or prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact our ability to increase open end mutual fund assets and to offer new mutual funds
