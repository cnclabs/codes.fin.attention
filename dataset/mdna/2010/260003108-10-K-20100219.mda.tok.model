gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the company  including information regarding contingencies  risk and its financial condition 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
the company believes that its significant accounting policies are primary areas where the financial information of the company is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgement which include the following areas revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d delivery has occurred 
in revenue transactions where installation is required  revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue transactions involving non essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers 
if the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product  then revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete 
in addition  when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement  the company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified 
in a limited number of revenue transactions  other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and  accordingly  revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay  or acceptance has been confirmed 
service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed 
revenues associated with construction type contracts are recorded using the percentage of completion method 
the company recognizes contract revenue under percentage of completion accounting using the cost to cost method measure of progress

other domestic inventory is stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
the electronic technologies companies tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 
occasionally  the company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation  in accordance with appropriate accounting principles 
these reserves  for both severance and exit costs  require the use of estimates 
though the company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 
the company has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
the company s assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate  during the interim periods 
the company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations 
the valuation of the company s pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for the company s future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on the company s pension expenses and related funding requirements 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns  economic trends and portfolio allocation 
the company s discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams 
the plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year by year spot rates 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated  using a more likely than not criteria  for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations  changes in tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates  and the company s future taxable income levels 
the provisions for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes 
the company has significant accruals and reserves related to the self insured portion of its risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  the company s experience and relevant industry data 
the company reviews these factors quarterly and considers the 
table of contents current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and company experience 
the company has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify the company s ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to ensure that the company is properly reserved
