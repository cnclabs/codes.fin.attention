b financial information about business segments we manage our business in four segments north american dispute and investigative services  north american business consulting services  international consulting operations  and economic consulting services 
the economic consulting services segment was added in in connection with our acquisition of the chicago partners business on may  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions 
these segments are generally defined by the nature of their services and by geography 
the business is managed and resources are allocated on the basis of the four operating segments 

table of contents the north american dispute and investigative services segment provides a wide range of services to clients facing the challenges of disputes  litigation  forensic investigation  discovery  and regulatory compliance 
the clients of this segment are principally law firms  corporate general counsel and corporate boards

the relative percentages of revenues attributable to each segment were as follows for the year ended december  north american dispute and investigative services north american business consulting services international consulting operations economic consulting services the relative percentages of segment operating profit attributable to each segment were as follows for the year ended december  north american dispute and investigative services north american business consulting services international consulting operations economic consulting services segment operating profit as a percentage of segment revenue before reimbursement was as follows for the year ended december  north american dispute and investigative services north american business consulting services international consulting operations economic consulting services total segment operating profit 
table of contents total assets by segment were as follows in thousands december  north american dispute and investigative services north american business consulting services international consulting operations economic consulting services unallocated assets total assets the information presented above does not necessarily reflect the results of segment operations that would have occurred had the segments been stand alone businesses 
certain unallocated expense amounts  related to specific reporting segments  have been excluded from the segment operating profit to be consistent with the information used by management to evaluate segment performance 
c narrative description of business overview we market our services directly to corporate counsel  law firms  government entities  corporate boards  corporate executives and special committees 
we use a variety of business development and marketing channels to communicate directly with current and prospective clients  including on site presentations  industry seminars  and industry specific articles 
new engagements are sought and won by our senior and mid level consultants working together with our business development team that supports all segments 
our future performance will continue to depend upon the ability of our consultants to win new engagements as well as our ability to retain such consultants 
a significant portion of new business arises from prior client engagements 
in addition  we seek to leverage our client relationships in one business segment to cross sell existing services provided by the other segments 
clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow on  complementary activities 
in addition  an on site presence affords our consultants the opportunity to become aware of  and to help define  additional project opportunities as they are identified 
we derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
such incremental revenues may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
our most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses  and the direct costs of recruiting and training the consulting staff 
consultant compensation consists of salaries  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes payroll costs  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel  which are used to indirectly support client projects 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
other administrative costs include marketing  technology  finance and human capital management 

table of contents service offerings we provide wide and varied service offerings to our broad client base 
we consider the following to be our key professional services dispute  investigative  financial  operational and business advisory services  risk management and regulatory advisory services  strategy  economic analysis and transaction advisory solutions 
industry sectors we provide services to and focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change 
our service offerings are relevant to most industries and to the public sector 
however  we have significant industry specific knowledge and a large client base in the disputes  economics  construction  energy  financial services and healthcare industries 
human capital as of december   we had  employees  which represented  full time equivalent fte employees  which are total employees adjusted for part time status 
such fte employees were comprised of  consultants  project employees and administrative employees 
revenues are primarily generated from services performed by our consultants  therefore  success depends in large part on attracting  retaining and motivating talented  creative and experienced professionals at all levels 
in connection with recruiting  we employ internal recruiters  retain executive search firms  and utilize personal and business contacts to recruit professionals with significant subject matter expertise and or consulting experience 
consultants are drawn from the industries we serve  from accounting and other consulting organizations  and from top rated colleges and universities 
we try to retain our consultants by offering competitive packages of base and incentive compensation  equity ownership  benefits and challenging careers 
independent contractors supplement our consultants on certain engagements 
we find that hiring independent contractors on a per engagement basis from time to time allows us to adjust staffing in response to changes in demand for our services 
in addition to the employees and independent contractors discussed above  we have acquired and seek to acquire consulting businesses to add highly skilled professionals  to enhance our service offerings and to expand our geographical footprint 
we believe that the strategy of selectively acquiring consulting businesses and consulting capabilities strengthens our platform  market share and overall operating results 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond the termination of employment 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects 
we continually review and adjust  if needed  our consultants total compensation to include salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  and other cash and equity incentives to ensure that it is competitive within the industry  consistent with our performance  and provides us with the ability to achieve target profitability levels 
our compensation structure is reviewed and approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
our bill rates to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience and levels of the consulting staff 
we monitor and adjust those bill rates according to the supply and demand of the then current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve 
competition the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national  and international consulting firms 
many of these companies are global in scope and have larger teams of personnel  financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
however  we believe that our independence  experience  reputation  industry focus  and broad range of professional services enable us to compete effectively in the consulting marketplace

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
such factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the marketplace caused by economic and political conditions 
global economic and political conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve 
a severe and or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activity engaged in by our clients and the industries we serve 
clients could determine that discretionary projects are no longer viable or that new projects are not advisable 
this may reduce demand for our services  depress pricing for our services or render certain services obsolete  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in global economic conditions or the regulatory or legislative landscape could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages  and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 
although we have implemented cost management measures  if we are unable to appropriately manage costs or if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes  and our business could be negatively affected 
additionally  significant economic turmoil or financial market disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us 
such events could also adversely impact the availability of financing to our clients and therefore adversely impact our ability to collect amounts due from such clients or cause them to terminate their contracts with us 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to consummate future acquisitions or to meet required working capital needs or repay amounts owed under our long term credit arrangements 
we maintain a million unsecured credit facility including a term loan agreement and a revolving line of credit agreement to assist in funding short term and long term cash requirements 
this agreement which expires in contains certain covenants requiring  among other things  certain levels of interest and debt coverage 
poor performance could cause us to be in default of these covenants 
while we were in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement as of december   there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance in the future 
in addition  the current credit facility may not be sufficient to meet the future needs of our business if a decline in financial performance occurs  nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to affect future acquisitions or to otherwise meet our working capital needs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our current credit facility as it comes due or refinance our current credit facility at comparable terms 
furthermore  financial institutions that are lenders under our credit facility may be adversely impacted by the economy and unable to meet their obligations under our credit facility 
furthermore  if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  our financial position and our financial results would be adversely impacted  which could result in all of the effects described above 
our business could be impacted by competition and regulatory and legislative changes 
the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national  and international consulting firms 
many of these companies are global in scope and have larger teams of personnel  financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
some may have lower overhead and other costs and can compete through lower cost service offerings 
there is a risk that 
table of contents downward pressure on pricing may impact our profitability 
many of our clients are in highly regulated industries such as healthcare  energy  financial services and insurance 
regulatory and legislative changes in these industries could impact the market for our service offerings  including potentially rendering certain of our service offerings obsolete 
in addition  regulatory and legislative changes could impact the competition for consulting services 
these changes could either increase or decrease our competitive position 
our business has low barriers to entry making it easy for professionals to start their own business or work independently 
in addition  it is relatively easy for professionals to change employers 
if we cannot compete effectively with or if the costs of competing  including the cost of retaining and hiring professionals becomes too expensive our revenue growth and profitability could be negatively impacted 
our inability to hire and retain appropriate level of skilled professionals could have an adverse effect on the success of our business 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to hire  retain  develop and motivate highly skilled professionals 
competition for these skilled professionals is intense and our inability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of consultants  senior practitioners and executives could have a serious effect on our ability to meet client needs and to successfully run our business 
the loss of a significant number of our employees could have a serious negative effect 
in particular  we rely heavily on a group of senior executives and senior practitioners and retaining their services is important to our future success 
if individuals leave and we cannot quickly find suitable candidates to replace these individuals or we cannot quickly hire individuals to support our growth it could impact our ability to manage our business 
further  usage restrictions on our equity and any significant volatility or sustained decline in the market price of our common stock could impair our ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate professionals 
compensation and retention related issues are a continuing challenge 
any failures in this regard could impact  among other factors  our revenues  growth and profitability 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain current pricing and utilization rates 
our revenue  and thereby our profitability  is largely based on the bill rates charged to clients and the number of hours our professionals work on client engagements  which we define as the utilization of our professionals 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals  revenues  project profit margins and our profitability will suffer 
bill rates and utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to predict future demand for services and maintain the appropriate staffing without significant underutilized personnel  our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new engagements  our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  our competitors pricing of services  the market demand for our services  our ability to manage our human capital resources and overhead costs  including real estate obligations  our ability to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our growth strategies  and the economic  political and regulatory environment as noted above 
our client engagements are generally short term in nature  less than one year  and may be terminated 
our inability to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on us 
our client engagements and revenues are frequently event driven and therefore difficult to forecast 
we might not meet our current or future commitments if we do not continually secure new engagements 

table of contents many of the client engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation is settled  our engagement for those services usually is no longer necessary and is promptly terminated 
some of our work involves multiple engagements or stages 
in those engagements  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
our engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to our office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
in the past  we have derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the california energy crisis  the sarbanes oxley act of  the subprime mortgage crisis and significant natural disasters including major hurricanes and earthquakes 
those events  in addition to being unpredictable  often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for the challenges they face 
these factors limit our ability to predict future revenues and professional staffing levels  which can impact our financial results 
unsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to our professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our professional reputation and that of our consultants is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals 
any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our engagements are subject to the risk of legal liability 
any public assertion or litigation alleging that our services were deficient or that we breached any of our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities  could distract our management and could damage our reputation 
we carry professional liability insurance  but our insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from our engagements 
in addition  the limits of our insurance coverage may not be enough to cover a particular claim or a group of claims  and the costs of defense 
some of the work that we do involves greater risk than ordinary consulting engagements 
we do work for clients that for financial  legal or other reasons may present higher than normal risks 
while we attempt to identify and mitigate our exposure with respect to higher risk engagements and higher risk clients  these efforts may be ineffective and a professional error or omission in one or more of these higher risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
examples of higher risk engagements include  but are not limited to interim management engagements  usually in hospitals and other healthcare providers  corporate restructuring engagements  both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings  engagements where we deliver a fairness opinion  engagements where we deliver project management services for large construction projects  engagements where we deliver a compliance effectiveness opinion  and engagements involving independent consultants reports in support of financings 
as we become larger  we increasingly encounter professional conflicts of interest 
as we become larger  the potential for conflicts of interest also increases 
if we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason  including a conflict of interest  our consultants may become underutilized or discontented  which may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations  as well as our ability to retain these consultants 
in addition  although we have systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts prior to accepting each new engagement  those systems are not fool proof and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and professional liability which may adversely impact our financial results 

table of contents our international operations create special risks 
we have physical offices in the united kingdom  canada and china and conduct business in several other countries 
we expect to continue to expand globally and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial  business and legal risks  including cultural and language differences  employment laws and related factors that could result in lower utilization  higher staffing costs  and cyclical fluctuations of utilization and revenues  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  burdensome regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business  managing the risks associated with engagements with foreign officials and governmental agencies  including the risks arising from the foreign corrupt practices act  greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  successful entry and execution in new markets  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and potentially adverse tax consequences  such as trapped foreign losses 
if we are not able to quickly adapt to our new markets  our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our work with governmental clients has inherent risks related to the governmental contracting process 
we work for various united states and foreign governmental entities and agencies 
these projects have risks that include  but are not limited to  the following government entities reserve the right to audit our contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts 
if the government finds that the costs are not reimbursable  then we will not be allowed to bill for them  or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to us 
findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work and affect future margins 
if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government 
the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities  regardless of the adequacy of such controls 
government contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our government contracts  regardless of whether it is accurate  may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our relationship with the particular government agency involved  but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

table of contents we have invested in specialized systems  processes and intellectual capital for which we may fail to recover our investment or which may become obsolete 
we have developed specialized systems and processes that provide a competitive advantage in serving current clients and obtaining new clients 
additionally  many of our service offerings rely on technology or intellectual capital that is subject to rapid change 
our intellectual capital  in certain service offerings  may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 
our information technology systems will require improvements as our business grows 
the increased scale and complexity of our businesses may require additional information management systems that we may not be able to implement in a cost effective and timely manner 
the challenges of achieving and managing sustained growth may cause strain on our management team  management processes and information technology systems 
if we are unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  this may impair our financial results  competitive position and ability to retain our professionals 
we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls 
if we fail to achieve and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting or fail to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use  we may fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis  or be unable to adequately report on our business and the results of operations 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
nevertheless  even with adequate controls  we may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud 
also  controls that are currently adequate may in the future become inadequate because of changes in conditions 
the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 
acquired businesses may not achieve expected results which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have developed our business  in part  through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
the substantial majority of the purchase price we pay for acquired businesses is related to goodwill and intangible assets 
we may not be able to realize the value of those assets or otherwise realize anticipated synergies unless we are able to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire 
we face multiple challenges in integrating acquired businesses and their personnel  including differences in corporate cultures and management styles  retention of personnel  conflict issues with clients  and the need to divert managerial resources that would otherwise be dedicated to our current businesses 
any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could cause the acquired businesses to fail to achieve expected results  which would in turn  adversely affect our financial performance  including possible impairment of the acquired assets 
additionally  the financing of acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could also impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because we have historically acquired a significant number of companies  goodwill and other intangible assets have represented a material portion of our assets 
we are required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
we also are required to review long lived assets  including identified intangible assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of one of our businesses  and other factors 
if the fair market value of one of our businesses is less than its carrying amount  we could be required to record an impairment charge 
the valuation of the businesses requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of our businesses  including such factors as market performance  changes in 
table of contents our client base and operating cash flows 
the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
we are subject to unpredictable risks of litigation 
although we seek to avoid litigation whenever possible  from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
disputes may arise  for example  from client engagements  employment issues  regulatory actions  corporate acquisitions  real estate and other business transactions 
the costs and outcome of those lawsuits or claims cannot be predicted with certainty  and may be worse than we can foresee 
this could have a material adverse effect on us

unresolved staff comments 
none 
item properties 
we have approximately operating leases for office facilities  principally in the united states 
due to acquisitions and growth  we often times have more than one operating lease in the cities in which we have offices 
our office space needs in certain geographic areas may change as our business expands or contracts in those areas 
we believe we will be able to adjust our property holdings as needed but we may incur office consolidation expenses associated with reductions in our office space 
following are our principal regional office locations united states outside of the united states atlanta  georgia china hong kong chicago  illinois canada toronto los angeles  california united kingdom london new york  new york san francisco  california washington dc item legal proceedings 
from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of those lawsuits or claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of those lawsuits or claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

we provide our services to government agencies  legal counsel and large companies facing the challenges of uncertainty  risk  distress and significant change 
we focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change and on the issues driving these transformations 
our revenues  margins and profits have been and will likely continue to be impacted by a significant decline in the united states and world economy 
examples of other impacting events that may affect us both favorably and unfavorably are natural disasters  legislative and regulatory changes  capital market disruptions  reductions in discretionary consulting spending  crises in the energy  healthcare  financial services  insurance and other industries  and significant client specific events 
we derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
such incremental revenues may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
our most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses  and the direct costs of recruiting and training the consulting staff 
consultant compensation consists of salaries  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes payroll costs  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel  which are used to indirectly support client projects 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
other administrative costs include marketing  technology  finance and human capital management 
human capital resources our human capital resources include consulting professionals and administrative and management personnel 
as a result of both recruiting activities and business acquisitions  we have a diverse pool of consultants and administrative support staff with various skills and experience 
the average number of fte consultants is adjusted for part time status and takes into consideration hiring and attrition which occurred during the period 
in addition to our consultants and administrative personnel  we hire project employees on a short term basis or seasonal basis 
we believe the practice of hiring these employees provides greater flexibility in adjusting consulting and administrative personnel levels in response to changes in demand for our professional services 
the short term or seasonal hires supplement services on certain engagements or provide additional administrative support to our consultants 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend 
table of contents months beyond termination of employment 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects

at december   we had total bank debt outstanding of million under our credit agreement compared to million at december  in january  we used a portion of our cash to prepay million of our term loan facility under our credit facility which will reduce future required quarterly payments on a pro rata basis 
we calculate accounts receivable days sales outstanding or dso by dividing the accounts receivable balance  net of reserves and deferred revenue credits  at the end of the quarter  by daily net revenues 
daily net revenues are calculated by taking quarterly net revenues divided by days  approximately equal to the number of days in a quarter 
calculated as such  we had dso of days at december  compared to days at december  the increase in dso was attributable to slower client payments associated with specific client situations and overall economic conditions 
operating activities for  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to resulted primarily from lower net income partially offset by a decrease in investments in working capital 
the decreased investment in working capital year over year was primarily related to incentive loans issued during the second and third quarters of see discussion of unsecured forgivable loans in note supplemental balance sheet information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities during compared to decreased slightly due to a higher investment in working capital  partially offset by increased net income 
the increase in working capital was mainly associated with separation and severance payments and incentive loans made in  which was partially offset by increased accounts receivable collections during investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
during we paid million for the cash portion of the purchase price for chicago partners payable at closing compared to acquisitions totaling million during in we spent million in capital infrastructure  primarily related to leasehold improvements at a new office located in new york and software license agreements  compared to million in the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for compared to mainly relates to a decrease in acquisitions and lower investment in technology and leasehold improvements 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in and provided by financing activities of million in cash used in financing activities increased in mainly due to less proceeds from issuances of common stock primarily associated with reduced employee stock purchases 
during  we had net repayments of bank borrowings of million associated primarily with lower cash needs for investing activities 
during  we had net cash proceeds from bank borrowings of million which were used primarily to fund a million purchase of shares of our stock 
in june  we completed our modified dutch auction tender offer and purchased million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
we also recorded management and agent fees related to the tender offer as part of the costs of the purchase of our common stock 

table of contents debt  commitments and capital as of december   we maintained a bank borrowing credit agreement consisting of a million revolving line of credit which  subject to certain bank approvals  includes an option to increase to million and a million unsecured term loan facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are payable in may our credit agreement provides for borrowings in multiple currencies including us dollars  canadian dollars  uk pound sterling and euro 
as of december   we had aggregate borrowings of million  compared to million as of december  at december   all of our borrowings were under the term loan facility of our credit agreement 
based on our financial covenant restrictions under our credit facility as of december   a maximum of approximately million would be available in additional borrowings on our line of credit 
in january  we used a portion of our cash to prepay million of our term loan facility under our credit facility which will reduce future required quarterly payments on a pro rata basis 
if this prepayment had happened on december  our availability to borrow on our line of credit would have been approximately million 
at our option  borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility bear interest  in general  based on a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
for libor loans  the applicable margin will vary depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of total funded debt to adjusted ebitda and whether the loan is made under the term loan facility or revolving credit facility 
as of december   the applicable margins on libor loans under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were and  respectively 
as of december   the applicable margins for base rate loans under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were and zero  respectively 
for libor loans  the applicable margin will vary between to depending upon our performance and financial condition 
our average borrowing rate under our credit agreement including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  see note comprehensive income in the notes to the consolidated financial statements was and for and  respectively 
our credit agreement also includes certain financial covenants  including covenants that require that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of the sum of adjusted ebitda and rental expense to the sum of cash interest expense and rental expense of not less than at december   under the definitions in the credit agreement  our consolidated leverage ratio was and our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was in addition to the financial covenants  our credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and is subject to customary exceptions 
these covenants limit our ability to incur liens or other encumbrances or make investments  incur indebtedness  enter into mergers  consolidations and asset sales  pay dividends or other distributions  change the nature of our business and engage in transactions with affiliates 
we were in compliance with the terms of our credit agreement as of december  and  however there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance in the future 
as of december   we had total commitments of million  which were comprised of million in deferred business acquisition obligations  payable in cash and common stock  software license agreements of million  debt of million  and million in lease commitments 
as of december   we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
the following table shows the components of significant commitments as of december  and the scheduled years of payments due by period shown in thousands contractual obligations total to to thereafter deferred purchase price obligations software license agreements term loan lease commitments 
table of contents during  we began to eliminate duplicate facilities  consolidate and close certain offices 
of the million of lease commitments as of december   million of the lease commitments related to offices we have abandoned or reduced excess space within  which have been subleased or are available for sublease 
as of december   we have contractual subleases of million  which is not reflected in the commitment table above 
such sublease income would offset the cash outlays 
additionally  we intend to secure subtenants for the properties available for sublease to offset the rent payments and will seek to exercise termination clauses  if any  to shorten the term of the lease commitments 
such sublease income  if any  would offset the cash outlays 
the lease commitments for these offices extend through as of january   we adopted new guidance on uncertain tax positions 
we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits which  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
during  and  we reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to such unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million  million and million  respectively  due to the settlement of tax positions with various tax authorities or by virtue of the statute of limitations expiring for the years with uncertain positions 
as such  we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits which  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
we do not expect to significantly increase or reduce our reserve for uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  the future cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide adequate cash to fund anticipated short term and long term cash needs from normal operations 
in the event we make significant cash expenditures in the future for major acquisitions or other non operating activities  we might need additional debt or equity financing  as appropriate 
additionally  our credit agreement is with a syndicate of several banks 
these banks could be negatively impacted by the recent disruptions in the financial markets 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues as the related professional services are provided 
in connection with recording revenues  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenues to cash 
we may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement and are required to assess whether one or more units of accounting are present 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services 
the recording of these fixed revenue amounts requires us to make an estimate of the total amount of work to be performed and revenues are then recognized as efforts are expended based on i objectively determinable output measures  ii input measures if output measures are not reliable or iii the straight line method over the term of the arrangement 
from time to time  we also earn incremental revenues 
these incremental revenue amounts are generally contingent on a specific event and the incremental revenues are recognized when the contingencies are resolved 
any taxes assessed on revenues relating to services provided to our clients are recorded on a net basis 
accounts receivable realization we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our clients ability to make required payments  and the estimated realization  in cash  by us of 
table of contents amounts due from our clients 
if our clients financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair value of the net assets acquired  which is accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles other than goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill include customer lists and relationships  employee non compete agreements  employee training methodology and materials  backlog revenue and trade names 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized based on the period of consumption  ranging up to nine years 
our long term assets are subject to changes in events or circumstances that could impact their carrying value 
we test goodwill annually for impairment 
we also review long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our impairment testing and reviews may be impacted by  among other things  our expected operating performance  market valuation of comparable companies  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
a decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units or other long term assets could result in impairment charges 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization during the periods presented 
we do not amortize goodwill 
goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment test is performed using a two step  fair value based test 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value determined in step one 
the impairment test is considered for each reporting unit as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets which are the same as our reporting segments 
our test for goodwill impairment is based on the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is subject to  among other things  changes in our estimated business future growth rate  profit margin  long term outlook and weighted average cost of capital 
our international consulting operations and economic consulting services reporting units are most sensitive to those changes as the excess of their fair values over their asset carrying values is generally lower 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
the achievement of such internal projections and operating plans will be impacted by the overall economic environment  among other factors 
we perform our annual test in the second quarter of each year 
we determined the fair value of each reporting unit which required us to estimate future cash flows and termination value 
the fair value estimate also depended on  among other things  our weighted average cost of capital and working capital requirements 
estimates can also be impacted by  among other things  expected performance  market valuation of comparable companies  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
there was no indication of impairment based on our analysis 
during our annual test of goodwill  we considered that each of the four reporting units has significant goodwill and intangible assets and that the excess of estimated fair value over the net asset carrying value for all reporting units decreased relative to the prior year test 
as of the date of our may  analysis  the excess of estimated fair value over net asset carrying value of the north american business consulting services reporting unit and the north american dispute and investigative services reporting unit was approximately and of the estimated fair value  respectively 
the excess of estimated fair value over the net asset carrying value of the international consulting operations and economic consulting services reporting units were both approximately of the estimated fair value and given the smaller size of these reporting units the relative dollars of the excess are substantially smaller than for the other two reporting units 

table of contents further  the estimated fair value of the international consulting operations and economic consulting services reporting units may be more volatile due to the reporting units smaller size and higher expected earnings growth rates 
also  given the international consulting operations reporting unit s international market  its fair market value may be more volatile 
additionally  the economic consulting services reporting unit was recently acquired as one acquisition and its fair market value is dependent on the success of such acquisition 
the key assumptions used in our may  analysis include profit margin improvement to be generally consistent with our past historical performance  revenue growth rates slightly ahead of the industry in the near term and discount rates determined based on market comparables for our peer group 
our fair market value estimates were made as of the date of our analysis and are subject to change 
we are required to consider whether or not the fair value of each of the reporting units could have fallen below its carrying value 
we consider elements and other factors including  but not limited to  changes in the business climate in which we operate  attrition of key personnel  unanticipated competition  our market capitalization in excess of our book value  our recent operating performance  and our financial projections 
as a result of this review  we are required to determine whether such an event or condition existed that would require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test prior to our next annual test date 
we continue to monitor these factors and we may perform additional impairment tests as appropriate in future periods 
as of december   we believe there was no indication of impairment related to our goodwill balances 
we review our intangible asset values on a periodic basis 
we review long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or upon the occurrence of any triggering event 
our intangible assets are subject to changes in estimated fair market values which are determined in part based on our operating performance and expectations for the future 
as of december   there was no indication of impairment related to our intangible assets 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our strategic position in several markets 
as we review our portfolio of services  we may exit certain markets or reposition certain service offerings within our business 
this evaluation may result in us redefining our operating segments and may impact a significant portion of one or more of our reporting units 
if such actions occur  they may be considered triggering events that would result in us performing an interim impairment test of our goodwill and an impairment test of our intangible assets 
share based payments we recognize the cost resulting from all share based compensation arrangements  such as our stock option and restricted stock plans  in the financial statements based on their fair value 
management judgment is required in order to i estimate the fair value of certain share based payments  ii determine expected attribution period and iii assess expected future forfeitures 
we treat our employee stock purchase plan as compensatory and record the purchase discount from market price of stock purchases by employees as share based compensation expense 
income taxes we account for deferred income taxes utilizing an asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
when appropriate  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance requires management judgment and could impact our effective tax rate 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
measurement of tax positions requires management judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate 

table of contents other operating costs we recorded expense and related liabilities associated with office closings and excess space reductions related to a plan to reduce office space as other operating costs 
the expense consisted of rent obligations for the offices  net of expected sublease income  and the write down and accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements reflecting the changes in the estimated useful lives of our abandoned offices 
the expected sublease income is subject to market conditions and has been adjusted and may be adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the office closure obligations have been discounted to net present value 
the determination of the expense and related liabilities requires management judgment and could impact our future financial results 
recent accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements effective july the financial accounting standards board issued a codification superseding all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we have adopted this standard and as such have eliminated all reference to standards issued prior to the effective date and replaced them with the new codification references 
recently issued standards in september  guidance was issued on revenue recognition which changes the criteria required to separate deliverables into separate units of accounting when they are sold in bundled arrangements 
previously entities were required to have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value or other third party evidence of fair value 
the elimination of these requirements to separate deliverables into separate units of accounting will put more focus on a vendor s assessment of whether delivered items in multiple element arrangements have standalone value 
the update is effective for arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   however  earlier adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact this adoption will have on our statements of financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
recently adopted standards in august  guidance was issued to clarify the fair value measurement of liabilities when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available and identifies certain valuation techniques to use when measuring the fair value of such a liability 
it also clarifies that no separate input is required relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our statements of financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
in may  guidance was issued on accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
the guidance is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  in accordance with this guidance  we have evaluated subsequent events through the date of this filing 
we do not believe there are any material subsequent events which would require further disclosure 
in april  guidance was issued requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements 
the amendment is effective for all reporting periods ending after june  note fair value of our notes to the consolidated financial statements provides additional required disclosure 
in april  guidance was issued on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasized that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of the multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  
table of contents adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  guidance was issued to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination arising from contingencies be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated 
on june   the effective date  we adopted this guidance and as such impacted our acquisitions after this date 
see note acquisitions of our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  guidance was issued requiring enhanced disclosure regarding an entity s use of derivative instruments  how they are accounted for and their effect on the entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
we adopted the provisions of this amendment as of january  in december  guidance was issued which changes certain aspects for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase 
the guidance also sets forth the disclosures required to be made in the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  as such  our adoption on january  will impact all our acquisitions on or after that date 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risks relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
the interest rate risk is associated with borrowings under our credit agreement and our investment portfolio  classified as cash equivalents 
the foreign currency risk is associated with our operations in foreign countries 
as of december   borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest  in general  based on a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate equal to the higher of a reference prime rate or one half of one percent above the federal funds rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to the fluctuations in libor 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in libor 
our million notional amount interest rate swap effectively fixed our libor base rate on million of our debt at an interest rate of 
based on borrowings under the credit agreement at december  and after giving effect to the impact of our interest rate swap agreement  our interest rate exposure is limited to million of debt  and each quarter point change in market interest rates would result in approximately a million change in annual interest expense 
on june  our million notional amount interest rate swap will mature 
in december  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements of equal amounts with four different banks for an aggregate notional value of million 
these agreements effectively fix million of our libor base rate indebtedness at an average rate of beginning july  these agreements mature concurrent with the maturity of our credit facility in may at december   our investments were primarily limited to a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates rise 
because of the short periods to maturity of these instruments  an increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we operate in foreign countries  which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had net assets of approximately million with a functional currency of the uk pounds sterling and million with a functional currency of the canadian dollar related to our operations in the united kingdom and canada  respectively 
at december   we 
table of contents had net assets denominated in the non functional currency of approximately million 
as such  a ten percent change in the value of the local currency would result in a million currency gain or loss in our results of operations 
subsequent to december  net assets denominated in non functional currency were reduced to less than million
