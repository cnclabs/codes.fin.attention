critical accounting policy in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to reporting the results of operations and financial condition in preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following discussion addresses the company s only critical accounting policy  which is the policy that is most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has reviewed this critical accounting policy and estimates with its audit committee 
refer to the discussion below under allowance for loan losses and note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of allocated and general components 
the allocated component relates to loans that are considered impaired 
for such impaired loans  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or observable market price or collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers all other loans  segregated generally by loan type  and is based on historical loss experience with adjustments for qualitative factors which are made after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss data 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and real estate loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans also include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
these concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal  forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the company does not separately identify individual consumer installment loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower 
based upon this evaluation  management believes the allowance for loan losses of  or of gross loans outstanding at december  is adequate  under prevailing economic conditions  to absorb losses on existing loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was  or of gross loans outstanding 
the increase in the allowance is attributable to a  increase in the specific component of the allowance and a  increase in the general component of the allowance 
the increase in the specific component is due to an increase in specific reserves totaling  for ten loans five construction and land loans  four commercial real estate loans and one commercial loan secured by residential real estate identified as impaired during the year ended december  this was partially offset by a decrease in specific reserves totaling  for loans that were impaired  at both december  and december   and by  for loans charged off during the year that were classified as impaired at december  the increase in the general component of the reserve is primarily due to an increase in the reserve factors and increased loan volume  partially offset by the reclassification of thirteen loans to impaired loans 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is days past due unless the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
consumer installment loans are typically charged off no later than days past due 
past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
management considers all non accrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans to be impaired 
in most cases  loan payments that are past due less than days and the related loans are not considered to be impaired 
allowance for loan losses and non accrual  past due and restructured loans balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial consumer total recoveries loans charged off commercial loans secured by real estate commercial consumer total charge offs balance at end of year net charge offs to average loans allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december and percent of percent of loans in each loans in each category to category to balance total loans balance total loans commercial loans secured by real estate commercial loans construction and land loans consumer home equity loans consumer installment loans non accrual  past due and restructured loans the following represents non accrual and past due loans at december  and december  december  december  non accrual loans accruing loans contractually past due days or more loans past due days or more and still accruing matured loans pending renewal and still accruing total in and  there were no loans considered troubled debt restructurings 
potential problem loans at december   the bank had loans totaling million  which were not disclosed in the table above  and were not on non accrual status  but were deemed to be impaired 
the loans were current with respect to principal and interest 
management of the company has reviewed the collateral for the loans and considers the current specific reserves  if any  on the loans to be adequate to cover potential losses related to the relationships 
deposits total deposits were million at december   an increase of million in comparison to total deposits at december  of million 
the overall growth in deposit balances occurred primarily during the first six months of to fund anticipated increased loan volume 
non interest bearing deposits were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  the balance of interest bearing checking accounts can fluctuate as much as to on a daily basis 
total interest bearing checking  money market and savings deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  time deposits increased to million at december  from million at december   an million increase 
included in time deposits at december  is million in brokered deposits  which includes the company s placement of million in customer deposits and purchase of million in brokered certificates of deposit through the cdars program 
the cdars program offers the bank both reciprocal and one way swap programs which allow customers to enjoy additional fdic insurance for deposits that might not otherwise be eligible for fdic insurance and gives the bank additional access to funding 
as of december   core deposits represented of total deposits compared to at december  the decrease in core deposits as a percentage of total deposits is due to seasonal fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the effect of reduced economic activity in general  on the bank s customer s businesses 
the bank maintains relationships with several deposit brokers and could continue to utilize the services of one or more of such brokers if management determines that issuing brokered certificates of deposit would be in the best interest of the bank and the company 
the greater new haven market is highly competitive 
the bank faces competition from a large number of banks ranging from small community banks to large international banks  credit unions  and other providers of financial services 
the level of rates offered by the bank reflects the high level of competition in our market 
as of december  the bank s maturities of time deposits were less than or greater totals thousands of dollars three months or less over three months to six months over six months to one year over one year to two years over two years to three years over three years other the increase in other assets of  is due mainly to the prepayment in december of fdic insurance premiums totaling  partially offset by the write down in of  in goodwill recorded by the company related to the evergreen asset purchase in average balances  yields  and rates the following table presents average balance sheets daily averages  interest income  interest expense  and the corresponding annualized rates on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and distribution of assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  interest rates and interest differential decreases interest interest increases average income average average income average in interest dollars in thousands balance expense rate balance expense rate income expense interest earning assets loans short term and other investments investments federal funds sold total interest earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment  net allowance for loan losses other total assets interest bearing liabilities time certificates savings deposits money market checking deposits capital lease obligations repurchase agreements total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing deposits accrued expenses and other liabilities shareholder s equity total liabilities and equity net interest income interest spread interest margin average balance includes nonaccruing loans

rate volume variance analysis the following table summarizes the variance in interest income and expense for and resulting from changes in assets and liabilities and fluctuations in interest rates earned and paid 
the changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated to both rate and volume on a pro rata basis

interest income from interest earning assets in compared to declined million due to rates and increased  due to volume 
variances in the cost of interest bearing liabilities in comparison to were due to decreased rate considerations of  offset by increased volume considerations of  the company intends for the bank to continue to emphasize lending to small to medium sized businesses in its market area as its strategy to increase assets under management and to improve earnings 
the bank will seek opportunities through marketing to increase its deposit base  with a primary objective of attracting core non interest checking and related money market deposit accounts  in order to support its earning assets and also by considering additional branch locations and new product and service offerings 
the following are measurements of the company s results of operations in relation to assets and equity  and average equity to average assets for the years ended december  and loss income on average assets loss income on average equity average equity to average assets results of operations the company s net loss for fiscal year was  or basic and diluted loss per share of  compared to net income of  or basic and diluted income per share of in fiscal year the company s net loss for the year ended december  was largely attributable to a provision for loan losses of  for compared to  for the significant increase in the provision for loan losses during is related to a group of ten impaired loans that have been severely impacted by prevailing economic conditions  discussed in more detail under allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the impact of the provision for loan losses  the operating results for the year ended december  compared to were influenced by the following factors net interest income decreased due primarily to lower yields on interest earning assets  offset partially by lower costs on interest bearing liabilities and changes in asset and liability volumes  noninterest income decreased because noninterest income in included the gain on the sale of the new london branch  a decrease in loan fees attributable to a prepayment penalty received in  and due to a decrease in service charges and fees  resulting from changes in the business practices of customers of the bank  and noninterest expenses decreased due to lower salaries and benefits resulting from reductions in staff  both from the sale of the new london branch and other reductions  and the elimination of certain employee benefits and bonuses in in addition  salaries and benefits expense for included expenses related to separation payments made to the former chief executive officer and president of the bank  and there were no such expenses in  expense reductions attributable to lower negotiated rates on certain insurance and telecommunications service contracts  decreases in advertising and promotional campaigns  and expense savings related to printing the company s shareholders letter and proxy statement 
these decreases were partially offset by the impairment write down of goodwill relating to evergreen  an increase in professional service fees  and by higher fdic insurance premiums due to an increase in assessment rates and deposit balances subject to assessment  as well as a special one time assessment paid during net interest income the principal source of revenue for the bank is net interest income 
the bank s net interest income is dependent primarily upon the difference or spread between the average yield earned on loans receivable and securities and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings  as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
the bank  like other banking institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different times  or on a different basis  than its interest earning assets 
for the year ended december   net interest income was  versus  for the same period in the  or decrease was the result of a  decrease in interest income and a  decrease in interest expense 
this net decrease was primarily the result of decreases in rates  partially offset by increases in volume  on both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average total interest earning assets were million during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million or 
the increase in average interest earning assets of million was comprised of increases in average balances of loans of million and short term and other investments of million  partially offset by decreases in average balances of federal funds sold of million and investments of million 
the yield on average interest earning assets for the year ended december  was compared to for  a decrease of basis points 
the decrease in the yield on average earning assets reflects the impact of reductions in the fomc rates  particularly in the prime lending rate  libor and the bank s base lending rate  as well as an increase in non performing assets and an increasingly competitive market to attract new loans 
the combined effects of the basis point decrease in yield on average interest earning assets and the million increase in average balances of interest earning assets resulted in the  decrease in interest income between the year ended december  and the year ended december  the average balance of the company s interest bearing liabilities was million during the year ended december  compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to during the year ended december  compared to for the same period in  which was primarily due to a general decrease in market interest rates 
the combined effects of the basis point decrease in yield on average interest bearing liabilities and the million increase in average balances of interest bearing liabilities resulted in the  decrease in interest expense between the year ended december  and the year ended december  provision for loan losses the bank s provision for loan losses was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the significant increase in the provision for loan losses during the year ended december  was primarily related to specific reserves established for a group of ten impaired loans that have been severely impacted by prevailing economic conditions  discussed in more detail under allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income total noninterest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in noninterest income in included an  gain on the sale of the bank s new london branch 
service charges and fees decreased  due to changes in business practices of customers of the bank during the year ended december  other non interest income decreased to  in from  in  due to decreases in loan prepayment fees  insurance commissions  letter of credit fees  and other fees  partially offset by increases in other loan and sba servicing related fees 
noninterest expenses total noninterest expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for  a decrease of  or salaries and benefits expense for the year ended december  was  versus  for the same period in salaries and benefits expense decreased  or  primarily because of expense savings related to reductions in staff  both from the sale of the new london branch and other reductions  and the elimination of certain employee benefits and bonuses in  as well as the reduction relating to separation payments made to the former chief executive officer and president of the bank in  with no such expenses incurred in fdic insurance expense increased by  from  to  primarily due to increased assessment rates and deposit balances subject to assessment  as well as a one time special assessment of five basis points based upon deposit balances on june  the temporary liquidity guarantee program announcement by the fdic on october  provided banks with the option to fully insure non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
the bank elected to participate in the program  resulting in a basis point annual rate surcharge applied to balances in such accounts over  beginning in professional services for the year ended december  increased by  from  to  primarily due to an increase in legal fees related to the merger announced on february  see note to the consolidated financial statements and accounting fees  partially offset by a reduction in other professional fees 
other operating expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to the  impairment write down of goodwill relating to evergreen  partially offset by expense reductions attributable to lower negotiated rates on certain insurance and telecommunications service contracts  and expense savings related to printing the company s shareholders letter and proxy statement 
the goodwill impairment recognized was due to the recurring operating losses incurred by evergreen since its acquisition  and the uncertainty that such results were not likely to improve in the near future 
off balance sheet arrangements see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for required disclosure regarding off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity the company s liquidity position as of december  and consisted of liquid assets totaling million and million  respectively 
this represents and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the liquidity ratio is defined as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets 
the following categories of assets as described in the accompanying balance sheet are considered liquid assets cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  short term investments  interest bearing certificates of deposit and securities available for sale 
liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to generate adequate cash to meet financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover downward fluctuations in deposits and increases in its loan portfolio 
management believes the company s short term assets provide sufficient liquidity to cover potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and loan demand and to meet other anticipated operating cash and investment requirements 
capital the following table illustrates the company s and the bank s regulatory capital ratios at december company bank capital capital adequacy adequacy target ratio target ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage capital ratio to average assets capital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system 
based on the above ratios  the bank is considered to be well capitalized under applicable regulations 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must generally have a leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
market risk market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
based upon the nature of the company s business  market risk is primarily limited to interest rate risk  which is defined as the impact of changing interest rates on current and future earnings 
the company s goal is to maximize long term profitability  while minimizing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the first priority is to structure and price the company s assets and liabilities to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread  while reducing the net effect of changes in interest rates 
in order to reach an acceptable interest rate spread  the company must generate loans and seek acceptable long term investments to replace the lower yielding balances in federal funds sold and short term investments 
the focus also must be on maintaining a proper balance between the timing and volume of assets and liabilities re pricing within the balance sheet 
one method of achieving this balance is to originate variable loans for the portfolio to offset the short term re pricing of the liabilities 
in fact  a number of the interest bearing deposit products have no contractual maturity 
customers may withdraw funds from their accounts at any time and deposits balances may therefore run off unexpectedly due to changing market conditions 
the exposure to interest rate risk is monitored by senior management of the bank and reported quarterly to the asset and liability management committee and the board of directors 
management reviews the interrelationships within the balance sheet to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this fact  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular  real estate 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect the company s earnings in future periods 
factors affecting future results some of the statements under management s discussion and analysis or plan of operations  business and elsewhere in this annual report on form k may include forward looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
statements which include the words expect  intend  plan  believe  project  anticipate and similar statements of a future or forward looking nature identify forward looking statements for purposes of the federal securities laws or otherwise 
all forward looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties 
accordingly  there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements or that could adversely affect the holders of our common stock 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in prevailing interest rates which would affect the interest earned on the company s interest earning assets and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the timing of re pricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the effect of changes in governmental monetary policy  the effect of changes in regulations applicable to the company and the conduct of its business  changes in competition among financial service companies  including possible further encroachment of non banks on services traditionally provided by banks and the impact of recently enacted federal legislation  the ability of competitors which are larger than the company to provide products and services which it is impractical for the company to provide  the volatility of quarterly earnings  due in part to the variation in the number  dollar volume and profit realized from sba guaranteed loan participation sales in different quarters  the effect of a loss of any executive officer  key personnel  or directors  the effect of the company s opening of branches and the receipt of regulatory approval to complete such actions  concentration of the company s business in southern and southeastern connecticut  the concentration of the company s loan portfolio in commercial loans to small to medium sized businesses  which may be impacted more severely than larger businesses during periods of economic weakness  lack of seasoning in the company s loan portfolio  which may increase the risk of future credit defaults  and the effect of any decision by the company to engage in any business not historically permitted to it 
other such factors may be described in other filings made by the company with the sec 
although the company believes that it has the resources needed for success  future revenues and interest spreads and yields cannot be reliably predicted 
these trends may cause the company to adjust its operations in the future
