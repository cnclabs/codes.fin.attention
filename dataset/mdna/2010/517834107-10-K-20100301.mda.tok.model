operations we view each of our casino properties as an operating segment 
our operating segments in the us consist of the venetian las vegas  the palazzo and sands bethlehem 
the venetian las vegas and the palazzo operating segments are managed as a single integrated resort and have been aggregated into our las vegas operating properties  considering their similar economic characteristics  types of customers  types of service and products  the regulatory business environment of the operations within each segment and the company s organizational and management reporting structure 
approximately and of gross revenue at our las vegas operating properties for the years ended december  and  respectively  was derived from room revenues  food and beverage services  and other non gaming sources  and and  respectively  was derived from gaming activities

development projects given the challenging conditions in the capital markets and the global economy and their impact on our ongoing operations  we revised our development plan to suspend portions of our development projects and focus our development efforts on those projects with the highest expected rates of return on invested capital 
should general economic conditions fail to improve  if we are unable to obtain sufficient funding such that completion of our suspended projects is not probable  or should management decide to abandon certain projects  all or a portion of our investment to date on our suspended projects could be lost and would result in an impairment charge 
in addition  we may be subject to penalties under the termination clauses in our construction contracts or termination rights under our management contracts with certain hotel management companies 
united states development project we were constructing the st 
regis residences  which is located on the las vegas strip between the palazzo and the venetian 
as part of our revised development plan  we suspended our construction activities for the project due to reduced demand for las vegas strip condominiums and the overall decline in general economic conditions 
we intend to recommence construction when demand and conditions improve and expect that it will take approximately months thereafter to complete construction of the project 
macau development projects we submitted plans to the macau government for our other cotai strip developments  which represent three integrated resort developments  in addition to the venetian macao and four seasons macao  on an area of approximately acres which we refer to as parcels  and  and and 
subject to the approval from the macau government  the developments are expected to include hotels  exhibition and conference facilities  gaming areas  showrooms  spas  dining  retail and entertainment facilities and other amenities 
we commenced construction or pre construction on these developments and plan to operate the related gaming areas under our macau gaming subconcession 
we have sequenced the construction of our integrated resort development on parcels and due to difficulties in the capital markets and the overall decline in general economic conditions 
phases i and ii of the integrated resort are expected to feature approximately  shangri la  traders and sheraton branded hotel rooms  approximately  square feet of gaming space  approximately million square feet of retail  entertainment and dining facilities  exhibition and conference facilities and a multipurpose theater 
phase iii of the project is expected to include a fourth st 
regis branded hotel and mixed use tower 
in connection with receiving commitments of billion of project financing in november which we expect to close in march to be used together with a portion of the proceeds from the scl offering  we are recommencing construction of phases i and ii and expect it will take approximately months to complete phase i  an additional six months thereafter to complete the adjacent sheraton tower in phase ii and an additional months thereafter to complete the remaining retail facilities in phase ii 
we intend to complete phase iii of the project as demand and market conditions warrant it 
we have commenced pre construction on parcels  and  and intend to commence construction after the integrated resort on parcels and is complete  necessary government approvals are obtained  regional and global economic conditions improve  future demand warrants it and additional financing is obtained 
singapore development project in august  mbs entered into the development agreement with the stb to build and operate an integrated resort called marina bay sands in singapore

summary financial results the following table summarizes our results of operations year ended december  percent percent change change dollars in thousands net revenues operating expenses operating income loss income loss before income taxes net income loss net income loss attributable to las vegas sands corp percent of net revenues year ended december  operating expenses operating income loss income loss before income taxes net income loss net income loss attributable to las vegas sands corp our historical financial results will not be indicative of our future results as we continue to open new properties  including the marina bay sands on april  key operating revenue measurements operating revenues at our las vegas operating properties  the venetian macao and four seasons macao are dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel  which affects the price that can be charged for hotel rooms and the volume of table games and slot machine play 
hotel revenues are not material for sands macao or sands bethlehem as revenues are principally driven by casino customers who visit the properties on a daily basis 
the following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenue casino revenue measurements for the us table games drop drop and slot handle handle are volume measurements 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of drop or handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
table games drop represents the sum of markers issued credit instruments less markers paid at the table  plus cash deposited in the table drop box 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered or coins placed into slot machines in aggregate for the period cited 
we view table games win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of slot handle 
based upon our mix of table games  our table games produce a statistical average win percentage calculated before discounts as measured as a percentage of drop of to and slot machines produce a statistical average hold percentage calculated before slot club cash incentives as measured as a percentage of handle generally between and 
actual win may vary from the statistical average 
generally  slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis  while approximately of our table games play  for the year ended december   was conducted on a credit basis 
casino revenue measurements for macau macau table games are segregated into two groups  consistent with the macau market s convention rolling chip play all vip players and non rolling chip play mostly non vip players 
the volume measurement for rolling chip play is non negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost 
the volume measurement for non rolling chip play is table games drop as previously described 
rolling chip and non rolling chip volume measurements are not comparable as the amounts wagered are substantially higher than the amounts dropped 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered or coins placed into slot machines in aggregate for the period cited 

table of contents we view rolling chip win as a percentage of rolling chip volume  non rolling chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of slot handle 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of rolling chip volume  non rolling chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
based upon our mix of table games  our rolling chip table games win percentage calculated before discounts and commissions is expected to be and our non rolling chip table games are expected to produce a statistical average win percentage as measured as a percentage of drop of to 
similar to las vegas  our macau slot machines produce a statistical average win percentage as measured as a percentage of handle of generally between and 
actual win may vary from the statistical average 
generally  gaming is conducted on a cash basis  with only of our table games play  for the year ended december   being conducted on a credit basis 
this percentage is expected to increase as we increase the credit extended to our premium players and gaming promoters for table games play 
hotel revenue measurements hotel occupancy rate  which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period  and average daily room rate  which is the average price of occupied rooms per day  are used as performance indicators 
revenue per available room represents a summary of hotel average daily room rates and occupancy 
because not all available rooms are occupied  average daily room rates are normally higher than revenue per available room 
reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit may be re sold to walk in guests 
these rooms are considered to be occupied twice for statistical purposes due to obtaining the original deposit and the walk in guest revenue 
in cases where a significant number of rooms are resold  occupancy rates may be in excess of and revenue per available room may be higher than the average daily room rate

this decrease was offset by million attributable to sands bethlehem and an increase of million attributable to a full year of operations of four seasons macao 
convention  retail and other revenues increased million as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase of million attributable to the mall at four seasons macao due to a full year of operations and million in our other asia segment driven by our passenger ferry service operations in macau as we increased the frequency of sailings and commenced night sailings in the summer of these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million at our las vegas operating properties and million at the venetian macao  primarily driven by the decrease in our convention operations resulting from the decline in global economic conditions

these increases were partially offset by a combined decrease of million at our operating properties driven by our cost cutting measures

the provision for doubtful accounts was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  of the increase  million related to our casino operations as we granted more credit to our premium players in macau in response to the opening of new properties and million related to our mall operations as some of our tenants experienced difficulties driven by reduced visitation and consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn 
the amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the customers who owe us money from gaming activities at any given time 
we believe that the amount of our provision for doubtful accounts in the future will depend upon the state of the economy  our credit standards  our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit
