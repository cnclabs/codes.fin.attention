table of contents part i item business general cardinal health  inc is an ohio corporation formed in as used in this report  we  our  us and similar pronouns refer to cardinal health  inc and its subsidiaries  unless the context requires otherwise 
we are a global healthcare solutions company providing products and services that help hospitals  physician offices and pharmacies reduce costs  improve safety and productivity  and deliver better care to patients 
except as otherwise specified  information in this annual report on form k is provided as of june   which is the end of our fiscal year 
spin off of carefusion corporation on august   we separated the clinical and medical products businesses from our other businesses through a pro rata distribution to shareholders of of the then outstanding common stock of a wholly owned subsidiary  carefusion corporation carefusion 
we refer to this transaction as the spin off 
carefusion s product lines are in the areas of intravenous  infusion  medication and supply dispensing  respiratory care  infection prevention and surgical instruments 
we retained of carefusion common stock  which we are required to dispose of before august   pursuant to the private letter ruling we received from the internal revenue service the irs in connection with the spin off 
as of june   we owned approximately million carefusion shares 
as part of the spin off  cardinal health and carefusion entered into a separation agreement and various other agreements relating to the separation  including a transition services agreement  a tax matters agreement  an employee matters agreement  intellectual property agreements and certain other commercial agreements 
business segments for fiscal  we reported financial information in three segments healthcare supply chain services  clinical and medical products  and all other 
from july  to august   we reported financial information in three different segments pharmaceutical  medical and carefusion 
the pharmaceutical segment included the businesses that were previously within the healthcare supply chain services segment that distributed pharmaceutical  radiopharmaceutical and over the counter healthcare products  as well as the businesses previously within the all other segment 
the medical segment included the remaining businesses within the healthcare supply chain services segment and certain surgical and exam gloves  surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses that were previously within the clinical and medical products segment 
the carefusion segment included the businesses previously within the clinical and medical products segment but not the above referenced surgical and exam gloves  surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses 
all businesses in the carefusion segment were part of the spin off 
once the spin off was completed  our remaining businesses were organized into our current two segments pharmaceutical and medical 
the following business discussion is based on the two segments as they were structured for fiscal pharmaceutical segment the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical  over the counter healthcare  and consumer products through its pharmaceutical distribution business  operates nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities that prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging and other procedures in hospitals and clinics  
table of contents distributes specialty pharmaceutical products and provides third party logistics support services to manufacturers  and franchises retail pharmacies under the medicine shoppe and medicap brands  and provides pharmacy services to hospitals and other healthcare facilities 
the pharmaceutical distribution business is a full service wholesale distributor to retail customers including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers  hospitals  and alternate care providers including mail order pharmacies located throughout the united states and in puerto rico 
pharmaceutical distribution maintains prime vendor relationships that streamline the purchasing process resulting in greater efficiency and lower costs for our customers 
pharmaceutical distribution also helps pharmaceutical manufacturers with services including distribution  inventory management  data reporting  new product launch support  and contract and chargeback administration 
the pharmaceutical distribution business generates gross margin primarily when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost of products sold  net of manufacturer cash discount  branded manufacturer margin  and generic manufacturer margin 
manufacturer cash discounts are price reductions that manufacturers may offer to us for prompt payment of purchased products 
branded manufacturer margin also referred to as branded margin refers to compensation amounts under distribution service agreements with manufacturers and to pharmaceutical price appreciation 
compensation under the distribution service agreements may be a fee based on volume with or without pharmaceutical price appreciation 
a manufacturer may increase its published price for a product after we have purchased that product for inventory 
our contract price for branded pharmaceutical products to customers is based on the manufacturer s published price at the time of sale 
as such  inventory sold following a manufacturer price increase will be based on the higher manufacturer price 
pharmaceutical price appreciation refers to amounts we earn from selling inventory at these increased prices 
generic manufacturer margin also referred to as generic margin refers to price discounts  rebates and other incentives we receive from manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals 
our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals generally are highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices tend to decline over time  although this may vary 
bulk and non bulk customers 
the pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and non bulk customers 
bulk customers consist of retail chain customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses 
all other customers are classified as non bulk customers 
a retail chain pharmacy customer may be both a bulk customer with respect to its warehouse operations and a non bulk customer with respect to its retail stores 
bulk customers can process large quantities of products in central locations 
substantially all deliveries to bulk customers consist of products shipped in the same form that we receive them from the manufacturer  a small portion of deliveries to bulk customers are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping 
in contrast  non bulk customers require more complex servicing 
for non bulk customers  we may receive inventory in large or full case quantities and break it down into smaller quantities  warehouse the product for a longer period of time  pick individual products specific to a customer s order  and deliver that smaller order to a customer location 
bulk customers generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than non bulk customers 
bulk customers receive lower pricing on sales of the same products than non bulk customers due to volume pricing in a competitive market and due to lower costs related to the fewer services we provide 
in 
table of contents addition  sales to bulk customers in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than sales to non bulk customers  because bulk customers orders consist almost entirely of higher cost branded products 
the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk customers is also driven by the impact of branded manufacturer margin and manufacturer cash discounts 
branded manufacturer margin is lower due to the shorter time that products sold to bulk customers are held in inventory by us  allowing less opportunity for pharmaceutical price appreciation 
segment distribution  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers are substantially lower than from non bulk customers because deliveries to bulk customers require substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than deliveries to non bulk customers 
the following table shows the revenues  segment expenses  segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non bulk customers for fiscal  and in millions non bulk customers revenue from non bulk customers segment expenses allocated to non bulk customers segment profit from non bulk customers segment profit from non bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from non bulk customers bulk customers revenue from bulk customers segment expenses allocated to bulk customers segment profit from bulk customers segment profit from bulk customers as a percentage of revenue from bulk customers segment expenses and profit required complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions  past experience and judgment that we believe are reasonable 
in addition  amounts do not include the impact of last in  first out lifo provisions  if any 
we had no lifo provisions in fiscal  and during fiscal  we revised some of the estimates used when allocating expenses between non bulk customers and bulk customers 
prior period information has been adjusted to reflect this change 
see note to the notes consolidated financial statements for pharmaceutical segment revenue  profit and assets for fiscal  and medical segment the medical segment distributes a broad range of medical  surgical and laboratory products to hospitals  surgery centers  laboratories  physician offices and other healthcare providers 
this segment also develops  manufactures and sources our own line of medical and surgical products 
these products include sterile and non sterile procedure kits  single use surgical drapes  gowns and apparel  exam and surgical gloves  and fluid suction and collection systems 
our medical and surgical products are sold directly or through third party distributors in the united states  canada  europe  south america and the asia pacific region 
see note to the notes consolidated financial statements for medical segment revenue  profit and assets for fiscal  and 
table of contents acquisitions and divestitures in the past five fiscal years  we completed the following two significant acquisitions  both of which were transferred to carefusion as part of the spin off 
consideration paid date company location line of business cash stock options converted amounts in millions june  viasys healthcare inc viasys conshohocken  pennsylvania respiratory  neurology  medical disposable and orthopedic products may  enturia inc enturia leawood  kansas infection prevention products represents the date we became the majority shareholder 
as a result of the acquisition  the outstanding stock options of the acquired company were converted into options to purchase common shares issued by us 
this column represents the number of our common shares subject to converted stock options immediately following conversion 
includes the assumption of approximately million in debt  also includes approximately million of shares under equity compensation plans in july includes the assumption of approximately million in debt 
we also completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years  including during fiscal  purchasing the wholesale pharmaceutical  health and beauty and related drugstore products distribution business of the f 
dohmen co 
and certain of its subsidiaries  and the remaining shares of source medical corporation  our canadian joint venture  during fiscal  purchasing specialtyscripts  llc  and during fiscal  purchasing borschow hospital medical supplies  inc on june   we entered into an agreement to acquire healthcare solutions holding  llc  which provides specialty healthcare services 
on july   we completed that acquisition for a million cash payment 
the acquisition agreement also includes earn out payments of up to million over the next three years 
we completed several divestiture transactions during the past five fiscal years  including during fiscal  selling our former pharmaceutical technologies and services segment  other than certain generic focused businesses  for approximately billion in cash  our healthcare marketing services business  and our united kingdom based intercare pharmaceutical distribution business 
during fiscal  consummating the spin off of carefusion corporation  and selling specialtyscripts  llc and our united kingdom based martindale injectable manufacturing business 
customers our largest customers  walgreen co 
walgreens and cvs caremark corporation cvs  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenue for fiscal the aggregate of our five largest customers  including walgreens and cvs  accounted for approximately of our revenue for fiscal we have agreements with group purchasing organizations gpos that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members 
our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with 
table of contents novation  llc  and premier purchasing partners  lp arrangements with these two gpos accounted for approximately of our revenue for fiscal although gpo vendor selections may influence member sourcing decisions  gpo members generally are not required to comply with those vendor selections 
accordingly  we believe that the loss of an agreement with a gpo would not cause the loss of sales to all members of the gpo 
suppliers we rely on many different suppliers 
products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of approximately of our revenue during fiscal  but no single supplier s products accounted for more than of that revenue 
overall  we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good 
the loss of some suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if alternative sources were unavailable at reasonable prices 
the pharmaceutical distribution business is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these agreements generally have terms ranging from one year with an automatic renewal feature to five years 
generally  these agreements are terminable before they expire only if the parties mutually agree  if there is an uncured breach of the agreement  or if one party is the subject of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event 
some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 
our pharmaceutical segment s nuclear pharmacy services business dispenses several products prepared using a particular radioisotope 
at the present time  it is difficult to acquire sufficient quantities of that radioisotope from third party suppliers because of a continued and prolonged shortage of a critical raw material used to derive that radioisotope from two nuclear reactors  which are experiencing prolonged downtimes 
based on information obtained from parties involved with the two affected nuclear reactors  we anticipate the supply of raw material to normalize in the first half of fiscal competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services 
we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development  manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products 
we compete on many levels  including service offerings  support services  breadth of product lines  and price 
in the pharmaceutical segment  we compete with two other national  full line wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of regional wholesale distributors  self warehousing chains  direct selling manufacturers  specialty distributors  third party logistics companies  and nuclear pharmacies  among others 
in addition  the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals  including telemarketers 
in the medical segment  we compete with many different distributors  including owens minor  inc  thermo fisher scientific inc  pss world medical  inc  henry schein  inc  and medline industries  inc 
in addition  we compete with a number of regional medical products distributors and with third party logistics companies 
competitors of the medical segment s development and manufacturing business include kimberly clark corporation  ansell limited  deroyal industries inc  medline industries  inc  and m lnlycke health care 
employees as of june   we had approximately  employees in the united states and approximately  employees outside of the united states 
overall  we consider our employee relations to be good 

table of contents intellectual property we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  and technical measures to protect our products  services and intangible assets 
we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies  and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 
all of these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations 
we enforce our intellectual property rights when they are infringed by others  and will continue to do so  where appropriate 
we have applied in the united states and other countries for registration of a number of trademarks and service marks 
some of our marks are registered  but our applications may not always be granted 
we also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks 
we hold patents relating to aspects of our distribution operations  including our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings 
we also hold patents relating to medical and surgical products and devices  such as fluid suction and irrigation devices  surgical waste management systems  surgical and medical examination gloves  surgical drapes  gowns and facial protection products  and patient temperature management products 
we have a number of pending patent applications in the united states and other countries  and we intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate 
we may not always obtain the patents for which we apply 
we do not consider any particular patent  trademark  license  franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 
regulatory matters our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries 
depending upon their specific business and where they distribute  manufacture and sell their products  our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including the us drug enforcement administration the dea  the us food and drug administration the fda  the us nuclear regulatory commission the nrc  the us department of health and human services hhs  state boards of pharmacy  state controlled substance agencies  state health departments  insurance departments or other comparable state agencies  and foreign agencies that are comparable to those listed above 
these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil  administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal 
they can require us to suspend distribution of products and controlled substances or initiate product recalls  they can seize products or impose significant criminal  civil and administrative sanctions  and they can seek injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products 
distribution 
the dea  fda and various state authorities regulate the marketing  purchase  storage and distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances under various state and federal statutes including the prescription drug marketing act of wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and state level licenses  meet various security and operating standards  and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale  marketing  packaging  storage and distribution of controlled substances 
manufacturing and marketing 
our subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices are subject to regulation by the fda and comparable foreign agencies including regulations regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices and quality systems 
in addition  our medical segment s international manufacturing operations may be subject to local certification requirements 

table of contents the fda and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies administer requirements covering the design  testing  safety  effectiveness  manufacture  labeling  promotion and advertising  distribution and post market surveillance of certain of our manufactured products 
we need specific approval or clearance from regulatory authorities before we can market and sell many of our products in particular countries 
even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product  the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory review 
to assess and facilitate compliance with federal  state and foreign regulatory requirements  we routinely review our quality and compliance systems to evaluate their effectiveness and to identify areas for improvement or remediation 
as part of our quality review  we assess the suppliers of raw materials  components and finished goods that are incorporated into the medical devices we manufacture 
in addition  we conduct quality management reviews designed to highlight key issues that may affect the quality of our products and services 
from time to time  we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications  regulatory requirements  or published standards 
when we identify a quality or regulatory issue  we investigate and take appropriate corrective action  such as withdrawing the product from the market  correcting the product at the customer location  revising product labeling  and notifying customers 
nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 
our nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities require licenses or permits from the nrc  the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate  and the state board of pharmacy 
in addition  the fda regulates cyclotron facilities 
the fda issued regulations  effective december   establishing current good manufacturing practices for positron emission tomography pet drugs 
prescription drug pedigree tracking state and federal agencies are concerned about preventing the introduction of counterfeit  diverted  adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the pharmaceutical supply chain 
some states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating their options 
the fda amendments act of requires the fda to establish standards to identify and validate technologies for securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs 
these standards may include track and trace or authentication technologies  such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies 
in march  the fda issued guidance establishing standardized numerical identifiers sni for prescription pharmaceutical packages 
in december  we entered into a settlement to resolve a civil investigation by the new york attorney general s office focusing on sales and purchases of prescription pharmaceuticals in the secondary market 
pursuant to the settlement  we implemented a number of reforms within the pharmaceutical distribution business  including requirements that customers who are wholesalers certify their compliance with our wholesaler safe product practices 
healthcare fraud and abuse laws we are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
laws and regulations generally prohibit us and others in our industry from soliciting  offering  receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order or purchase items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare  medicaid or other government sponsored healthcare programs 
we also cannot submit or cause to be submitted any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government 
certain of our subsidiaries also maintain contracts with the federal government and are subject to regulatory requirements relating to government contractors 
health information practices services and products provided by some of our businesses involve access to patient identifiable healthcare information 
in the past few years  federal and state officials have focused on the questions of how patient 
table of contents identifiable healthcare information should be handled  which entities should compile that information  and how that work should proceed 
changes in legislation such as the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and its accompanying regulations may affect how some information services or products are provided 
the health information technology for economic and clinical health act  adopted in february  augmented hipaa by increasing existing healthcare privacy requirements  including expanding hipaa s reach to cover additional entities  requiring certain notifications if there is a breach of patient information and increasing penalties associated with noncompliance 
in addition  certain jurisdictions where we do business regulate personal data protection and how information services or products are provided 
franchising laws our franchising operations  through medicine shoppe international  inc and medicap pharmacies incorporated collectively  medicine shoppe  are subject to regulation by the federal trade commission 
in addition  many states have laws that regulate the franchisor franchisee relationship 
environmental laws we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and we have made  and will continue to make  necessary expenditures to comply with applicable laws 
at the present time  we are participating in cleaning up environmental contamination at several sites  none of which are material to us 
health and safety laws we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations  both in the united states and other countries  relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  and the use  transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
laws relating to foreign trade various us and international laws and regulations require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods  raw materials and supplies and the handling of information 
we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations  which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 
similarly  we are subject to laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations  including the us foreign corrupt practices act  foreign anti bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of internal books and records 
these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced some governmental corruption 
other information our distribution businesses generally are not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements 
certain supply contracts with us government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands  but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 
our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned  subject to restocking fees 
we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value  or that can be returned to vendors for credit

item a risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows 
these are not the only risks we face 
our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 
we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 
as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item above  we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
because of competition  our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers 
if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as enhanced cost control measures  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  in recent years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation 
if this consolidation trend continues among our customers and suppliers  it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
we have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue 
as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item above  our sales and credit concentration is significant 
for example  walgreens and cvs accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenue for fiscal the aggregate of our five largest customers  including walgreens and cvs  accounted for approximately of our revenue for fiscal in addition  walgreens and cvs accounted for and  respectively  of our gross trade receivable balance at june  if one or more of our large customers default in payment  terminate or do not renew contracts  or significantly reduce their purchases of our products  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
in addition  approximately of our revenue for fiscal was derived through the contractual arrangements established with two gpos  novation and premier 
gpo members generally are not required to comply with gpo vendor selections 
still  the loss of an agreement with a gpo could cause us to lose customers  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our pharmaceutical segment s margin may be affected by prices established by manufacturers or market forces that are beyond our control 
as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item  we generate a portion of our branded manufacturer margin from pharmaceutical price appreciation 
if branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by smaller amounts  or restrict the amount of inventory available to us  we will earn less branded manufacturer margin 

table of contents in addition  prices for generic pharmaceuticals distributed by our pharmaceutical distribution business tend to decline over time  which could have an adverse effect on our generic manufacturer margin 
the us healthcare environment is changing in many ways  some of which may not be favorable to us  as a result of recent federal healthcare legislation 
our products and services are primarily intended to function within the current structure of the healthcare industry in the united states 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to control costs 
the use of managed care has increased  medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined  distributors  manufacturers  healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated  and large  sophisticated purchasing groups have become more prevalent 
in march  congress approved  and the president signed into law  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the healthcare reform acts 
among other things  the healthcare reform acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to approximately million uninsured americans 
many of the significant changes in the healthcare reform acts do not take effect until  including a requirement that most americans carry health insurance 
we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services  but other provisions of the healthcare reform acts could affect us adversely 
the healthcare reform acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid 
beginning in  each medical device manufacturer will have to pay a tax in an amount equal to of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices 
we manufacture and sell devices that will be subject to this tax 
additionally  the healthcare reform acts changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement to no less than of the average weighted manufacturer s price amp from of the lowest average manufacturer s price for generic pharmaceuticals 
the amp provision is expected to become effective in october we could be adversely affected by  among other things  changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals  medical devices  or healthcare services 
our business requires consistent  diligent and rigorous compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated 
as described above in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item  we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries 
many of our subsidiaries are required to register for permits or licenses with  and to comply with operating and security standards of  regulatory agencies 
if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements  or if allegations are made that we fail to comply  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
to lawfully operate our businesses  we are required to hold permits  licenses and other regulatory approvals from governmental bodies 
failure to maintain or renew  or obtain without significant delay  necessary permits  licenses or approvals could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  in fiscal  the dea suspended licenses to distribute controlled substances held by three of our distribution centers for almost a year because of alleged defects in our controlled substance anti diversion controls 
products that we manufacture  distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements 
noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance could result in product corrective actions  recalls or seizures  warning letters  monetary sanctions  injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products  civil or criminal sanctions  governmental refusal to grant approvals  restrictions on operations  withdrawal of existing approvals and third party claims 
we are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
the scope and applicability of these laws is not always clear 
if we fail to comply with them  we could be subject 
table of contents to federal or state government investigations and resulting civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
the scope or requirements of these laws or regulations may be interpreted or applied by a regulator  prosecutor or judge in a manner that could negatively impact or require us to change our operations 
we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 
we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries 
as a result  we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of many jurisdictions 
from time to time  legislative initiatives are proposed  including proposals to repeal lifo last in  first out treatment of inventory  that could adversely affect our tax positions  effective tax rate or tax payments 
tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others 
we may not be able to defend these challenges successfully  which may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments 
our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 
we rely on information systems to obtain  rapidly process  analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers  receive  process and ship orders on a timely basis  manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers  process payments to suppliers  facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products  and generate financial transactions and information 
our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities  including our national logistics center 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities are interrupted  damaged by unforeseen events or actions of third parties  or fail for any extended period of time 
the medical segment is working on a medical business transformation project  which includes a new information system for supply chain and manufacturing related processes 
the medical segment is planning to transition selected processes to the new system throughout fiscal and if the system is not effectively implemented or fails to operate as intended  it could adversely affect the medical segment s supply chain and manufacturing operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
because of the nature of our business  we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 
due to the nature of our businesses  which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products  we may from time to time become involved in legal proceedings 
for instance  some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party  subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims 
while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute  and we carry product liability insurance  it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could harm our cash flows or results of operations 

table of contents acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be 
historically  an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses 
acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition  we may encounter unforeseen accounting or internal control over financial reporting issues  or the acquired business may have regulatory or compliance issues that we did not anticipate 
we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 
we depend on various components  compounds  raw materials and energy including radioisotopes and oil  oil related and other commodities supplied by others for our operations 
any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters or other events or could be terminated 
a sustained interruption in the flow of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  while we have processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations 
our manufacturing businesses use oil  oil related and other commodities as raw materials in many products 
prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs 
oil and gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years  so our costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated 
because the healthcare industry is highly competitive and many customers and third party payors have instituted cost containment initiatives  we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices 
if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions  or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our global operations are subject to a number of economic  political and regulatory risks 
our global operations are affected by local economic environments  including inflation  recession  currency volatility and competition 
political changes can disrupt our supply chain as well as our customers and operating activities in a particular location 
we may not be able to enter into hedges or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks  and any hedges that we enter into or insurance that we are able to obtain may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 
in addition  our global operations are subject to risks arising from violations of us laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions  and various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations  including those that may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within certain countries or with certain counterparties 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer civil and criminal penalties 
risks associated with the spin off of carefusion 
this section describes some of the risks that exist as a result of the spin off of carefusion  which is described in greater detail in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
carefusion may not satisfy all of its contractual obligations 
we entered into a number of agreements with carefusion that govern the rights and obligations of the parties following the spin off 
we have certain rights under those agreements  including indemnification against certain liabilities allocated to carefusion 
the failure of carefusion to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the transaction may have unexpected tax consequences 
in connection with the spin off  we received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution of carefusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a tax free transaction under sections and a d of the internal revenue code the code 
in addition  we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the spin off would qualify as a transaction that is described in sections a and a d of the code 
the irs private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings from us and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters 
if any of these facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied  we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel 
similarly  the irs could determine on audit that the spin off is taxable if it determines that any of the facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons  including as a result of certain significant changes in stock ownership of either cardinal health or carefusion 
if the spin off is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes  we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities 
we may not be able to capture the full benefits from our minority investment in carefusion 
as of june   we owned approximately million carefusion shares 
as with any investment in a publicly traded company  this investment is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to carefusion s business  as disclosed in carefusion s filings with the sec 
in addition  we entered into an agreement in connection with the spin off under which we committed to vote all of our carefusion shares in proportion to the votes cast by carefusion s other shareholders and we do not have any representation on carefusion s board of directors 
as a result  we are not able to exert control or influence over carefusion to act in a manner that we may believe best for protecting or enhancing the value of our investment 
under the private letter ruling from the irs relating to the spin off  we must dispose of the carefusion shares as soon as practicable after the spin off and consistent with our reasons for retaining the shares  but no later than august  as a result  we may be required to sell some or all of the shares at a time when we might not otherwise choose to do so 
additionally  any disposition of carefusion shares by us in the public market  or the perception that such dispositions could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for carefusion shares and adversely affect the value or the terms and conditions of such disposition

on august   we separated the clinical and medical products businesses from our other businesses through a pro rata distribution to shareholders of of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion and met the criteria for classification of these businesses as discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to plans to sell our united kingdom based martindale injectable manufacturing business within our pharmaceutical segment  and met the criteria for classification of this business as discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we committed to plans to sell our former pharmaceutical technologies and services segment  other than certain generic focused businesses the segment  excluding the certain generic focused businesses that were not sold  is referred to as the pts business and met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations

the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting guidance was a million reduction of retained earnings 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are referring to our continuing operations 
executive overview we are a billion global company serving the healthcare industry with products and services that help hospitals  physician offices and pharmacies reduce costs  improve safety and productivity  and deliver better care to patients 
we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 
our fiscal year was a significant transition year as we completed the spin off of carefusion  transitioned to a new management team  commenced a number of key programs to enhance and refocus our operations and responded to the challenging economic environment and uncertain healthcare industry landscape 
during fiscal  our medical segment profit grew by percent  while continuing to make key strategic investments 
our pharmaceutical segment profit declined by percent  primarily due to pricing changes on renewed customer contracts  the negative impact of actions we took to improve our strategic positioning  the negative impact from the year over year value of generic launches and a severe supply shortage in nuclear pharmacy 
these items were largely offset by our execution on major programs and disciplined cost controls 
our cash and equivalents balance was billion at june   compared to billion at june  the increase was primarily derived from net cash provided by operating activities of billion as a result of earnings and very successful working capital management in fiscal we plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to create shareholder value 
this includes reinvesting in the business  during fiscal we made capital expenditures totaling million  with the majority being in the area of information technology projects 
we may seek to complement our internal capabilities or scale with acquisitions  such as the acquisition of healthcare solutions holding  llc p healthcare that we recently completed during early fiscal during fiscal  we paid quarterly dividends of per share  or per share on an annualized basis 
on may   the board of directors approved an percent increase in the quarterly dividend beginning in july in fiscal we also repurchased million of shares of which million cash settled in july trends as we enter fiscal  we expect low single digit growth in the primary markets that we serve 
actual revenue growth realized in our two segments may vary from market trends based on customer gains and losses  product and customer sales mix shifts  and growth of the specific customers that we serve 
our gross margin has been relatively flat over the past three years and decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily as a result of competitive pressures 
we began a number of business programs to improve gross margin and increase the sales of higher margin products  which had some success in fiscal going forward  our gross margin could be influenced by the rates of growth in our key markets  product and customer sales mix  competitive pricing intensity  sourcing activity  the rate and value of generic pharmaceutical launches  and price changes for our products  including generic and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation or deflation 
our pharmaceutical segment s nuclear pharmacy services business dispenses several products prepared using a particular radioisotope 
at the present time  it is difficult to acquire sufficient quantities of that 
table of contents radioisotope from third party suppliers because of a continued and prolonged shortage of a critical raw material used to derive that radioisotope from two nuclear reactors  which are experiencing prolonged downtimes 
based on information obtained from parties involved with the two affected nuclear reactors  we anticipate the supply of raw material to normalize in the first half of fiscal within the medical segment  variability in the cost of raw materials such as oil  oil related and other commodities can have a significant impact on the cost of products sold 
in fiscal  we anticipate a negative year over year impact from higher commodity prices 
in march  congress approved  and the president signed into law  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act the health reform acts 
the health reform acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to approximately million uninsured americans 
many of the significant changes in the healthcare reform acts do not take effect until  including a requirement that most americans carry health insurance 
although we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services  the overall effect of the provisions of the health reform acts on us is uncertain and could be adverse 
the health reform acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid 
we could be adversely affected by  among other things  changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals  medical devices or healthcare services 
in addition  beginning in  each medical device manufacturer will have to pay a tax in an amount equal to of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices 
we manufacture and sell medical devices that will be subject to this tax 
acquisitions and divestitures in july  subsequent to the end of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of p healthcare for a cash payment of million 
the acquisition agreement also includes earn out payments of up to million over the next three years 
with this acquisition  we plan to expand our presence in specialty pharmaceutical services and distribution 
p healthcare s results will be reported within our pharmaceutical segment 
we consider acquisitions to expand our role as a provider of services and innovative products to the healthcare industry  especially those that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with  and strengthen  the acquired business 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to successfully take advantage of any such opportunity if and when it arises or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
as additional transactions are pursued or consummated  we would incur additional acquisition related charges  and may need to enter into funding arrangements for such acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction will be successful 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold our united kingdom based martindale injectable manufacturing business martindale for million 
spin off of carefusion corporation on august   we separated the clinical and medical products businesses from our other businesses through a pro rata distribution to shareholders of approximately of the then outstanding shares of carefusion common stock the spin off 
we retained certain surgical and exam gloves  surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses that were previously part of our clinical and medical products business 
as explained elsewhere in this form k  the spin off had a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
during fiscal  we sold approximately million shares of the million shares of carefusion common stock that we held immediately after the spin off for million  which resulted in a gross pre tax realized gain of approximately million 
as of june   our ownership of approximately million 
table of contents shares of carefusion common stock had an estimated fair value of million 
under the private letter ruling from the irs relating to the spin off  we must dispose of the carefusion shares as soon as practicable after the spin off and consistent with our reasons for retaining the shares  but no later than august  carefusion has registered the carefusion stock we own with the sec  although we may sell the stock under an exemption from registration 
the net assets of carefusion are presented separately as assets from businesses held for sale and discontinued operations and its operating results are presented within discontinued operations for all reporting periods through the date of the spin off 
our continuing relationship with carefusion on july   we entered into a separation agreement with carefusion to effect the spin off and provide a framework for our relationship with carefusion after the spin off 
in addition  on august   we entered into a transition services agreement  a tax matters agreement  an employee matters agreement  intellectual property agreements and certain other commercial agreements with carefusion 
these agreements  including the separation agreement  provide for the allocation of assets  employees  liabilities and obligations including investments  property and employee benefits and tax related assets and liabilities attributable to periods prior to  at and after the spin off and govern certain relationships between carefusion and us after the spin off 
pursuant to our transition services agreement with carefusion  for fiscal we recognized approximately million in transition service fee income which approximately offsets the costs associated with providing the transition services 
additionally  during fiscal we purchased million of carefusion trade receivables pursuant to an accounts receivable factoring arrangement between carefusion and us 
under the tax matters agreement in connection with the spin off  carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the spin off 
as of june   we have a million indemnification receivable on our balance sheet related to this item

sales volume growth in pharmaceutical distribution had a positive impact of million 

table of contents within nuclear pharmacy  for fiscal  the negative impact of the isotope supply shortage was largely offset by the use of alternative isotopes and the favorable impact of cost of materials savings from conversion to generic products

included within sg a were million and million of costs related to the spin off for fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal cost control programs enabled us to decrease sg a expenses in fiscal by million even though we incurred higher bad debt expense million

as approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management  the expenses for such projects are retained at corporate 
in addition  spin off costs included within sg a are not allocated to our segments 
pharmaceutical segment the principal drivers for the decrease during fiscal were pricing changes on renewed customer contracts  fewer significant generic pharmaceutical launches than the prior year and the medicine shoppe franchise transformation 
the decline in segment profit was partially offset by contributions from our generic programs  disciplined cost controls and solid branded margin growth 
the principal drivers for the increase during fiscal were increased volume and contributions from new generic launches 
the increase was partially offset by pricing changes on renewed customer contracts  the impact from anti diversion activities and bad debt expense 
segment profits from sales to bulk customers as a percentage of pharmaceutical segment profit were  and in fiscal  and the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to pricing changes on renewed bulk customer contracts 
medical segment the principal drivers for the increase during fiscal were growth in sales to certain existing customers and decreased cost of raw materials associated with commodity price movements 
segment profit growth was partially dampened from increased spending on strategic projects 
the decrease during fiscal was primarily due to increased cost of raw materials associated with commodity price movements and the negative impact of foreign exchange

loss on extinguishment of debt on september   we completed a debt tender for up to billion of certain outstanding debt securities  ultimately purchasing more than billion 
the offer was funded by a billion cash distribution received from carefusion immediately prior to the spin off 
in connection with the debt tender  we incurred a pre tax loss for the early retirement of debt of approximately million  which included an early tender premium of million  the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs  and an offsetting million fair value adjustment to the debt related to previously terminated interest rate swaps

table of contents provision for income taxes generally  fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and us state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items 
a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows for fiscal  and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation fiscal year ended june  provision at federal statutory rate state and local income taxes  net of federal benefit foreign tax rate differential unremitted foreign earnings and capital gain from repatriation valuation allowances other effective income tax rate fiscal compared to fiscal the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a charge of million  or percentage points  attributable to earnings no longer indefinitely invested offshore 
the fiscal effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by percentage points due to changes in our business mix which resulted in a higher percentage of our pretax income being generated in the us than in lower tax rate international jurisdictions 
a favorable audit settlement with a state taxing authority in fiscal see below also unfavorably impacted the year over year comparison of the effective tax rate 
fiscal compared to fiscal the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by percentage points due to changes in our business mix which resulted in a higher percentage of our pretax income being generated in the u 
s than in lower tax rate international jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by percentage points due to an audit settlement with a state taxing authority 
in addition  the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by percentage points due to the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset established for a capital loss carryforward 
ongoing audits the irs currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years through we have received proposed adjustments from the irs related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us 
the irs proposed additional taxes of million  excluding penalties and interest 
if this tax ultimately must be paid  carefusion is liable under the tax matters agreement for million of the total amount 
we disagree with these proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them  but we believe our reserves for these matters are adequate 
earnings from discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations were million for fiscal carefusion operating results are included within earnings from discontinued operations for all periods through the date of the spin off 
earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax  decreased by million during fiscal primarily because carefusion s earnings declined in large part because hospitals deferred capital spending 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we currently believe that  based upon available capital resources cash on hand and ownership of shares of carefusion common stock  projected operating cash flow  and access to committed credit facilities  we have adequate access to capital resources to fund working capital needs  currently anticipated capital expenditures  business growth and expansion  contractual obligations  current and projected debt service requirements  dividends and share repurchases 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired p healthcare using cash on hand 
if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions  depending on the size and timing of such transactions  we may need supplemental funding 
capital resources cash and equivalents our cash and equivalents balance was billion at june   compared to billion at june  the increase was primarily derived from net cash provided by operating activities of billion 
net cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by net earnings and changes in working capital 
changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases  customer payments of accounts receivable  and payments to vendors during the regular course of business 
we use days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and days payable outstanding dpo to evaluate our working capital performance 
dso is calculated as trade receivables  net divided by average daily revenue during the last month of the reporting period 
dioh is calculated as inventories divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period 
dpo is calculated as accounts payable divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period 
chargeback billings are the difference between a product s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price established between the vendors and the end customer 
fiscal year ended june  days sales outstanding days inventory on hand days payable outstanding focused efforts to manage customer accounts and reduce delinquency rates have led to improved dso 
the significant improvement in dioh was largely due to enhanced efficiency in our supply chain operations to reduce inventory requirements 
the change in dpo during fiscal was largely driven by a change in payable terms with a supplier in our pharmaceutical segment 
during fiscal  we deployed million on capital expenditures  million on dividends and million on share repurchases an additional million repurchased during fiscal settled during fiscal as part of our balanced capital deployment strategy 
during fiscal  we received million in proceeds from sale of carefusion common stock and million from the divestitures of our martindale business in the united kingdom and specialtyscripts 
in addition  we completed a debt tender resulting in the purchase of more than billion debt securities using cash of billion distributed to us from carefusion in connection with the spin off

also during fiscal  we received million from the issuance of long term obligations and million from shares issued under our share based compensation plans 
the cash and equivalents balance at the end of fiscal included million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states 
although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation  bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal  state and local income tax obligations 
as a us parent company  we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax by taking intercompany loans 
the previously disclosed cash held by our foreign subsidiaries does not include intercompany loans of million and million from our foreign entities which are currently planned to be repaid by fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the net cash provided by discontinued operations for fiscal of billion primarily reflected permanent financing obtained by carefusion prior to the spin off offset by million cash funding provided by us to carefusion pursuant to the spin off separation agreement 
net cash provided by used in discontinued operations for fiscal and of million and million  respectively  primarily related to the earnings and changes in working capital for carefusion 
ownership of shares of carefusion common stock during fiscal  we sold approximately million shares of the million shares of carefusion common stock that we held immediately after the spin off  which resulted in cash proceeds of million 
as of june   our remaining million shares of carefusion common stock had an estimated fair value of million 
under the private letter ruling from the irs relating to the spin off  we must dispose of the carefusion shares as soon as practicable after the spin off and consistent with our reasons for retaining the shares  but no later than august  carefusion has registered the carefusion stock owned by us with the sec  although we may sell the stock under an exemption from registration 
credit facilities and commercial paper our sources of liquidity include a billion revolving credit facility and a million committed receivables sales facility program 
we also have a commercial paper program of up to billion  backed by the revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at june  our ability to access the commercial paper market is limited based on our current credit rating from moody s investor services 
our revolving credit facility and receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of any fiscal quarter end of at least to and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to as of june   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
long term obligations as of june   we had total long term obligations of billion compared to billion at june  the decrease in long term obligations was primarily driven by the debt tender completed in september  resulting in the purchase of more than billion debt securities 
additionally  in october  we repaid our million floating rate notes that had reached their maturity 
during fiscal  we repaid million of notes that had reached their maturity and we also repaid million for the preferred debt securities 

table of contents capital expenditures capital expenditures during fiscal  and of million  million and million  respectively  primarily related to information technology projects and investments to improve the efficiency of our distribution facilities 
fiscal capital expenditures included million to repurchase assets under an operating lease arrangement 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be generally in line with the level of spending in fiscal we anticipate that we will be able to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities 
fiscal capital expenditures will be largely focused on information technology projects 
dividends during fiscal  we paid quarterly dividends of per share  or per share on an annualized basis 
on may   our board of directors approved an percent increase in the quarterly dividend to per share  or per share on an annualized basis  payable on july  to shareholders of record on july  on august   our board of directors approved our th consecutive regular quarterly dividend 
share repurchases during fiscal  we repurchased million of our common shares  of which million cash settled in july during july and august  we repurchased an additional million of our common shares which completes share repurchases under our current board authorization 
we funded the repurchases through available cash 
during fiscal  we did not repurchase any of our common shares 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately billion of our common shares 
a portion of the after tax net proceeds of approximately billion from the sale of our pts business were used to repurchase shares during the first quarter of fiscal interest rate and currency risk management we use foreign currency forward contracts  interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability 
we also use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt 
see item a below as well as notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency  interest rate and commodity exposures 
contractual obligations as of june   our contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by period  are as follows in millions thereafter total on balance sheet long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations other long term liabilities unsettled share repurchases off balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations represents maturities of our long term debt obligations excluding capital lease obligations described below

table of contents represents maturities of our capital lease obligations included within long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet and the related estimated future interest payments 
represents cash outflows by period for certain of our long term liabilities in which cash outflows could be reasonably estimated 
certain long term liabilities  such as unrecognized tax benefits and deferred taxes  have been excluded from the table above because of the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflows 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
represents minimum rental payments and the related estimated future interest payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms  including the following fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur 
purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table 
in addition  contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period 
off balance sheet arrangements see liquidity and capital resources capital resources above and note in notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference  for a discussion of off balance sheet arrangements 
recent financial accounting standards see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 
critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations for continuing operations and ii require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
because our estimates are inherently uncertain  actual results may differ 
in this section  we describe the policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables amounts owed to us through our operating activities are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also provide financing to various customers 
such financing arrangements range from days to years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation 
financings may be collateralized  guaranteed by third parties or unsecured 
finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets 
we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves 
we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging  industry trends  customer financial strength and credit standing  historical write off trends and payment history 
we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 

table of contents reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic  business and market trends 
in addition  reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate 
we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 
the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year ended june  allowance for doubtful accounts in millions allowance as a percentage of customer receivables allowance as a percentage of revenue reduction to allowance for customer deductions and write offs in millions addition to allowance in millions a hypothetical increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables  sales type leases and finance notes receivables at june   would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately million 
we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal are appropriate 
at this time  we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 
inventories a substantial portion of inventories at june   and at june  is stated at the lower of cost  using the lifo last in  first out method  or market 
these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment 
the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory 
prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise  which results in an increase in cost of products sold  whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline  which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 
the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold  so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue 
using lifo  if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline  the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time  so our older inventory is held at a lower cost 
conversely  if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline  future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time  so our older inventory is held at a higher cost 
we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities 
accordingly  the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
in fiscal and  we did not record any lifo reserve reductions 
the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost  using the fifo first in  first out method  or market 
if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities  the value of inventories would not have changed in fiscal or fiscal in fact  primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline  inventories at lifo were million and million higher than the average cost value as of june   and  respectively 
however  we do not record inventories in excess of current market value 

table of contents inventories recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  which were million at june   and million at june  we determine reserves for inventory obsolescence based on historical experiences  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required 
however  these reserves are unlikely to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
impairment testing involves a comparison of estimated fair value to the respective carrying amount 
if estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment which would be recorded as an expense to our results of operations 
application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment  including but not limited to  the identification of reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
in fiscal  we identified three reporting units pharmaceutical segment excluding our nuclear and pharmacy services division  medical segment and nuclear and pharmacy services division 
fair values can be determined using market  income or cost based approaches 
our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of income based and market based approaches 
under the market based approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses  or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets 
under the income approach  we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return 
to further confirm the fair value  we compare our aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 
we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
due to the spin off and reorganization of the reporting units  goodwill was also tested for impairment in the first quarter of fiscal based on this analysis there was no impairment 
we also performed annual impairment testing in fiscal and using similar fair value approaches  however  our market based approach historically included a review of the price earnings ratio for publicly traded companies that were similar in nature  scope and size to our reporting units to the extent available 
based on this analysis there was no impairment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by  there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of our reporting units for fiscal or vendor reserves in the ordinary course of business  our vendors may dispute deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them 
these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors  we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims 
we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review 
though the transaction types are relatively consistent  we periodically refine our 
table of contents estimate methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience 
changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 
vendor reserves were million at june   and million at june  approximately of the vendor reserve at june   pertained to the pharmaceutical segment  compared to at the end of fiscal the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period to period  timing of settlements  and specific vendor issues  such as bankruptcies 
the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment 
we believe  however  that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
provision for income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
the following table presents information about our tax position year ended june  net deferred income tax assets in millions net deferred income tax liabilities in billions net loss and credit carryforwards included in net deferred income tax assets in millions net valuation allowance in millions against deferred tax assets this valuation allowance primarily relates to federal  state and international loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after applying the valuation allowances  we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the unrecognized tax benefits 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease by million for fiscal share based compensation all share based payments to employees  including grants of options  are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of stock options is 
table of contents determined using a lattice valuation model 
we believe the lattice model provides for better estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 
during  we calculated separate option valuations for two separate groups of employees 
during fiscal and  we calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees 
the groups were determined using similar historical exercise behaviors 
the expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant years 
as required  the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests 
the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks 
these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange  interest rate  and commodity related changes 
we maintain a comprehensive hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational  economic  and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity by nature of our global operations  our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation 
these exposures are transactional and translational in nature 
since we manufacture and sell products throughout the world  our foreign currency risk is diversified 
principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar  european euro  mexican peso  and thai baht 
transactional exposure our businesses transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
as part of our risk management program  at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year 
the fiscal and fiscal analyses utilize a currency portfolio model  encompassing both implied volatility and historical correlation to estimate the net potential gain or loss 
these analyses included the estimated impact of our hedging program  which mitigates our businesses transactional exposure 
at june  and  we had hedged approximately and  respectively  of our businesses transactional exposures 
the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to our businesses transactional exposure in millions net estimated transactional exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss translational exposure our businesses also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars  our functional currency 
we perform a similar analysis as described above related to this 
table of contents translational exposure 
we do not typically hedge any of our translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in our analysis at june  and the following table summarizes our businesses translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical strengthening or weakening in the us dollar in millions net estimated translational exposure sensitivity gain loss interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management 
we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 
as part of our risk management program  we annually perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year 
this analysis assumes a hypothetical change in interest rates 
at june  and  the potential increase or decrease in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was million and million  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity we purchase certain commodities for use in our manufacturing and distribution processes  which include latex  nitrile  diesel fuel and polypropylene  among others 
we typically purchase these commodities at market prices  and as a result  are affected by price fluctuations 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year 
at june  and  we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the table below summarizes our analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical fluctuation in commodity prices as of june  and in millions estimated commodity exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss we also have exposure to certain energy related commodities  including natural gas and electricity through our normal course of business 
these exposures result primarily from operating our distribution  manufacturing  and corporate facilities 
in certain deregulated markets  we from time to time enter into long term purchase contracts to supply these items at a specific price
