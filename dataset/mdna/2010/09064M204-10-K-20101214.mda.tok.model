item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
some of the information in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this form k  including our plans and strategies for our business  includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
please review the forward looking statements and the risk factors sections of this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those anticipated or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for diabetes that may be safer  more effective and more convenient for patients 
we develop our product candidates by applying our proprietary formulation technologies to existing drugs in order to improve their therapeutic profiles 
our most advanced product candidate is linjeta tm formerly known as viaject 
we have formulated linjeta tm as a rapid acting mealtime insulin for the treatment of patients with type and type diabetes 
earlier stage product candidates include follow on and second generation rapid acting mealtime insulins or insulin analogs  viatab tm  a sublingual tablet formulation of insulin  a line of basal insulins  and a stabilized formulation of glucagon 
linjeta tm is our proprietary injectable formulation of recombinant human insulin designed to be absorbed into the blood faster than the currently marketed rapid acting insulin analogs 
we have recently completed two pivotal phase clinical trials of linjeta tm  one in patients with type diabetes and the other in patients with type diabetes 
in both clinical trials we compared linjeta tm to humulin r  a form of recombinant human insulin 
based upon our preclinical and clinical data  we believe linjeta tm may produce a profile of insulin levels in the blood that approximates the natural first phase insulin release following a meal that is normally seen in persons without diabetes following a meal 
in november  we announced that the fda issued a complete response letter requesting additional information regarding our nda for linjeta tm 
the complete response letter stated that the fda s review cycle was complete and that the application could not be approved in its present form 
the fda requested that we conduct two new phase clinical trials using the final commercial formulation of linjeta tm  one in patients with type diabetes and the other in patients with type diabetes  to establish efficacy and safety as related to hypoglycemia and toleration 
the fda also requested additional data related to stability and manufacturing of our final commercial formulation of linjeta tm 
in addition  the fda indentified resolution of manufacturing issues related to recent site inspections at hyaluron  inc and wockhardt  ltd 
as a requisite for approval 
we have contacted the fda to formally request a meeting to discuss the complete response letter 
we are a development stage company 
we were incorporated in december and commenced active operations in january to date  we have generated no revenues and have incurred significant losses 
we have financed our operations and internal growth through our initial public offering in may  a follow on offering in february  a registered direct offering in august and  prior to these public offerings  private placements of convertible preferred stock and other securities 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
our net loss was million for the year ended september  as of september   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
the deficit accumulated during the development stage is attributable primarily to our research and development activities and non cash charges for accretion of beneficial conversion rights and deemed dividend warrants and share based compensation 
research and development and general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net loss applicable to common stockholders  represent approximately and  respectively  of the expenses that we have incurred since our inception 
we expect to continue to generate significant losses as we continue to develop our product candidates 

table of contents to date  we have not generated revenues and we expect to incur operating losses as we continue our efforts to seek fda approval of linjeta tm or advance follow on and second generation rapid acting mealtime insulins or insulin analogs 
as of september   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to million in cash and cash equivalents as of september  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least through the first quarter of fiscal year if the august warrants are exercised  we anticipate the cash runway to extend at least through the second quarter of fiscal year we believe that future cash expenditures will be partially offset by raising additional capital from the capital markets  registered direct deals  proceeds derived from collaborations  including  but not limited to  upfront fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties 
we can give no assurances that such funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
we may be required to secure alternative financing arrangements and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
financial operations overview revenues to date  we have generated no revenues 
we do not expect to begin generating any revenues unless any of our product candidates receive marketing approval or if we receive payments in connection with strategic collaborations that we may enter into for the commercialization of our product candidates 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of the cost associated with our basic research activities  as well as the costs associated with our drug development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
our research and development expenses consist of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  third party manufacturing organizations and consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits for the personnel involved in our preclinical and clinical drug development and manufacturing activities  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
while we have reduced expenditures on our earlier stage product candidates  we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the next several years as we conduct preclinical studies and phase clinical trials to determine whether one or more of our newer insulin formulations is likely to offer a combination of pharmacokinetic  stability and tolerability characteristics that is preferable to linjeta tm  determine our preferred development  clinical and regulatory program for a proprietary rapid acting insulin or insulin analog formulation following our meeting with the fda regarding linjeta tm  and based on our analysis of the preclinical and phase clinical data for our alternate insulin formulations  conduct preclinical studies with earlier stage product candidates and make limited investments in order to advance proof of concept formulations  and purchase recombinant human insulin and other materials as required under existing contractual commitments 
we have used our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects and our drug development program for linjeta tm 
to date  we have not tracked expenses related to our product development 
table of contents activities on a project or program basis 
accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of research and development expenses that we incurred with respect to each of our clinical and preclinical product candidates 
however  substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date are attributable to our linjeta tm program 
the following table illustrates  for each period presented  our research and development costs by nature of the cost 
december  inception to year ended september  september  in thousands research and development expenses preclinical expenses manufacturing expenses clinical regulatory expenses total the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to respond to the complete response letter regarding our nda for linjeta tm in a timely manner and the possibility that information we provide in response to the letter may not be sufficient for the approval of linjeta tm or another rapid acting insulin or insulin analog by the fda  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca and the degree to which we are able to clarify with the fda related regulatory requirements  our ability to conduct the additional pivotal clinical trials the fda requested in the complete response letter or other tests or analyses required by the fda to secure approval to commercialize linjeta tm  our ability to develop and commercialize formulations of linjeta tm or other rapid acting insulin or insulin analog formulations that may be associated with less injection site discomfort than the formulation that is the subject of the complete response letter we received from the fda  the progress  timing or success of our product candidates  particularly linjeta tm  and that of our research  development and clinical programs  including any resulting data analyses  the cost to develop an insulin pen for use with linjeta tm and a formulation of linjeta tm for use in insulin pumps  the costs of pre commercialization activities  if any  the costs associated with qualifying and obtaining regulatory approval of suppliers of insulin and manufacturers of our product candidates  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and the terms and success of the collaborations  including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from potential strategic collaborators 

table of contents a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of linjeta tm or our other product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with product development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including share based compensation expenses  in our executive  legal  accounting  finance and information technology functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense  travel expenses  costs associated with industry conventions and professional fees  such as legal and accounting fees and consulting costs 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will change as we focus our efforts on preclinical and phase studies 
over the longer term  however  these expenses could increase as we approach the commercial launch of linjeta tm or our other product candidates 
restricted cash restricted cash as of september  consisted of thousand held in a money market account with a bank to secure a credit card purchasing agreement utilized to facilitate employee travel and certain ordinary purchases 
the restricted cash balance as of september  was marketable securities in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic  investments in debt and equity securities issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb in may  our marketable securities were classified as available for sale 
in accordance with that standard  these securities are reported at market value with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we regularly evaluate the performance of these investments individually for impairment  taking into consideration the investment  volatility and current returns 
if a determination is made that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the related securities are written down to their estimated fair value 
as of september  and  the company had and of million marketable securities investments  respectively 
pre launch inventory inventory costs associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit 
if the probability of future commercial use and future economic benefit cannot be reasonably determined  then costs associated with pre launch inventory that has not yet received regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense during the period the costs are incurred 
for the year ended september   we expensed million of costs associated with the purchase of recombinant human insulin  as research and development expense after it passed quality control inspection and transfer of title occurred 
in november  we announced that the fda has issued a complete response letter requesting additional information regarding the company s nda for linjeta tm 
the complete response letter stated that the fda s review cycle was complete and that the application could not be approved in its present form 
at this time  the company will continue to expense pre launch inventory as research and development 
the pre launch inventory treatment will be reevaluated if we complete phase clinical trials of linjeta tm or an alternate product candidate for which the inventory is applicable and file a related nda or nda supplement for review by the fda 
warrant liability on august   we entered into definitive agreements to sell to two institutional investors  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock with an initial exercise price of per share 
subsequently  on december   the exercise price of the warrants was re set to per share 
these warrants are measured at fair value using 
table of contents an accepted valuation model which takes in account  as of the valuation date  factors including the current exercise price  the expected life of the warrant  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  expected dividends on the stock  the risk free interest rate for the term of the warrant and the probability of a change of control 
the liability is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized currently in the statements of operations under the caption adjustment to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
these warrants will expire on december   one year and trading days after receiving the complete response letter from the fda 
comprehensive loss comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and changes in equity for unrealized holding gains losses on marketable securities during the period 
for the years ended september   and  the company had   and  of comprehensive loss 
interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  resulting primarily from the million in net proceeds received from our initial public offering in may  follow on offering in february  and registered direct offering in august in november  our board of directors approved investment policy guidelines  the primary objectives of which are the preservation of capital  the maintenance of liquidity and maintenance of appropriate fiduciary control subject to our business objectives and tax situation 
due to the uncertainty in the credit and financial markets  along with receiving a complete response letter from the fda  we have maintained our investment strategy of primarily investing in certain marketable securities  which consist primarily of short to intermediate term debt securities issued by the us government  treasury securities and us government agencies 
the focus on preserving cash and investing in stable securities generated lower returns during the year ended september  we intend to maintain this conservative strategy until the credit and financial markets improve and become more stable 
exercise of warrants in march  we offered the holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock and an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share the opportunity to exercise such warrants at an exercise price of  representing a discount in the exercise price 
such holders exercised all of such warrants on a combination of cashless and cash exercise basis 
we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received aggregate cash proceeds of approximately million in connection with such exercises 
as a result of the discounted exercise price  in the fiscal quarter ended march   we recorded a deemed dividend charge of approximately million for the warrants that were so exercised 
as of september   we had the following warrants outstanding i warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of and ii warrants to purchase  share of our common stock with an initial exercise price of per share 
subsequently  on december   the exercise price of the warrants was re set to per share 
these warrants will expire on december   one year and trading days following our receipt of the fda s complete response letter for linjeta tm 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported expenses during the reporting 
table of contents periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this form k  we believe that the following accounting policies  which we have discussed with our audit committee  are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals in preparing our financial statements  we must estimate accrued expenses pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturers that conduct and manage preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacture product for these trials on our behalf 
this process involves communicating with relevant personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for services when we have not yet been invoiced for or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
the financial terms of these agreements vary and may result in uneven payment flows 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimates at any balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
share based compensation in march  our shareholders approved a new stock incentive plan  or the plan 
up to  shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the plan  plus shares of common stock underlying already outstanding awards under our prior plans 
the contractual life of options granted under the plan may not exceed seven years 
the plan uses a fungible share concept under which any awards that are not a full value award will be counted against the share limit as one share for each share of common stock and any award that is a full value award will be counted against the share limit as shares for each one share of common stock 
we have not made any new awards under any prior equity plans after march  the effective date the plan was approved by our stockholders 
we will continue to use the black scholes pricing model to assist in the calculation of fair value 
the expected life for these grants was calculated in accordance with the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab topic d in accordance with sab no 
the simplified method was chosen due to our limited history 
until we have adequate history  we will continue to utilize the simplified method 
we recognize compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  in the financial statements based on fair value 
the fair value of the stock underlying the options is a significant factor in determining credits or charges to operations appropriate for the share based payments to both employees and non employees 
we selected the black scholes valuation model as the most appropriate valuation method for stock option grants to employees  members of our board of directors and non employees 
the fair value of these stock option grants is estimated as of their date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 

table of contents because we lack sufficient company specific historical and implied volatility information  we based our estimate of expected volatility on the median historical volatility of a group of publicly traded companies that we believe are comparable to us based on the criteria set forth in accounting standards codification asc topic c and sab topic d  particularly line of business  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
we will continue to consistently apply this process using the same companies or  if those companies become no longer comparable  other appropriately comparable companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available 
however  we will regularly review these comparable companies  and may substitute more appropriate companies if facts and circumstances warrant a change 
we use the average of the weighted average vesting period and the contractual life of the option  seven or eight years  as the estimated term of the option 
the risk free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the yield of a us treasury strip on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award 
we estimate forfeitures based on actual forfeitures during our limited history 
additionally  we have assumed that dividends will not be paid 
for options granted to non employees and non directors  primarily consultants serving on our scientific advisory board  we measure fair value of the equity instruments utilizing the black scholes valuation model  if that value is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration or service received 
the fair value of these equity investments are periodically revalued as the options vest and are recognized as expense over the related period of service or the vesting period  whichever is longer 
as of september   we issued to these non employees options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
because we must revalue these options for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the share based compensation expense related to these non employee options will increase or decrease  based on changes in the price of our common stock 
for the years ended september   and  the share based compensation expense income related to these options was million  million  and million  respectively 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at september   we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of approximately million  as our management believes it is uncertain that it will be fully realized 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination 
as of september   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for us federal and million for state tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards expire between and to the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available  we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
we have performed a preliminary section analysis in connection with the registered direct offering that we 
table of contents completed in august the sale of common stock in this offering created an additional ownership change 
it was determined that we had an ownership change under section we believe that approximately million of the million federal losses will expire unused due to section limitations 
the maximum annual limitation under section is approximately million for the first five years and then decreases to million for the remaining fifteen years 
the limitation could be further restricted if ownership changes occur in future years 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is limited  future income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  which could result in decreased net income 
we also have federal and state research and development credit carryovers of approximately million  which expire commencing in fiscal results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions of million in clinical expenses and million in manufacturing and device development expenses 
the savings in clinical expenses are directly related to conducting fewer studies during the fiscal year ended september  for example  our month safety extension trials for patients who completed the pivotal phase clinical trials of linjeta tm ended in february the savings in manufacturing and device development are the result of purchasing a reduced quantity of recombinant human insulin in the twelve months ended september  of million  as compared to the million of purchases made in the twelve months ended september  the decreases in clinical and manufacturing expenses were offset by increases of million in regulatory expense attributable to professional and consulting fees associated with filing our nda in december and our day safety update in april  million in personnel and share based compensation expenses  million in expenses related to further develop our earlier staged products  and million in professional fees  storage and other expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in share based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
because we must revalue options granted to non employees for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the share based compensation income for the year ended september  was thousand 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will decrease as we plan to conduct preclinical studies and phase clinical trials to study linjeta tm follow on and second generation rapid acting mealtime insulins or insulin analogs in order to determine our preferred development  clinical and regulatory program for our rapid acting insulin formulations 
over the longer term  however  we anticipate these expenses will increase as we advance a preferred formulation toward pivotal phase clinical trials 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of thousand  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to a decrease in personnel and employee share based compensation expenses of million offset by an increase of million in professional fees  million in non employee director share based compensation expense and other expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and non employee directors 
because we must revalue options granted to non employees for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the stock based compensation income for the year ended september  was thousand 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease over the next twelve months as we focus our efforts to conduct preclinical and phase clinical trials to study linjeta tm follow on and second generation rapid acting mealtime insulins or insulin analogs 
over the longer term  however  we anticipate these expenses will increase as we advance a preferred formulation toward pivotal phase clinical trials 
interest and other income 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was due to a lower cash balance and shifting our investments primarily into treasury securities 
the focus on preserving cash and investing in stable securities generated lower returns during the year ended september  interest expense 
for the years ended september  and  we had no interest expense 
adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability percentage of net loss adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability increased to million for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the september  charge represents an increase in fair value of our warrant liability determined by the monte carlo simulation method 
the monte carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical method used to generate a defined number of stock price paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of the range of our and our peer group s future expected stock prices and minimizes standard error 
these warrants will be revalued each reporting period 

table of contents net loss and net loss per share 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts net loss net loss per share net loss was million  or per share  for the year ended september  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to reduced clinical and manufacturing expenses as noted above 
we expect our losses to continue as we plan to conduct preclinical and phase clinical trials of several rapid acting insulin and insulin analog formulations prior to advancing a preferred rapid acting formulation by conducting phase or phase clinical trials 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue

year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in research and development costs related to our pivotal phase clinical trials for linjeta tm and a decrease of million in the costs of manufacturing clinical supplies 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million for the purchase of recombinant human insulin during the fiscal year in order to build commercial supply as per existing contractual commitments and an increase of million in professional fees for the preparation of the filing of our planned nda 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in share based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and million in share based compensation expense related to options granted to non employees 
general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to the following items a decrease of million in share based compensation charges for the non employee directors due to a change in vesting policy from immediate vesting to vesting pro rata over one year  a decrease of million in professional fees  a decrease of million in personnel expenses and a

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and cash flows as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products or other sources of revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated significant operating losses since we were incorporated in we initially funded our research and development operations through proceeds from our series a convertible preferred stock financing in and our mezzanine and series b convertible preferred stock financings in through december   we had received aggregate gross proceeds of million from these sales 
we received an aggregate of million from our initial public offering in may  our follow on offering in february and our registered direct offering in august at september   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  totaling approximately million 
we have invested our excess funds primarily in managed money funds with one major financial institution 
all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are categorized as cash equivalents 
we plan to continue to invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with our approved investment policy guidelines  which set forth our policy to hold investment securities to maturity

net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds from our follow on public offering 
in july  we entered into a supply agreement with nv organon  which will terminate in december  to purchase specified minimum quantities of recombinant human insulin 
our minimum purchase requirements for the next five consecutive quarters could total as much as million  depending on our regulatory plans for linjeta tm 
on august   we sold to two institutional investors an aggregate of  units that were immediately separated and we issued  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
the financing resulted in gross proceeds of million 
subsequently  on december   the exercise price of the warrants was re set to per share 
on february   we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share and received net proceeds from this offering  after deducting after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  of million 
certain of our stockholders sold  shares in the offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares from the selling stockholders 
funding requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least through the first quarter of fiscal year if the august warrants are exercised  we anticipate the cash runway to extend at least through the second quarter of fiscal year we have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
our existing capital resources are not sufficient to complete our clinical development program for linjeta tm 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current anticipated clinical trials 

table of contents our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to respond to the complete response letter regarding our nda for linjeta tm in a timely manner and the possibility that information we provide in response to the letter may not be sufficient for the approval of linjeta tm or another rapid acting insulin or insulin analog by the fda  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca and the degree to which we are able to clarify with the fda related regulatory requirements  our ability to conduct the additional pivotal clinical trials the fda requested in the complete response letter or other tests or analyses required by the fda to secure approval to commercialize linjeta tm  our ability to develop and commercialize formulations of linjeta tm or other rapid acting insulin or insulin analog formulations that may be associated with less injection site discomfort than the formulation that is the subject of the complete response letter we received from the fda  the progress  timing or success of our product candidates  particularly linjeta tm  and that of our research  development and clinical programs  including any resulting data analyses  the cost to develop an insulin pen for use with linjeta tm and a formulation of linjeta tm for use in insulin pumps  the costs of pre commercialization activities  if any  the costs associated with qualifying and obtaining regulatory approval of suppliers of insulin and manufacturers of our product candidates  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and the terms and success of the collaborations  including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from potential strategic collaborators  and our ability to accurately estimate anticipated operating losses  future revenues  capital requirements and our needs for additional financing 
we do not anticipate generating product revenue for the next few years 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several years 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
management may seek to meet all or some of our operating cash flow requirements through financing activities  such as private placements of our common stock  preferred stock offerings and offerings of debt and convertible debt instruments as well as through merger or acquisition opportunities 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement file no 
with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to which we registered an indeterminate number of shares of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and an indeterminate number of warrants and units with an aggregate initial offering price of up to  on august   we sold to two institutional investors an aggregate of  units that were immediately separated and we issued  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of 
the financing resulted in gross proceeds of million 
subsequently  on december   the exercise price of the warrants was re set to per share 
we may receive additional proceeds from the exercise of warrants in connection with the securities purchase agreement and related documents we entered into in august the exercise will be dependent 
table of contents upon whether the market price or our common stock exceeds the current exercise price of per share of common stock and the investors choose to exercise 
additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to reduce general and administrative expenses and delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs  which could possibly include a reduction in personnel 
we would also reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently or enter into corporate collaborations at a later stage of development 
in addition  any future equity funding will dilute the ownership of our equity investors 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements

participating securities in june the fasb issued asc earnings per share overall formerly financial statement position emerging issues task force  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities asc 
asc provides that securities and unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
upon adoption  a company is required to 
table of contents retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data including any amounts related to interim periods  summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform to the provisions of asc warrant liability given that the warrant holders will participate fully on any dividends or dividend equivalents  we determined that the warrants are participating securities and therefore are subject to asc these securities were excluded from the eps calculation since their inclusion would be anti dilutive 
share based compensation given that the holders of restricted stock unit awards rsus will only receive dividends or dividend equivalents on rsus that have vested prior to the company declaring dividends as well as forfeiting their rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents on any unvested portion  we determined that the rsus are non participating securities and therefore are not subject to asc recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires new disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
the new guidance requires a reporting entity to disclose significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  to describe the reasons for the transfers and to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs
