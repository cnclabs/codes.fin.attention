critical accounting policies the financial accounting standards board fasb recognized the complexity of its standard setting process and embarked on a revised process in that culminated in the release on july  of the fasb accounting standards codification tm the fasb asc  which is also sometimes referred to as the codification or the asc 
the codification does not change how the company accounts for its transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
to the company  this means instead of following the rules in statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  we will follow the guidance in asc  stock compensation 
references to generally accepted accounting principles gaap issued by the fasb  within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report are to the codification 
the fasb finalized the codification effective for periods ending on or after september  prior fasb standards like sfas no 
r  share based payment  are no longer being issued by the fasb 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information 
our critical accounting polices include the following inventories inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates average cost or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand  if necessary 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfers and the customer assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product and revenues are recognized accordingly 
sales returns  rebates and allowances sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns  rebates and allowances based on historical experience 
since our return policy is only days and our products are not generally susceptible to external factors such as technological obsolescence or significant changes in demand  we are able to make a reasonable estimate for returns 
we offer end user product specific and sales volume rebates to select distributors 
our rebates are based on actual sales and accrued monthly 
stock based compensation alpha pro tech  ltd 
alpha pro tech or the company adopted fasb asc  stock compensation  asc and formerly referred to as sfas no 
r  effective january   using the modified prospective application method 
asc requires companies to record compensation expense for the value of all outstanding and unvested share based payments  including employee stock options and similar awards 
the fair values of stock option grants are determined using the black scholes merton option pricing model and are based on the following assumptions expected stock price volatility based on historical and management s expectations of future volatility  risk free interest rates from published sources  years to maturity based on historical data and no dividend yield  as management currently does not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the black scholes merton option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  the option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their fair value

we accomplish this by developing  manufacturing and marketing a line of high value  disposable protective apparel and infection control products for the cleanroom  industrial  pharmaceutical  medical and dental markets

previously  the line of medical bed pads and pet beds were reported as a separate segment under the name of extended care 
because management is now looking at the extended care segment in conjunction with the infection control segment  and since the majority of the former extended care segment revenue is now generated from the medical bed pads  as of the first quarter of  these products have been consolidated into the infection control segment 
all financial information has been updated to reflect the updated segmentation 
our target markets include pharmaceutical manufacturing  bio pharmaceutical manufacturing and medical device manufacturing  lab animal research  high technology electronics manufacturing which includes the semi conductor market  medical and dental distributors  pet distributors  and construction  building supply and roofing distributors
