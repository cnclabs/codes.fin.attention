the company moody s is a provider of i credit ratings  ii credit and economic related research  data and analytical tools  iii risk management software and iv quantitative credit risk measures  credit portfolio management solutions and training services 
moody s operates in two reportable segments mis and ma 
mis  the credit rating agency  publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 
revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors 
the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets 
within its rd a business  ma distributes investor oriented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process  including in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies and commentary on topical credit related events 
the rd a business also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores 
within its rms business  ma provides both economic and regulatory capital risk management software solutions 
within its professional services business it provides quantitative credit risk measures  credit portfolio management solutions and training services 
beginning in january  moody s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august as a result of the reorganization  the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines were realigned 
all of moody s other non rating commercial activities are represented in the ma segment 
as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs 
sovereign and sub sovereign ratings  which were previously part of financial institutions  infrastructure utilities ratings  which were previously part of corporate finance  and project finance  which was previously part of structured finance  were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public  project and infrastructure finance 
in addition  real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business 
furthermore  in august the global managed investments ratings group  previously part of the structured finance business  was combined with the financial institutions business 
in within ma  various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions  software and professional services businesses 
the subscriptions business included credit and economic research  data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis  the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk  securities pricing and valuation software products  and the professional services business included advisory services associated with risk modeling  credit scorecard development  and other specialized analytical projects  as well as credit training and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis 
subscription services are typically sold for an initial month term  with renewal features for subsequent annual periods 
in  the aforementioned ma businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the ma segment at december  pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed research data and analytics and the software business was renamed risk management software 
the revised groupings classify certain subscription based risk management software revenue and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined rms business 
critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring liabilities  pension and other post retirement benefits  utbs and stock based compensation 
actual moody s k 
table of contents results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings  mis uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between the initial assignment of ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where mis does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer 
these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties  but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods 
in such cases  mis defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 
the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors  including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers 
the monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities 
currently  the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years 
at december   and  deferred revenue included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to such monitoring fees 
additionally  in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities  derivatives  international residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities  issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront 
these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods  ranging from three to years  which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities at december  at december   and  deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december   and  accounts receivable included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
revenue earned within the ma segment is recognized as follows subscription based revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period which is typically for an initial month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods  beginning upon delivery of the initial product  software revenue is recognized at time of delivery which is considered to have occurred upon transfer of the product master or first copy 
if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service  revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs  professional service revenue is generally recognized at the time services are performed 
certain revenue arrangements within the ma segment include multiple elements such as software licenses  maintenance  subscription fees and professional services 
in these types of arrangements  the fee is allocated to the various products or services based on objective measurements of fair value  that is  generally the price charged when sold separately or vendor specific objective evidence 
accounts receivable allowance moody s records provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue  based on historical experience and current conditions 
such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
additionally  estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
billing adjustments and uncollectible account write offs are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from an industry and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its analysis  moody s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in amounts that are greater or less than estimates 
each quarter  the company revises its provision rates for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate accounts receivable allowance 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this md a  commencing on page is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where moody s k 
table of contents deemed appropriate 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may  in the future  adjust its associated liabilities 
based on its review of the latest information available  and subject to the contingencies described in item md a contingencies  the ultimate monetary liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated financial position  although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 
for the years ended december   and  the provision for income taxes reflected credits of million  million and million  respectively  due to changes in the company s liabilities for legacy tax exposures that were assumed by moody s in connection with its separation from old d b in october these tax matters are more fully described under the caption legacy tax matters within item  md a 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  annually as of november th or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with asc topic these impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
during there was a change in the reporting unit structure of ma to reflect the realignment under which the ma segment is currently managed 
accordingly  it was determined that ma had three reporting units within its segment rd a  rms and training 
the rd a reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor oriented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process  in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies  economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools 
the rms reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance 
the training reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training 
as such  at the date of the impairment test  the company had four primary reporting units mis  which encompasses the company s ratings operations and the aforementioned three reporting units within ma 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level by asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  the company must perform a second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived acquired intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable 
however  as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  actual future results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 
as a result of the reporting structure realignment in the ma segment described above  the company reassigned the assets and liabilities of the ma segment to each of its reporting units 
goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach  other assets and liabilities  including applicable corporate assets  are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 
based on the result of the above test  the company does not believe any of its reporting units are at risk of failing step of the impairment test as the fair value for all reporting units is well in excess of the respective reporting unit s carrying value 
moody s k 
table of contents the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic  assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of november  step one sensitivity analysis deficit caused by a hypothetical reduction to fair value goodwill mis rd a rms training totals the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the results of the dcf are evaluated against comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples in order to assess the reasonableness of the dcf fair values 
the dcf analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value  including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit  which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  terminal values  weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
moody s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 
the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis  or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 
the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment wacc the wacc is the rate to discount each reporting unit s estimated future cash flows 
the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity 
the cost of equity is based on a risk free interest rate  an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit s cash flows 
the cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the company s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc 
the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested 
the wacc for all reporting units ranged from to in differences in the wacc used between reporting units is due primarily to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units 
a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units 
an increase in the wacc of for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic future cash flow assumptions the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit 
cash flows for each of the next five years beginning in were estimated based on annual revenue growth rates ranging from to 
the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue from financial service customers based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets which began in the second half of beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates 
a sensitivity analysis of the growth rates was performed on all reporting units 
a decrease in the growth rates used in the discounted cash flow calculation of for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic however  there is a greater probability of potential goodwill impairment in the rms and training reporting units if estimated growth rates are not met due to the lower percentage by which the fair value of these reporting units exceeds the carrying value 
amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the difficult market and economic conditions in resulted in lower than anticipated revenue for the rms and training reporting units compared to forecasted results causing the company to test the intangible assets within these reporting units for impairment at november  this test was performed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of each asset group that contained the aforementioned intangible assets to the carrying amount of the asset group 
the undiscounted cash flows were sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset group and resulted in an excess of and for the rms and training reporting units  respectively

table of contents restructuring the company has engaged in restructuring actions  which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs  contract termination costs and asset impairments 
if the actual amounts differ from these estimates  the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted 
for both the restructuring plan and the restructuring plan  there have not been any significant differences between original estimates and actual amounts recorded upon completion of both plans 
for a full description of moody s restructuring actions  refer to the results of operations section below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other post retirement benefits the expenses  assets and liabilities that moody s reports for its pension and other post retirement benefit plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets  based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments future healthcare cost trends  based on historical market data  near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve 
the cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 
moody s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s post retirement plans 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise 
the company amortizes  as a component of annual pension expense  total outstanding gain or loss over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain loss exceeds of the greater of the beginning of year projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets 
for moody s post retirement plans  the total losses as of december  that have not been recognized in annual expense are million  and moody s expects to recognize net periodic pension expense of million in for the amortization of actuarial losses 
for moody s funded pension plan  the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense 
the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization 
as of december   the company has an unrecognized asset loss of million  of which million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of expense 
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody s operating income 
these effects have been calculated using the company s current projections of expenses  assets and liabilities related to moody s post retirement plans  which could change as updated data becomes available 
assumption used for estimated impact on operating income decrease increase discount rate weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets discount rates of and are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect projected expenses 
based on current projections  the company estimates that expenses related to post retirement plans will be million in compared with million in the expected expense increase in reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to assumption changes  such as higher cash balance interest crediting rate and lower discount rates  as well as higher amortization of actuarial losses

table of contents stock based compensation the company records compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company  which is limited 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 
an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in dollars in millions assumption used for grants increase in assumption estimated impact on operating income in increase decrease average expected dividend yield average expected share price volatility expected option holding period years year income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
the company s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as inter company transactions 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic therefore  income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes  and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 
moody s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters 
the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps 
the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties  if any  as part of other non operating expenses 
for utp s  asc topic requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits  and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company s operating results or financial condition 
for certain of its foreign subsidiaries  the company has deemed a portion of the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested within its foreign operations 
accordingly  the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings 
a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability for the company which may be material to moody s future reported results  financial position and cash flows 
other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated dividend distributions from non us subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition

in addition  real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business 
furthermore  in august the global managed investments ratings group  previously part of the structured finance business  was combined with the financial institutions business 
the mis segment now consists of four lines of business structured finance  corporate finance  financial institutions and public  project and infrastructure finance that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 
as part of the reorganization  various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions  software and professional services businesses within ma 
the subscriptions business included credit and economic research  data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis for an initial month term  with renewal features for subsequent annual periods  the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk  securities pricing and valuation software products  and the professional services business included credit training associated with risk modeling  credit scorecard development  and other specialized analytical projects  as well as credit and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis

the company has adopted this new accounting standard as of december  and has presented the required disclosures in the prescribed format in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this new standard only affected the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements and did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
during the period ending september   the company adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles which only affected the specific references to gaap literature in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this new standard eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
the company will adopt this new accounting standard as of january  and does not expect the implementation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the company has elected to early adopt asu on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after january  if applied in the same manner to the year ended december   asu would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its mis and ma segments in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition 
the adoption of asu is also not expected to have a significant effect on the company s net revenue in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on its current pricing strategies 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new standard requires disclosure regarding transfers in and out of level and level classifications within the fair value hierarchy as well as requiring further detail of activity within the level category of the fair value hierarchy 
the new standard also requires disclosures regarding the fair value for each class of assets and liabilities  which is a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in a company s balance sheet 
additionally  the standard will require further disclosures surrounding inputs and valuation techniques used in fair value measurements 
the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years

as additional information becomes moody s k 
table of contents available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly 
for income tax matters  the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
the company cannot predict the ultimate impact that any of the legislative  regulatory  enforcement or litigation matters may have on how its business is conducted and thus its competitive position  financial position or results of operations 
based on its review of the latest information available  in the opinion of management  the ultimate monetary liability of the company for the pending matters referred to above other than the legacy tax matters that are discussed below is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 
legacy tax matters moody s continues to have exposure to potential liabilities arising from legacy tax matters 
as of december   moody s has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling million 
this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new d b arising from the distribution agreement 
it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company  which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody s future reported results  financial position and cash flows 
the following summary of the relationships among moody s  new d b and their predecessor entities is important in understanding our exposure to the legacy tax matters 
in november  the dun bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun bradstreet corporation  acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation 
in june  the dun bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old d b and rh donnelley corporation 
during  cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated and nielsen media research  inc in september  old d b separated into two separate public companies new d b and moody s 
old d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
old d b and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes  penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs determinations on certain tax matters  and certain other potential tax liabilities  all as described in such agreements 
further  in connection with the distribution and pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  new d b and moody s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to these legacy tax matters 
settlement agreements were executed with the irs in regarding the legacy tax matters for the years and these settlements represent substantially all of the total potential liability to the irs  including penalties 
as of december   the company continues to carry a liability of million for the remaining potential exposure 
in addition  with respect to these settlement agreements  moody s and new d b believe that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties 
moody s and new d b paid these amounts to the irs on their behalf  and attempted to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr 
as a result  moody s and new d b commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr in connection with the matter 
this matter was resolved during the third quarter of in favor of moody s and new d b  resulting in ims health and nmr having paid a total of million to moody s 
in the second quarter of  moody s and new d b reached a settlement with ims health and nmr with respect to the matter  resulting in million of cash proceeds paid to moody s of which million represents interest and million is a reduction of tax expense 
amortization expense deductions this legacy tax matter  which was affected by developments in june and as further described below  involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old d b since irs audits of old d b s and new d b s tax returns for the years through concluded in june without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions  or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership transaction 
these audits resulted in the irs issuing the notices for other tax issues for the years aggregating million in tax and penalties  plus statutory interest of approximately million  which should be apportioned among moody s  new d b  ims health and nmr pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements 
moody s share of this assessment was million including interest  net of tax 
in november  the irs assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment  together with interest 
the company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the irs s actions and is evaluating its alternatives to recover these amounts 
the absence of any tax deficiencies in the notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years through  moody s k 
table of contents combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for through  for issues not assessed  resulted in moody s recording an earnings benefit of million in the second quarter of this is comprised of two components  as follows i a reversal of a tax liability of million related to the period from through the distribution date  reducing the provision for income taxes  and ii a reduction of accrued interest expense of million million  net of tax and an increase in other non operating income of million  relating to amounts due to new d b 
in june  the statute of limitations for new d b relating to the tax year expired 
as a result  in the second quarter of  moody s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of million million  net of tax and an increase in other non operating income of million  relating to amounts due to new d b 
as of december   moody s carries a liability of million with respect to this matter 
on the distribution date  new d b paid moody s million for of certain anticipated future tax benefits of new d b through it is possible that irs audits of new d b for tax years after could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction 
in the event that these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new d b  or there is an audit adjustment  moody s would be required  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  to repay to new d b an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that new d b incurs 
as of december   moody s liability with respect to this matter totaled million 
in march  new d b and moody s each deposited million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the through tax years 
in july  new d b and moody s commenced procedures to recover approximately million of these deposits million for new d b and million for moody s  which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the notices 
as noted above  in november the irs used million of moody s portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest 
additionally  in the first quarter of the irs returned to moody s million in connection with this matter  which includes million of interest 
in july  the irs paid moody s the remaining million balance of the original deposit  and in september the irs paid moody s million of interest on that balance
