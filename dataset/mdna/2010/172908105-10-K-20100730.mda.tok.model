results of operation the economic downturn that occurred in fiscal continued throughout most of our fiscal the us economy  which lost millions of jobs in our fiscal  continued to lose jobs through the first three quarters of our fiscal these job losses directly affected our business as many of our products and services are dependent on customer employee levels 
we were encouraged  though  that the rate of us job loss lessened as we progressed through the first three quarters of fiscal  and us employment levels slightly increased in our fourth fiscal quarter 
as this stabilization occurred in the general us economic environment  our internal growth rate improved

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal the economic environment in fiscal presented challenges not experienced in decades 
the financial crisis which began in september   caused many of our customers to immediately reduce spending 
as the economic turmoil continued  we saw our customers make dramatic reductions in spending 
significant job losses in north america followed the financial crisis as these economies lost millions of jobs from october through may the suddenness and severity of the economic downturn required us to react quickly to reduce our cost structure 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we closed two manufacturing plants in kentucky  initiated hiring and wage freezes in many parts of the organization  eliminated many overhead positions and reduced discretionary and capital spending 
these initiatives resulted in a reduction to selling and administrative expenses of approximately million when comparing the last six months of fiscal to the first six months of fiscal in addition to the actions described above  we initiated restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce excess capacity and further reduce our cost structure 
these activities included closing or converting to branches of our rental processing plants and reducing our workforce by  employees 
these restructuring activities were substantially completed in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges of million in long lived asset impairment costs  million in employee termination costs and million in other exit costs for a total of million that will be incurred as a result of this restructuring
