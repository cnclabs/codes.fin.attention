overview the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them  the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology  all of which are outside of our control 
as a result  our revenue and gross margins  to the extent affected by increases or decreases in volume  could fluctuate from year to year and period to period 
the industry experienced a downturn beginning in the second half of which extended through  although signs of improvement began during the fourth quarter of our gross margins are also affected by the introduction of new products 
we typically become more efficient in manufacturing products as they mature 
our expense base is largely fixed and does not vary significantly with changes in volume 
therefore  we could experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenue as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the sizable expense of building  upgrading or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is increasingly causing semiconductor companies to contract with foundries to manufacture their semiconductors 
in addition  consolidation and partnering within the semiconductor manufacturing industry is increasing 
we expect these trends to continue to reduce the number of our potential customers 
this growing concentration of axcelis customers may increase competitive pricing as higher percentages of our total revenue are tied to the buying decisions of a particular customer or a small number of customers 
in   and  we incurred net losses 
beginning in  most customers shifted from multi wafer tools to single wafer tools for high current ion implant applications 
because we were late to market with a single wafer high current product  we experienced a significant loss of market share 
we introduced our single wafer optima hd for high current applications product in and have gained traction with this tool at a number of customers 
although we believe that we have competitive products  challenging market conditions have severely limited our ability to increase sales and market share 
additionally  in concert with the market uncertainty resulting from the recent credit crisis  we believe that the economic downturn which is characterized by higher unemployment  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment and lower consumer spending  has severely impacted many technology manufacturers and has significantly lowered the demand for our products 
the company believes that a combination of these factors accounts for the difference between our stock trading price and our book value 
as described in business sale of investment in sen  on march   the company sold all of the company s common shares in sen to shi  in exchange for a cash payment of billion yen  which resulted in proceeds of approximately million before advisor fees and other expenses of million 
the sale price was determined through an arm s length negotiation 
this transaction terminated all prior agreements among the three parties relating to the sen joint venture 
in addition  the arbitration with sen initiated by axcelis in tokyo  japan was dismissed 
in connection with the sale of its investment in sen  on march   the company and sen entered into a cross license agreement pursuant to which the parties may use certain technical information on a non exclusive  perpetual  royalty free  worldwide basis  provided that the company and sen received sole exclusive licenses for years in the us and japan  respectively 
the sale of the company s investment in sen resulted in a gain of approximately million 
this gain includes net proceeds of million after payment of advisor fees and other costs of million and cumulative foreign translation gain of million  previously recorded in other comprehensive income  reduced by the carrying value of the investment on the date of sale of million 
the gain from sale of the company s investment in sen is recorded in other income 
a portion of the proceeds of the sale were used to pay off  in full  the amounts due to the holder of the company s convertible senior subordinated notes 
axcelis liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these factors are based on normal operations of the business  including sale of optima products in inventory  and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies  including the availability of credit  and the state of the semiconductor equipment industry 
although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  based on our current market  revenue and expense forecast we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements in the short and long term 
operating results for the years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future interim periods or years as a whole 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable  inventory and warranty obligations 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described below  we consider a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  payment history  customer creditworthiness and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance  we may have to revise our revenue recognition policy  which could delay the timing of revenue recognition 
axcelis revenue transactions include sales of products under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to each element  except systems  based upon its estimated fair market value 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is calculated on a residual method 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements  with the residual amount being allocated to product revenue 
the value of the undelivered elements includes a the greater of i the fair value of the installation or ii the portion of the sales price that will not be received until the installation is completed the retention plus b the fair value of all other undelivered elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed  including labor  which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation at hourly rates  and material components 
the fair value of all other undelivered elements is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
product revenue for products which have demonstrated market acceptance legacy products  is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  prices are contractually fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue from installation services is recognized at the time formal acceptance is received from the customer or  for certain customers  when both the formal acceptance and retention payment have been received 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
we generally recognize systems revenue for products which have demonstrated market acceptance legacy products  at the time of shipment because the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory 
the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer s specifications  as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis  which may be the axcelis standard specification 
to ensure that the customer s specifications are satisfied  many customers request that new systems be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer s production environment and the customer s criteria are confirmed to have been met 
customers of mature products generally do not require pre shipment testing 
we believe the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote 
should an installation not be completed successfully  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
for initial shipments of systems with new technologies or in the small number of instances where axcelis is unsure of meeting the customer s specifications or obtaining customer acceptance upon shipment of the system  axcelis will defer the recognition of systems revenue and related costs until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts  or based on parts usage  where appropriate 
revenue related to service hours is recognized when the services are performed 
royalty revenue is primarily earned under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
royalty revenue is recorded at the time sen notifies the company that royalties have been earned 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets might not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a sustained market capitalization below book value  as well as a significant decline in our business that led us to revise our short term financial forecasts 
as a result  we recorded a total intangible and long lived asset impairment charge at december  of million 
this charge consisted of intangibles of million  certain other assets of million and property  plant and equipment of million 
during  we continued to experience events and circumstances which indicated that a further impairment of long lived assets may have occurred 
the significant decline in our stock price continued through most of  and we continued to maintain a market capitalization significantly below book value 
in addition  the estimated future total market for our products  which was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter of  showed only modest signs of recovery as of december  however  recent industry market forecasts anticipate greater recovery in accordingly  as of december   we performed an analysis comparing undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the long lived assets to the carrying amounts of those assets 
the estimates of future operating results and cash flows are derived from our updated long term financial forecast 
this updated long term forecast represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable  based primarily on current product performance and customer acceptance 
this forecast relies primarily on market assumptions and market share we expect to achieve 
as of december   our analysis indicated that the carrying amounts for long lived assets are expected to be recovered 
as such  we did not record an impairment charge for the year ended december  however  actual performance could be materially different from our current forecasts  which could impact future estimates of undiscounted cash flows and may result in the impairment of the carrying amount of the long lived assets in the future 
this could be caused by strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material adverse change in our relationships with significant customers 
accordingly we will continue to perform this analysis no less than quarterly for the foreseeable future 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management s assumptions of materials usage  based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts or product demand and pricing assumptions  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  pricing  or technical developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that estimates are too optimistic and determine that inventory needs to be written down  the company will recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
product warranty we offer a one to three year product warranty  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
for all systems sold  we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of non standard warranty 
costs for non standard warranty are expensed as incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue product service royalties  primarily from sen total revenue cost of revenue product services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill impairment of intangibles and long lived assets amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense gain on sale of sen equity income loss of sen interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue revenue declined significantly in compared to due to the continuing depressed semiconductor equipment market 
based on current industry projections we expect revenue  from both system sales and our aftermarket business  to improve in product product revenue  which includes systems sales  sales of spare parts and product upgrades  was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue in the decline in product revenue in and was attributable to a weakening semiconductor market and a related decrease in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
in addition  a decrease in mm manufacturing capacity a portion of which relates to the overall decline in the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased revenue from system sales by million for approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decline was mainly due to the decrease in overall systems revenue in service service revenue  which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on site service personnel  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue  for the decline was due to a continuing decline in overall market conditions and low capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities 
although service revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems  it can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the need for our services 
royalties royalty revenue was million or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for royalties were earned primarily under our prior license agreement with sen 
as a result of the sale of our investment in sen  sen has had no further obligation to pay royalties to us since march  ion implant included in total revenue of million in is revenue from sales of ion implantation products and service of million  or of total revenue  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the decline was due to the factors discussed above 
annual revenue from the sale of ion implantation products and service typically averages from to of total revenue 
aftermarket the company s product revenue includes sales of spare parts and product upgrades as well as complete systems 
we refer to the business of selling spare parts and product upgrades  combined with the sale of maintenance labor and service contracts and service hours  as the aftermarket business 
included in total revenue of million in is revenue from our aftermarket business of million  compared to million for aftermarket revenue generally increases with expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service 
after hitting bottom in the first quarter of  industry utilization has increased every quarter since then 
this has resulted in successive improvements in aftermarket revenue each quarter  a trend that is expected to continue into gross profit product gross profit from product revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  the decrease resulted from significantly lower systems sales volume during the twelve months ended december   and the related under absorption of manufacturing overhead which reduced gross margins by 
this was offset by a increase in gross margin resulting from the favorable impact of an increased mix of parts and upgrade revenue at higher margins and attributable to a lower provision for excess inventory 
service gross profit from service revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in gross profit is attributable to significantly lower revenue 
operating expenses in response to continuing weak market conditions in the company took several actions  including reduction in headcount  to reduce operating expenses 
the aggregate of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense reduction in compared to was million 
research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to substantial completion of optima and integra platform development in  which resulted in decreased payroll costs million  decreased professional fee expenses million  decreased project material costs million  decreased development asset amortization and depreciation costs million and decreased other miscellaneous expenses million 
research and development expense was attributable to the following activities for for new product development  for improvement of existing products  and for product testing 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was driven primarily by decreased payroll costs million  decreased professional services million  decreased supplies and marketing costs million  decreased travel costs million  decreased freight costs million and decreased other miscellaneous costs million 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or compared with million in the decrease was driven primarily by decreased payroll costs of million  decreased professional fee expenses million decreased amortization costs million  and a decrease in other miscellaneous costs million 
impairment of intangibles and long lived assets during the fourth quarter of  the significant decline in our stock price experienced at the end of the third quarter continued through the end of the fourth quarter and beyond  resulting in a sustained market capitalization well below book value 
during we continued to experience events and circumstances which indicated that a further impairment of long lived assets may have occurred 
the significant decline in our stock price continued through  and we continued to maintain a market capitalization significantly below book value 
in addition  the estimated future total market for our products  which was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter of  while showing signs of modest recovery which is expected to continue into is still less than historical levels 
accordingly  as of december   we performed an analysis comparing undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the long lived assets to the carrying amounts of those assets 
the estimates of future operating results and cash flows are derived from our updated long term financial forecast 
this updated long term forecast represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable  based primarily on current product performance and customer acceptance 
this forecast relies primarily on market assumptions and market share we expect to achieve 
as of december   our analysis indicated that the carrying amounts for long lived assets are expected to be recovered 
as such we did not record an impairment charge for the year ended december  however  actual performance could be materially different from our current forecasts  which could impact future estimates of undiscounted cash flows and may result in the impairment of the carrying amount of the long lived assets in the future 
this could be caused by strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material adverse change in our relationships with significant customers 
accordingly we will continue to perform this analysis no less than quarterly for the foreseeable future 
as a result of our review of the recoverability of intangibles and long lived assets  at december   we recorded an impairment charge of million consisting of the entire net book value of intangible assets of million  certain other assets of million  and property  plant and equipment of million 
restructuring during the year ended december   we implemented a reduction in force to further reduce costs to mitigate deteriorating industry fundamentals 
this reduction in force resulted in a total charge to expense of approximately million related to separation and outplacement costs for the year ended december   offset by a reversal of million of accrued compensation expense related to terminated employees 
a charge to expense of million was recorded in the year ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our restructuring 
changes in our restructuring liability  included in amounts reported as other current liabilities  are as follows severance in thousands balance at december  severance and related costs cash payments balance at december  other income expense equity loss attributable to sen was million for the year ended december  this is compared to equity loss attributable to sen of million for the year ended december  as a result of the sale of our investment in sen  subsequent to march   the company no longer records equity income or loss from sen 
interest income of million for the year ended december   primarily relates to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest income decreased by million from the year ended december   due primarily to lower average cash balances 
interest expense decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease is due to the payment in full of the convertible senior subordinated notes on march  income taxes we incur income tax expense relating principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  we do not currently pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions and we do not recognize the tax benefit for such losses as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue product product revenue  which includes systems sales  sales of spare parts and product upgrades  was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue in the decline in product revenue in was mainly attributable to a weakening semiconductor market and a related decrease in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
product revenue in and was also impacted by our loss of high current market share  as discussed above 
in addition  a decrease in mm manufacturing capacity a portion of which relates to the overall decline in the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased revenue from system sales by million for approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decline was mainly due to the decrease in overall systems revenue in and the recognition of million of revenue deferred in related to the rollout of the optima hd product line 
service service revenue  which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on site service personnel  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue  for although service revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems  it can fluctuate period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the need for equipment service 
royalties royalty revenue was million or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for royalties are earned primarily under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
changes are mainly attributable to fluctuations in sen sales volume based on demand for equipment by japanese semiconductor manufacturers and the timing of shipments in japan 
as a result of the sale of the our investment in sen subsequent to march  sen has had no further obligation to pay royalties to us 
ion implant revenue from sales of ion implantation products and service accounted for million  or of total revenue in  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the decline was due to the factors discussed above 
annual revenue from the sale of ion implantation products and service typically averages from to of total revenue 
aftermarket the company s product revenue includes sales of spare parts and product upgrades as well as complete systems 
we refer to the business of selling spare parts and product upgrades  combined with the sale of maintenance labor and service contracts and service hours as the aftermarket business 
the revenue from our aftermarket business was million for  compared to million for aftermarket revenue generally increases with expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service 
the estimated future total available market for our products  as published by independent third party industry analysts  was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter and we experienced a decline as compared to aftermarket revenue in the third quarter of  in our aftermarket business  reflecting significant declines in manufacturers capacity utilization 
gross profit product gross profit from product revenue was for  compared to for  a decrease of 
approximately of the decrease pertains to an additional reserve of million for excess inventory 
the remaining decrease is attributable to the significantly lower system sales volume during the year 
these amounts were offset by the favorable impact of an increased mix of parts and upgrade revenue at higher margins 
service gross profit from service revenue was for  compared to for the increase in gross profit is attributable to service pricing increases enacted during the first quarter of driving a higher mix of profitable service support agreements and lower expenses against fixed price support contracts 
research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to completion of optima and integra platform development  which resulted in decreased professional fee expenses million  decreased payroll costs million and decreased project material costs million  offset by increased development asset amortization and depreciation costs million 
research and development expense was attributable to the following activities for for new product development  for improvement of existing products  and for product testing 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was driven primarily by decreased payroll costs million  decreased professional services million  decreased commissions expenses million  decreased travel costs million  decreased marketing communications costs million and decreased training and supplies costs million  offset by increased costs related to evaluation system support for our optima platform million 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million  compared with million in the increase was driven primarily by increased variable compensation costs of million and increased professional fee expenses million offset by lower payroll costs of million  lower stock compensation costs million and lower travel costs million 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets during the three month period ended september   we elected to discontinue future development of the rtp and curing product lines 
based on that business decision  the forecast of future cash flows was revised and  as such  in september a goodwill impairment loss of million was recorded 
our annual test was performed during the fourth quarter of during this period  the significant decline in our stock price experienced at the end of the third quarter continued through the end of the fourth quarter and beyond  resulting in a sustained market capitalization well below book value 
in addition  the estimated future total available market for our products  as published by independent third party industry analysts  was significantly revised downward in the fourth quarter and we experienced a decline as compared to aftermarket revenue in the third quarter of  in our aftermarket business  reflecting significant declines in manufacturers capacity utilization 
this fourth quarter contraction in the industry led us to revise our short term and long term financial forecast based on the result of our impairment assessment of goodwill  we determined that the carrying value of our cleaning and curing product line exceeded its estimated fair value 
therefore  we performed the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied value of goodwill 
specifically  we allocated the estimated fair value of our cleaning and curing product line as determined in the first step to recognized and unrecognized net assets  including allocations to intangible assets such as developed technologies  in process research and development  customer relationships and trade names 
the result of our analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to goodwill and accordingly  we wrote off the entire book value of goodwill of million as of december  based on the same factors  we also reviewed the recoverability of intangibles and long lived assets  and  at december   we recorded an impairment charge of million consisting of the entire net book value of intangible assets of million  certain other assets of million  and property  plant and equipment of million 
there was no impairment charge related to intangibles or long lived assets in restructuring in may and october of  we implemented a reduction in force to further reduce costs to mitigate deteriorating industry fundamentals 
these reductions in force resulted in restructuring charges to expense of million and million respectively for separation and outplacement costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our restructuring 
changes in our restructuring liability  included in amounts reported as other current liabilities  are as follows severance in thousands balance at december  severance and related costs cash payments balance at december  other income expense equity loss attributable to sen was million for this is compared to equity income attributable to sen of million for  and was due to changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market  and the timing of shipments in japan 
interest income of million for  primarily relates to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest income decreased by million from  due primarily to lower average cash balances 
interest expense of million in  an increase of million from  relates primarily to the then outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes which had an effective yield to maturity of 
the increase in interest expense in relates to the accretion of the premium due at maturity 
income taxes credits we incur income tax expense relating principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  we do not currently pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions and we do not recognize the tax benefit for such losses as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures for are projected to be less than million 
future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of expansion of our business and our ability to generate cash to fund them 
we have outstanding standby letters of credit  bank guarantees and surety bonds in the amount of million to support certain operating lease obligations  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe  of which million at december  was supported by cash pledged as collateral 
the pledged cash is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following represents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter purchase order commitments operating leases amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total thereafter standby letters of credit bank guarantees surety bonds we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  our liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these relate specifically to the operations of our business  for example  the rate of sale of optima inventory  and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies  including the availability of credit  and the condition of the overall semiconductor equipment industry 
on march   pursuant to the share purchase agreement with shi and sen  we sold all of our common shares in sen to shi for net proceeds of million 
we used million of that amount to pay in full our outstanding obligations on our convertible senior subordinated notes 
we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax effect of which aggregate million at december  these carryforwards  which expire principally between and  are available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
the sale of our investment in sen generated taxable income which we will off set with existing net operating loss carry forwards 
during  we experienced negative cash flows from operations 
cash used for operations in was predominately driven by the net loss from operations attributable to the depressed semiconductor equipment market and the resultant decline in revenue  offset by a reduction in working capital 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million at december  the million increase in cash and cash equivalents is mainly attributable to the net proceeds of the sale of our interest in sen corporation  less cash used by operations 
our plan includes improvement in revenue and cash flow and reduction of working capital as compared to on march   we amended our existing revolving credit facility with a bank 
the amended agreement provides for borrowings up to the lesser of million or specified percentages of the amounts of qualifying accounts receivable and inventory 
the facility has certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain minimum levels of operating results and liquidity 
based on current forecasts we believe we will be in compliance with the financial covenants throughout borrowings made under the facility will bear interest at the greater of or the bank s prime rate plus 
the agreement will terminate on march  we believe that based on our current market  revenue and expense forecasts  our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements 
our forecast reflects revenue and gross margins consistent with our understanding of customer plans  the improving market conditions currently forecasted by the industry  and increasing capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which has had a positive impact on our aftermarket business for the past several quarters 
forecasted operating expense levels reflect those in effect at the end of should the market recovery in not proceed in accordance with industry forecasts and our expectations and revenue remain at levels  we believe we can control spending levels to provide sufficient liquidity to support operations through however  the absence of a market recovery in would likely have a material effect on our liquidity entering recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued guidance on how companies should assess subsequent events 
this guidance is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance requires the company to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual financial periods after june  no significant events other than the amendment to the credit facility as disclosed in note have occurred through march  the date of issuance of this form k 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standard codification the codification 
this statement establishes the codification as the source of authorative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
this statement is effective for periods ending september  the adoption of the codification had no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
in september  the fasb issued a new accounting standard to provide guidance on revenue recognition criteria for multiple element arrangements 
the new accounting standard modifies the criteria used to separate elements in a multiple element arrangement by introducing the concept of best estimate of selling price  establishing a hierarchy of evidence for determining selling price fair value  requiring the use of relative selling price method and prohibiting the use of the residual method to allocate arrangement consideration among units of accounting 
the new accounting standard also expands the disclosure requirements for all multiple element arrangements and is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  january  for a calendar year end entity 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity axcelis exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists entirely of cash equivalents at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk
