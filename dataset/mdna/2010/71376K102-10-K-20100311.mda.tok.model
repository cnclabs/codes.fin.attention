item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pt s annual operating performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere herein  as well as the risk factors described in item a of this form k 
pt s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors  which are beyond pt s control 
these risks and uncertainties include  among other factors  business and economic conditions  rapid technological changes accompanied by frequent new product introductions  competitive pressures  dependence on key customers  inability to gauge order flows from customers  fluctuations in quarterly and annual results  the reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers  limitations of pt s manufacturing capacity and arrangements  the protection of pt s proprietary technology  the effects of pending or threatened litigation  the dependence on key personnel  changes in critical accounting estimates  potential impairments related to goodwill and investments  foreign regulations  and potential material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  during weak or uncertain economic periods  customers visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of their orders 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of pt s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of pt s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  estimates and assumptions are required to be made that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company believes that given the current facts and circumstances  these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
management s judgment in making these estimates and relying on these assumptions may materially impact amounts reported for any period 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that we believe have the most significant effect on our financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition software development costs valuation of inventories income taxes product warranty stock based compensation restructuring costs investments carrying value of goodwill carrying value of long lived assets 
table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product sales represent the majority of our revenue and include both hardware products and hardware products with embedded software 
revenue is recognized from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  products are sold on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically the shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which typically occurs upon shipment 
if these conditions are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as these conditions have been satisfi ed 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with other elements  such as software and maintenance  pt allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on their fair value 
revenue from software requiring significant production  modification  or customization is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
anticipated losses on contracts  if any  are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  revenue recognition is deferred and revenue will be recognized when all obligations under the arrangement are fulfilled 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
certain products are sold through distributors who are granted limited rights of return 
potential returns are accounted for at the time of sale 
the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is considered a critical accounting estimate because terms of sale can vary  and judgment is exercised in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are charged to expense as research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  using the straight line method or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if the technological feasibility for a particular project is judged not to have been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to cost of goods sold  as applicable 
the accounting estimate related to software development costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 

table of contents valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory are recorded after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials are the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks 
exposure to inventory valuation risks is managed by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certai n inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is considered a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors  ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles differ from estimates  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes pt provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets in amounts for which realization is not considered more likely than not to occur 
the accounting estimate related to income taxes is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if it should be determined that all or part of a net deferred tax asset is not able to be realized in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that it should be determined that all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future is in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income to be recognized in the period such determination was made 
pt operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of pt 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
in addition  the calculation of pt s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
pt recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires pt to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires pt to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
pt re evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstance s  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
finally  the value of pt s deferred tax assets is dependent upon pt s ability to generate future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which pt operates 
these assets consist of research credit carry forwards  capital and net operating loss carry forwards  and the future tax effect of temporary differences between balances recorded for financial statement purposes and for tax return purposes 
it will require future pre tax earnings of in excess of million in order to fully realize the value of the company s deferred tax assets 
of this amount  approximately  of capital gains must be realized in in order to fully realize pt s deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of pt s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance was recorded in against substantially the full value of its deferred tax assets 

table of contents product warranty warranty obligations are generally incurred in connection with the sale of pt s products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the accounting estimate related to product warranty is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
stock based compensation pt s board of directors approves grants of stock options to employees to purchase our common stock 
stock compensation expense is recorded based upon the estimated fair value of the stock option at the date of grant 
the accounting estimate related to stock based compensation is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating compensation expense including expected option lives  forfeiture rates and expected volatility 
expected option lives are estimated using vesting terms and contractual lives 
expected forfeiture rates and volatility are calculated using historical information 
actual option lives and forfeiture rates may be different from estimates and may result in potential future adjustments which would impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in a particular period 
restructuring costs restructuring costs may consist of employee related severance costs  lease termination costs and other facility related closing expenses 
employee related severance benefits are recorded either at the time an employee is notified or  if there are extended service periods  is estimated and recorded pro rata over the period of each planned restructuring activity 
lease termination costs are calculated based upon fair value considering the remaining lease obligation amounts and estimates for sublease receipts 
the accounting estimate related to restructuring costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating the amount of employee related severance benefits that will ultimately be paid and the amount of sublease receipts that will ultimately be received in future periods 
actual amounts paid for employee related severance benefits can vary from these estimat es depending upon the number of employees actually receiving severance payments 
actual sublease receipts received may also vary from estimates 
investments we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments  below their cost basis  are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining when a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price if available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee and the underlying collateral  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the extent to which the investment is guaranteed  the financial health of the guarantor if any  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until maturity or for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it were judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued as the current fair v alue and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected as an adjustment to net income 
such adjustments could materially adversely affect our operating results 
carrying value of goodwill tests for impairments of goodwill are conducted annually at year end  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
pt employs a two step method for determining goodwill impairment where step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
an impairment loss is then recognized to the extent that the goodwill s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
pt is considered to consist of being only one reporting unit 

table of contents the quoted market capitalization of pt was less than pt s book value at december  pt used a discounted cash flow valuation model applied to a five year projection of future cash flows in its evaluation of goodwill 
this cash flow valuation model necessarily involves considerable judgment in the estimation of inputs and assumptions used in this cash flow valuation model 
as a result of its analysis  pt recorded an impairment charge against the full recorded value of goodwill 
the accounting estimate related to impairment of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because pt s impairment tests include estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including revenue growth rates  expense levels  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact estimated future cash flows and the estimated implied fair value of pt 
carrying value of long lived assets in addition to impairment testing the recorded value of goodwill  pt reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  other than goodwill  capitalized software development costs and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
pt assesses the recoverability of the carrying values of long lived assets by first grouping its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
pt estimates the undiscounted cash flows over t he remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  pt records an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
pt determines fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analyses of discounted cash flows 
the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets is considered a critical accounting estimate because pt s impairment tests include estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including revenue growth rates  expense levels  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact estimated future cash flows and the estimated fair value of long lived assets 
key performance indicators pt believes that a key indicator for its business is the trend for the volume of orders received from customers 
during weak economic periods  customers ability to forecast their requirements deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
forward looking visibility on customer orders continues to be very low 
most of our oem customers are placing orders for product only when they have orders in hand from their customers 
total shipments to customers in amounted to million  compared to million in this significant decrease in revenue was attributable to weak demand from most of pt s traditional oem telecommunications customers and to sharply lower shipments of products to each of the company s two largest customers  metaswitch networks and alcatel lucent 
as a result of decreased product demand from their customers in  our combined shipments to metaswitch networks and alcatel lucent decreased by million 
overview performance technologies  incorporated pt  a delaware corporation founded in  is a global supplier of advanced network communications solutions to carrier  government and oem markets 
pt s product portfolio includes ip centric network solutions  elements and applications designed for high availability  scalability  and long life cycle deployments 
the company s entire line of offerings is anchored by ipnexus  pt s own ip native  highly integrated platforms and element management systems 
oems and application developers  including pt itself  leverage the carrier grade linux development environment and suite of communications protocols pt s nexusware of ipnexus application ready systems as a cornerstone component of their end product value proposition 
pt s segway signaling solutions provide low cost  high density signaling  advanced routing  ip migration  gateway capabilities  sip bridge  and core to edge distributed intelligence 

table of contents pt s business addresses one industry segment communications  and globally targets two primary vertical markets for its network communications products  namely telecommunications and government systems and defense 
the telecommunications market  historically our largest vertical market  is fundamentally driven by investments in network infrastructure by carriers and service providers 
telecommunications market revenues derived from our ipnexus application ready systems products depend primarily on broad  multi year deployments of next generation telecommunications infrastructure 
this market began deteriorating in the third quarter of as customers made decisions to preserve cash and only modestly began to improve during the second half of telecommunications market revenues generated from end user solutions  such as our segway and xpress product lines  are governed by investments necessary to support existing and evolving service demands suc h as the ongoing worldwide explosive growth in text messaging and the transition to internet based communications networks 
while some wireless carriers around the globe continue to significantly invest in their signaling network infrastructure and customer applications  many are delaying purchasing decisions as long as possible 
sales into the government systems and defense market are typically to prime contractors and system integrators that reflect investment levels by various government agencies and military branches in specific programs and projects requiring enhanced communications capabilities 
government systems and defense shipments are subject to project deployment schedules and are not often consistent from quarter to quarter 
we are continuing to see new government systems and defense project opportunities for our network communications products 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further discussion of the industry  markets and economic environment 
strategy the company strategy is to maximize the value proposition of its products by leveraging its field proven systems  software and hardware technologies 
management believes the tightly integrated combination of these technologies results in considerable benefits to our customers including a compelling return on investment proposition  significant development risk mitigation and a substantially accelerated time to market opportunity 
management is concentrating on four network communications focused initiatives to construct a solid foundation for long term growth 
these initiatives include further strengthening of our segway signaling systems product line  continued evolution and enhancement of our ipnexus application ready systems for mission critical communications applications  intensifying our market diversification efforts in government systems and defense markets  and identifying forward looking network communications growth opportunities  such as our xpress portfolio of sip based applications and enabling infrastructure  that we can pursue with our own end product solutions 
beginning in the fourth quarter  management proactively undertook several steps to further position pt for growth as business conditions improve 
these steps include the hiring of additional sales people to bolster our sales organization  the addition of several positions to our research and development team and the expansion of our product management team 
there are identifiable risks associated with pt s strategy in the current economic climate 
while management believes that its network communications market focus offers growth in the long term  some elements of the customer base in this market are experiencing very challenging economic conditions which are impacting business prospects 
management expects to realize measurable progress on the strategic initiatives it established in however  based on the current economic environment  which may involve new risks not currently identifiable  management believes that realizing meaningful profitability in the near term is likely to be very difficult

financial overview revenue revenue for amounted to million  compared to million in due to the global economic recession  pt s telecommunications customers sharply curtailed demand for the company s products as end users slashed capital expenditure budgets 
shipments to pt s two traditionally largest customers  metaswitch networks and alcatel lucent  declined by million in  from million in shipments to customers outside of the united states represented and of sales in and  respectively 
the decrease in shipments to customers outside of the united states was principally due to lower shipments to metaswitch networks and other oem telecommunications customers due to the global economic slowdown 
while shipments to customers in the united states also declined  the decline in the united states was less severe due primarily to a relatively stable demand for the company s signaling products 
shipments to the united kingdom represented and of pt s total sales in and  respectively

million  and purchases of treasury stock of 
million 
cash used by operating activities amounted to 
million in  as compared to cash generated by operating activities of million in the year over year decrease in cash generated from operating activities amounted to million and is primarily attributable to the million loss in  compared to net income in of million  reduced by non cash depreciation and amortization  and impairment charges of million and million  respectively  and offset by decreases in accounts receivable of 
million and inventories of 
million 
also contributing to the change were the non cash valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets which amounted to million and the non cash stock based compensation expense which amounted to 
million 
restructuring activities pt implemented two restructuring actions during in january  the company implemented a strategic reduction of its existing workforce in response to the challenging global economic environment 
as a result of this action  the company eliminated twenty positions in the first quarter  or approximately of its global workforce 
in the first quarter  pt recorded restructuring charges for cash expenditures associated with employee related costs of approximately 
million 
in july  the company implemented a voluntary separation program in which substantially all us employees were offered the opportunity to elect termination of employment  subject to the company s approval 
eight employees were voluntarily terminated under this program 
in the third quarter  pt recorded restructuring charges for cash expenditures associated with employee related costs of approximately 
million 
this action is expected to yield annual operating expense s avings of approximately 
million 
restructuring charges in principally related to charges for the change in estimated future cash flows from sub leasing the former san luis obispo engineering center and an agreement at year end to buy out the remaining lease term for this facility  for which the future lease payments were previously accrued in the consideration for the early termination of this lease amounted to 
million  which was paid in january results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain consolidated financial data expressed as a percentage of sales  which has been included as an aid to understanding pt s results and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

total revenue for amounted to million  compared to million for historically  pt s products are grouped into three distinct categories in one market segment communications products  computing products and switching products 
revenue from each product category is expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated communications computing switching total communication products communications products are comprised of network access  segway signaling and voice products 
network access products provide a connection between a variety of voice  data and signaling networks and pt s ipnexus systems and competing platforms that are used to control the network and or process information being transported over networks 
the company s segway signaling products  which are built on our ipnexus systems  provide a full suite of signaling solutions that seamlessly bridge between circuit switched networks and the growing ip based networks 
voice products enable voice  data and fax processing for communications applications 
revenue from communications products amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease in revenue of million  or  resulted primarily from decreases in sales of network access and voice products 

table of contents computing products computing products are primarily ipnexus systems  which are built upon pt s own us manufactured hardware combined with the company s nexusware carrier grade linux operating system and software development environment plus a broad suite of communications protocols and high availability middleware 
the product family also includes a range of single board compute elements and associated chassis management products 
computing products revenue totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue of million  or  was primarily attributable to a decrease in shipments to metaswitch networks amounting to million  plus decreases in shipments to the company s other computing products customers 
these declines are attributable to considerably lower end user demand in light of the global economic slowdown and intentional reductions in inventory levels by the company s oem telecommunications customers 
switching products pt s ethernet switch elements operate as the nexus of the ip packet switching functionality for ipnexus systems and competing platforms 
switch revenue totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue of million  or  is primarily due to substantially lower shipments to alcatel lucent  one of pt s traditionally two largest customers 
shipments to alcatel lucent decreased by million in demand from pt s other switching products customers also declined primarily due to significantly reduced capital expenditures among their end user customers 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales  less cost of goods sold including material costs  manufacturing expenses  depreciation  amortization of software development costs  and expenses associated with engineering contracts and the technical support function  and totaled million and million in and  respectively 
gross margin was and of sales for and  respectively 
despite improved product mix  gross margin as a percentage of sales fell in due primarily to the non absorption of fixed manufacturing costs  which resulted from significantly lower sales and production volumes 
also included in cost of goods sold is the amortization of software development costs which totaled million and million in and  respectively

carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually as of december st of each fiscal year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill might exceed the fair value 
management has determined that the company has one reporting unit for purposes of applying the impairment testing rules based on its reporting structure 
the fair value of the company s single reporting unit at each measurement date is determined based on a combination of the fair market value of the company s outstanding common stock on a control basis  a discounted cash flow valuation model applied to a projection of future cash flows 
management performed an interim assessment of the carrying value of goodwill as of june  due to the low price of the company s stock in relation to its book value per share and due to the second quarter decision to record a valuation charge against the company s deferred tax assets 
based on that assessment  management determined that the fair value of the company was in excess of its book value including goodwill  and therefore it was not necessary to record impairment at that date 
the results of the annual impairment tests performed as of december  and indicated the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
due to the company s decreased stock price during the second half of and resulting lower market capitalization  particularly in comparison with the recovery in united states equity markets  management recorded an impairment charge amounting to million against the full recorded value of goodwill based on the company s assessment at december  
table of contents in conjunction with the review for impairment of goodwill at december   pt also performed a review of the recoverability of its other long lived assets 
as a result  pt recorded a non cash impairment charge against the carrying value of property  equipment and improvements amounting to 
million 
other income  net 
other income consists primarily of interest income and totaled 
million in  compared to million in this decrease was due to a sharp decline in the yields the company earned on its investments  resulting from lower interest rates in general and the company s decision to invest in lower risk investment securities

on march   an amended complaint was served on the company through its designated agent in north carolina
