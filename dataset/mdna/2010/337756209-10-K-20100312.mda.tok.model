item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our indebtedness 
the non renewal  modification  or cancellation of affiliation agreements with major television networks  including our affiliation agreement with fox network for kbfx which expires in  could harm our operating results 
each of our television stations affiliation with one of the four major television networks has a significant impact on the composition of the station s programming  revenue  expenses and operations 
in some instances  network affiliation agreements are not renewed  or in limited circumstances  may be cancelled by the network 
for example  if a network acquires a television station in a market in which we own a station affiliated with that network  the network will likely decline to renew the affiliation agreement for our station in that market 
our two largest television stations  komo tv  which broadcasts in seattle  washington  and katu  which broadcasts in portland  oregon  have affiliation agreements with abc network with current terms expiring in august the major network affiliations for our television stations other than komo tv and katu are with cbs or fox 
our affiliation agreements with cbs generally expire in february our only affiliation agreement with the fox network expires  at kbfx  in june the non renewal of any of our major network affiliation agreements could adversely affect our business and results 
while we generally expect to renew our affiliation agreements prior to their expiration  there can be no assurances that we will do so  or on terms that are beneficial to us 
although none of our affiliation agreements with cbs or abc are scheduled for renewal in  any modification  cancellation or eventual non renewal of any of these agreements could harm our operating results 
some of the networks with which our stations are affiliated may require as a condition to the renewal of affiliation agreements  among other things  elimination of network affiliate compensation and  in some cases  cash payments to the network 
consequently  our affiliation agreements may not remain in place under existing terms and each network may not continue to provide programming or compensation to affiliates on the same basis as it currently provides programming or compensation 
if this occurs  we would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 
a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short term and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include the following increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  costs of building a new or larger news operation and other increases in station programming costs  if necessary  and the cost of equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation  if any 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the major network s audience share and the fact that national network audience ratings are not necessarily indicative of how a network s programming is accepted in an individual market 
there can be no assurances that any future affiliation agreement will be obtainable on economic terms or other conditions that will be favorable to us  nor that any network could not change the type  quality or quantity of programming provided to us in a way that could be detrimental to our operations 
competition in the broadcasting industry and the rise of alternative entertainment and communications media may result in loss of audience share and advertising revenue by our stations 
our television and radio stations face intense competition  including competition from the following sources other local network affiliates and independent stations  cable  direct broadcast satellite and alternative methods of broadcasting brought about by technological advances and innovations  including pay per view and home video and entertainment systems  television networks and other programmers that have begun to distribute their programming directly to the consumer via the internet and portable digital devices such as video ipods and mobile phones  and other sources of news  information and entertainment  including streaming video broadcasts over the internet  podcasting  newspapers  magazines  movie theaters and live sporting events 
in addition to competing with other media outlets for audience share  we also compete for advertising revenue that comprises our primary source of revenue 
our stations compete for advertising revenue with other television and radio stations in their respective markets  as well as with other advertising media such as newspapers  the internet  magazines  outdoor advertising  transit advertising  yellow page directory  direct mail and local cable systems 
cable companies and others have developed national advertising networks in recent years that increase the competition for national advertising 
our stations also compete against other local media outlets for exclusive local access to programming 
competition for non network programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first run and off network packages of programming 
our operating results are dependent in part upon the ability of each of our stations to compete successfully in its market  and there can be no assurance that any one of our stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience share or revenue share 
our television stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues primarily on the basis of programming content and advertising rates 
advertising rates are set based upon a variety of factors  including a program s popularity among the advertiser s target audience  the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the demographic make up of the market served and the availability of alternative advertising in the market 
our ability to maintain market share and competitive advertising rates depends in part on audience acceptance of our network  syndicated and local programming 
to the extent that certain of our competitors have  or may in the future obtain  greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources  audience share or revenue share  our ability to compete successfully in our broadcasting markets may be impeded 
if we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry trends  our television and radio businesses may not be able to compete effectively 
new technologies could continue to adversely affect our television and radio stations 
information delivery and programming alternatives including cable  direct satellite to home services  video provided by telephone companies  satellite radio  pay per view  the internet  digital video recorders and home video and entertainment systems  portable entertainment systems  mp players  and mobile phones have fractionalized television and radio audiences and expanded the numbers and types of distribution channels for advertisers to access 
over the past decade  cable television programming services  other emerging video distribution platforms and the internet have captured an increasing market share  while the aggregate viewership of the major television networks has declined 
in addition  the expansion of cable and satellite television  the internet and other technological changes including the increased usage of video on demand have increased  and may continue to increase  the competitive demand for programming 
such increased demand  together with rising production costs  may increase our programming costs or impair our ability to acquire desired programming 
technologies that enable users to view content of their own choosing  in their own time  and to fast forward or skip advertisements  such as dvrs  portable digital devices  video on demand  and the internet  may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers 
other advances in technology  such as increasing use of local cable advertising interconnects  which allow for easier insertion of advertising on local cable systems  have also increased competition for advertisers 
in addition  video compression techniques  now in use with direct broadcast satellites and potentially soon for cable and wireless cable  are expected to permit greater numbers of channels to be carried within existing bandwidth 
these compression techniques as well as other technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems  including over the air broadcasting  and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences 
reduction in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming 
this ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences may alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures 
we are unable to predict the effect that these and other technological changes will have on the television industry or the future results of our television businesses 
our inability to effectively respond to these technological changes may result in our inability to effectively compete for advertising revenue and programming 
in recent years  the television networks have streamed their programming on the internet and other distribution platforms in close proximity to network programming broadcast on local television stations  including those owned by us 
these and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by local stations and could adversely affect our stations results of operations 
pending initiatives to reallocate television spectrum and to impose a performance tax on radio broadcasters could  if enacted  adversely affect our business  operation results and stock price 
new mobile communications technologies are increasingly offering internet broadband services using wireless spectrum 
recently  in connection with the fcc s development of a national broadband plan a plan the fcc is required to develop pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of to ensure wide access to broadband capability throughout the united states various parties  in particular mobile communications providers  have expressed concern that the united states will not have spectrum sufficient to meet demand for wireless broadband services in the near future 
in response  the fcc is in the process of reviewing various spectrum bands  including the bands currently licensed to television broadcasters  to determine if all or a portion of the spectrum within these bands may be repurposed for wireless broadband services 
various scenarios are being considered  including voluntary reallocation of spectrum that broadcasters agree to surrender  which may be all or a portion of a particular station s spectrum  and compensation to broadcasters from the proceeds from the auction of reallocated spectrum to other services 
this reallocation could limit our ability to realize the full potential of digital television  including high definition  multicast programming  and mobile television 
related reductions in the quality or quantity of our services may impede our ability to compete for programming  diminish the size of our audience  or reduce our advertising revenues 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any proposals made in this proceeding  however  the reallocation of all or some portions of our television stations spectrum and increased competition from new mobile communications technologies could materially affect our operating results  financial condition and stock price 
the recording industry has requested that congress impose a performance tax on radio broadcasters that would require local stations to pay record labels and performers for the music they air on the radio without charge to listeners 
this tax would be in addition to the license fees paid by broadcasters to writers and composers 
if enacted a performance tax such as this could materially affect the financial results of our radio stations 
we may experience disruptions in our business if we sell or acquire and integrate new television or radio stations 
as part of our business strategy and subject to market conditions  we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities to sell or acquire television and radio stations 
if we make acquisitions in the future  we may need to use more of our existing cash  incur more debt  or issue equity securities  and we may incur contingent liabilities and amortization and or impairment expenses related to intangible assets 
further  we cannot provide assurance that we will find other attractive acquisition candidates or effectively manage the integration of acquired stations into our existing business 
if the expected operating efficiencies from acquisitions do not materialize  if we fail to integrate new stations or recently acquired stations into our existing business  if the costs of such integration exceed expectations or if undertaking such sales or acquisitions diverts management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  television and radio station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest some television or radio stations if the fcc believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations changes in fcc regulations regarding ownership have increased the uncertainty surrounding the competitive position of our stations in the markets we serve 
section h of the telecommunications act of requires the fcc to review its ownership rules every four years to determine whether any of such rules are necessary in the public interest as the result of competition 
under section h  the fcc shall repeal or modify any regulation it determines to be no longer in the public interest 
recently  the fcc commenced its quadrennial review of its media ownership rules and is conducting a series of public forums and workshops designed to collect information and solicit public input for the review 
we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding nor the effect that any particular outcome will have on our stations and business 
the fcc concluded its quadrennial review in february  in which the fcc also addressed issues raised by the us court of appeals for the third circuit in connection with the third circuit s review of the fcc s ownership rule review 
in the review  the fcc relaxed certain of its local media ownership rules  including its local television ownership limitations and its prohibition against common ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations in the same market 
it also modified its local radio ownership limitations in a way that could limit our ability to acquire additional radio stations in existing markets that we serve 
the fcc s new rules were to have become effective on september   but were stayed by the third circuit 
in june  the court remanded the new rules to the fcc with instructions to undertake additional analysis of the record in order to justify its decision 
in september  the third circuit court lifted its stay insofar as it applied to the modified local radio ownership rules  which are largely in effect 
in the remand order  the fcc liberalized its broadcast newspaper cross ownership rule and declined to modify its other ownership rules which  except for the modified local radio ownership rules  are currently in effect as effective prior to the fcc s review 
because the third circuit stayed the effectiveness of any modifications to the ownership rules until it reviews the fcc s compliance with its june order  the broadcast newspaper cross ownership rule modification will not go into effect until the court has completed its review 
a number of media companies and public interest groups have challenged the fcc s february order before the third circuit  and others have asked the fcc to reconsider the order 
those challenges remain pending 
in december  the third circuit asked the fcc to explain why the court should not lift its stay on the effectiveness of the broadcast newspaper cross ownership rule modification and start hearing the new appeals 
in response  the fcc requested that the court s stay remain in place and the challenges held in abeyance until the fcc has completed its quadrennial review 
under existing law a single entity is permitted to have an attributable interest in television stations serving up to of us television households 
the cap is statutorily excluded from the fcc quadrennial review requirement 
large broadcast groups may take advantage of this law to expand further their ownership interests on a national basis 
any relaxation of ownership restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to those with greater financial and other resources than we possess 
we expect that the consolidation of ownership of broadcasting and newspapers in the hands of a smaller number of competitors would intensify the competition in our markets  which could harm our future operating results 
changes in laws and regulations of the broadcasting industry and changes in enforcement policies may have an adverse effect on our business 
the broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act of  as amended 
compliance with and the effects of existing and future regulations could have a material adverse impact on us 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio and television stations 
issuance  renewal  assignment  or transfer of broadcast station operating licenses requires fcc approval 
under the communications act  the fcc generally may grant and renew broadcast licenses for terms of eight years  though licenses may be renewed for a shorter period or denied under certain circumstances 
while the majority of such licenses are renewed by the fcc  we cannot assure you that our licenses will be renewed at their expiration dates  or  if renewed  that the renewal terms will be for eight years 
if the fcc decides to include conditions or qualifications in any of our licenses  we may be limited in the manner in which we may operate the affected stations 
except for katu and katu s translator stations  fcc licenses for our various television and radio stations expire in  or the license renewal application for katu and katu s translator stations for the term expiring february   was timely filed in september on december   a petition to deny was filed by oregon alliance to reform media  or oarm  against katu and seven other television stations licensed to serve the portland  oregon market 
oarm argued that the stations each failed to present adequate programming relating to state and local elections during the election cycle in their news and public affairs programming 
the fcc s media bureau rejected oarm s petition 
however  on september   oarm petitioned the fcc for reconsideration of that decision 
that petition remains pending  and we cannot predict when or how the fcc will address it 
katu s authority to operate is automatically extended while its renewal application is on file and under review 
we must comply with extensive fcc ownership regulations and policies 
in general  the fcc s ownership rules limit the number of television and radio stations that we can own in a market and the number of television stations we can own nationwide 
the fcc attributes interests held by  among others  a licensee entity s officers  directors  certain stockholders  and in some circumstances  lenders  to that entity for purposes of applying these ownership limitations 
the ownership rules may prevent us from acquiring additional stations in a particular market 
we may also be prevented from engaging in a swap transaction if the swap would cause the other company to violate these rules 
we may further be prevented from implementing certain joint operations with competitors which might make the operation of our stations more efficient 
federal legislation and fcc rules have changed significantly in recent years and can be expected to continue to change 
these changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may thereby affect our operating results 
federal law and the fcc s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time  and the broadcast of indecent or profane material during the period from am through am in recent years  the fcc has vigorously enforced its indecency prohibition  and in  legislation was enacted that raised the maximum monetary penalty for the broadcast of obscene  indecent  or profane language to  for each violation  with a cap of million for any single act 
the determination of whether content is indecent or profane is inherently subjective  creates uncertainty as to our ability to comply with the rules in particular during live programming  and impacts our programming decisions 
violation of the indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in recent years  the fcc has also vigorously enforced a number of other rules  typically in connection with license renewals 
for example  in recent years  the fcc has issued fines and sanctions for violations of its equal employment opportunity rules  public inspection file rules  children s programming rules  commercial time limits rules  sponsorship identification rules  closed captioning rules  station conducted contest rules  and emergency alert system rules 
if we are unable to secure or maintain carriage of our television stations signals over cable and or direct broadcast satellite systems  our television stations may not be able to compete effectively 
pursuant to fcc rules  local television stations may elect every three years to either require cable and or direct broadcast satellite operators to carry the station s primary programming stream or enter into retransmission consent negotiations for carriage  which may include carriage of a station s primary and multicast programming streams 
unless a retransmission consent agreement is reached  cable and direct satellite operators are not required to carry our multicast programming streams 
at present  we have retransmission consent agreements with the major cable operators in our markets and both satellite providers  including carriage of certain of our multicast programming streams 
if our retransmission consent agreements are terminated or not renewed  or if our broadcast signals are distributed on less favorable terms than our competitors  our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected 
dependence on key personnel may expose us to additional risks 
our business is dependent on the performance of certain key employees  including executive officers and senior operational personnel 
while we have entered into change of control agreements with some of our key executives  we do not enter into employment agreements with most of our key executive officers and senior operational personnel 
we also employ several on air personalities who have significant loyal audiences in their respective markets  with whom we have entered into employment agreements 
we cannot assure you that all such key personnel or on air personalities will remain with us or that our on air personalities will renew their contracts 
the loss of any key personnel could harm our operations and financial results 
failure of our information technology systems would disrupt our operations  which could reduce our customer base and result in lost revenue 
our computer systems are vulnerable to viruses  unauthorized tampering  system failures and potential obsolescence 
our operations depend on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers and computer systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
our computer systems are also subject to potential system failures and obsolescence 
any of these events could cause system interruption  delays and loss of critical data that would adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers 
our recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
our ownership and operation of fisher plaza is subject to risks  including those relating to the economic climate  local real estate conditions  potential inability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  potential collection problems  reliance on significant tenants  and regulatory risks 
revenue and operating income from  and the value of  fisher plaza may be adversely affected by the general economic climate  the seattle economic climate and real estate conditions  including prospective tenants perceptions of the attractiveness of the property and the availability of space in other competing properties 
in addition  the economic conditions in the telecommunications and high tech sectors may significantly affect our ability to attract tenants to fisher plaza  because space at fisher plaza is marketed in significant part to organizations from these sectors 
other risks relating to the operation of fisher plaza include the potential inability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and the potential inability to collect rent  due to bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise  especially in light of the current difficult economic environment 
we also risk facing lower rents due to the current economic downturn and abundance of available commercial space in downtown seattle 
real estate income and values may also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws and regulations  including tax and environmental laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rent loss insurance with respect to fisher plaza 
there are  however  certain losses that may be either uninsurable  not economically insurable  or in excess of our current insurance coverage limits 
if an uninsured loss occurs  it could harm our operating results 
for example  on july   an electrical fire contained within a garage level equipment room of the east building of fisher plaza disrupted city supplied electrical service to that building 
a third party investigation concluded that the fire appears to have been caused by a malfunction of bus duct equipment manufactured by a third party 
we incurred approximately million in expenditures related to the fisher plaza fire  comprised of remediation expenses of million and capital expenditures of million 
during the year ended december   the company recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  total plaza fire expenses of million  consisting of a million loss on fixed assets destroyed by the fire plus the above mentioned million of remediation expenses offset by million of insurance reimbursements 
our insurers have indicated that the event is a covered occurrence under the applicable insurance policies  and they continue to investigate the incident 
we currently expect that a significant portion of our incurred costs will be covered by our insurance policies 
however  the actual amount and timing of the reimbursement remains subject to the insurance companies investigation 
we intend to vigorously assert all of our claims related to the fisher plaza fire as necessary 
we are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting  if identified in future periods  could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec rules  we are required to furnish a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as part of our annual report on form k 
our independent registered public accountants are required to audit and provide a separate opinion on their evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting 
to issue our report  we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion  and then we test and evaluate the results 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses  if any  that may be identified in future periods  or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement 
if we or our independent registered public accountants discover a material weakness  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  could reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
we may not be able to effectively and timely implement necessary control changes and employee training to ensure continued compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and other regulatory and reporting requirements 
there likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel  especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies 
our operations may be adversely affected by earthquakes and other natural catastrophes in the pacific northwest or california 
our corporate headquarters  fisher plaza and the majority of our operations are located in the pacific northwest and we own two television stations in california 
the pacific northwest and california have from time to time experienced earthquakes 
we do not know the ultimate impact on our operations of being located near major earthquake faults  but an earthquake could harm our operating results 
our broadcasting towers may also be affected by other natural catastrophes  such as forest fires 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural catastrophes

you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are based on our current expectations and projections about future events  are not guarantees of future performance  are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions including those described herein and apply only as of the date of this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled risk factors as well as those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion is intended to provide an analysis of significant trends and material changes in our financial position and operating results during the period from through overview we are an integrated media company 
we own and operate full power including a owned television station and seven low power television stations and ten owned or managed radio stations 
our television stations are located in washington  oregon  idaho and california  and our radio stations are located in washington and montana 
we also own and operate fisher plaza  a mixed use commercial facility located near downtown seattle that serves as the home for our corporate offices and our seattle television and radio stations 
we lease a majority of the space at fisher plaza to a variety of unaffiliated companies 
our broadcasting operations receive revenue from the sale of local  regional and national advertising and  to a much lesser extent  from retransmission consent fees  network compensation  tower rental and commercial production activities 
our operating results are  therefore  sensitive to broad economic trends that affect the broadcasting industry in general  as well as local and regional trends  particularly those affecting the pacific northwest economy 
the advertising revenue of our stations is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring  and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during national election years due to spending by political candidates and advocacy groups 
this political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
our television revenue is significantly affected by network affiliation and the success of programming offered by those networks 
our two largest television stations  komo tv and katu tv  accounted for approximately percent of our television broadcasting revenue in and are affiliated with the abc television network 
nine of our television stations including a owned television station are affiliated with the cbs television network  six of our television stations are affiliated with univision spanish language  one of our television stations is affiliated with the fox television network and the remainder of our television stations are independent 
we have affiliation agreements with the abc television network with current terms expiring in august our affiliation agreements with the cbs television network generally expire in february our only affiliation agreement with fox television network expires in june the non renewal of any of our major network affiliation agreements could adversely affect our business and results 
our broadcasting operations are subject to competitive pressures from traditional broadcasting sources  as well as from alternative methods of delivering information and entertainment  and these pressures may cause fluctuations in operating results 
in addition to our broadcasting operations  we own and operate fisher plaza  and we lease space to other companies that are attracted by the property location and the infrastructure provided at this facility 
at december   approximately of fisher plaza was occupied or committed for occupancy occupied by fisher entities  compared to occupied or committed for occupancy at december  occupied by fisher entities 
revenue and operating income from fisher plaza are dependent upon the general economic climate  the seattle economic climate  the outlook of the telecommunications and technology sectors and commercial real estate conditions  including the availability of space in other competing properties 
management focuses on key metrics from operational data within our broadcasting and fisher plaza operations 
information on significant trends is provided in the section entitled consolidated results of operations 
significant developments the following significant developments affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and datasphere investment 
in december  we purchased shares of series b preferred stock of datasphere technologies  inc for million in cash 
datasphere is a software as a service web technology and hyperlocal ad sales company focused on generating online profits for media companies 
since august  we have utilized datasphere s technology and sales solution to launch over hyperlocal neighborhood websites 
we also work with datasphere in its distribution of its technology and sales solution to other broadcast companies looking to establish hyperlocal sites 
see business internet hyperlocal sites 
abc affiliate agreement 
in august  we renewed our network affiliation agreement with american broadcasting companies  inc abc 
the renewed affiliation agreement  which requires that we pay an annual license fee to abc for network programming  expires on august  fisher plaza fire 
on july   an electrical fire contained within a garage level equipment room of the east building of our fisher plaza facility disrupted city supplied electrical service to that building 
a third party investigation concluded that the fire appears to have been caused by a malfunction of bus duct equipment manufactured by a third party 
all of the final repairs and equipment replacement have been completed as of december  we incurred approximately million of expenditures related to the fisher plaza fire  including remediation expenses of million and capital expenditures of million

certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial information to conform to the current presentation 
reclassifications include the results of pegasus news  inc from continuing operations to discontinued operations and the results of our five small market radio stations from discontinued operations to continued operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these reclassifications have no effect on previously reported net income loss 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including  but not limited to  those affecting revenues  goodwill and intangibles impairment  the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables and broadcast rights  stock based compensation expense  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes and liabilities and contingencies 
the brief discussion below is intended to highlight some of the judgments and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and the specific dollar amounts reported on our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
many of our estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance  and as such are forward looking in nature  and are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we consider critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this is not a complete list of all of our accounting policies  and there may be other accounting policies that are significant to us 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and our other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them  as presented in this annual report 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of certain media properties over the fair value of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible net assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist of certain television licenses primarily fcc licenses 
in making estimates of fair values for the purposes of allocating the purchase price  we rely primarily on our extensive knowledge of the market and  if considered appropriate  will obtain valuations from independent valuation specialists 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we consider information obtained as a result of pre acquisition due diligence  including independent valuation reports that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective assets 
we evaluate the potential for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  or whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
the goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with the carrying amounts of net assets  including goodwill  related to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit s fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill in the reporting unit being tested 
fair values are determined based on valuations that rely primarily on the discounted cash flow method and market multiples of current earnings 
this method uses future projections of cash flows from each of our reporting units and includes  among other estimates  projections of future advertising revenue and operating expenses  market supply and demand  projected capital spending and an assumption of our weighted average cost of capital  as adjusted for market participant data 
our indefinite lived assets broadcast licenses  which are not subject to amortization  are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis by applying a fair value based test as required 
our evaluations of fair values include analyses based on the estimated future cash flows generated by the underlying assets  estimated trends  and other relevant determinants of fair value for these assets 
if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and its carrying value 
changes in any of these estimates  projections and assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of these assets in future measurement periods and result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles which could materially affect our results of operations 
the impairment test for fcc licenses consists of a station by station comparison of the carrying amount of fcc licenses with their fair value  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we believe our estimate of the value of our goodwill and broadcasting licenses is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
tangible long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we use our judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment analysis is necessary 
factors we consider which could trigger an impairment analysis include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or significant negative cash flows or industry trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is primarily based on market transactions for comparable businesses  discounted cash flows and a review of the underlying assets of the reporting unit 
in estimating future cash flows  we use future projections of cash flows directly associated with  and that were expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
these projections rely on significant assumptions 
if it is determined that a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value 
changes in any of our estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and could result in a future impairment of the involved assets with a material effect on our future results of operations 
television and radio broadcast rights 
television and radio broadcast rights are recorded as assets when the license period begins and the programs are available for broadcast  at the gross amount of the related obligations or  for non sports first run programming  at the amount of the annual obligation 
costs incurred in connection with the purchase of programs to be broadcast within one year are classified as current assets  while costs of those programs to be broadcast after one year are considered non current 
these programming costs are charged to operations over their estimated broadcast periods using either the straight line method or in proportion to estimated revenue of the related program 
program obligations are classified as current or non current in accordance with the payment terms of the license agreement 
revenue recognition 
television and radio revenue is recognized  net of advertising agency commissions  when the advertisement is broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
we may trade certain advertising time for products or services  as well as barter advertising time for program material 
trade transactions are generally reported at the estimated fair value of the product or service received  while barter transactions are reported at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
revenue is reported on trade and barter transactions when commercials are broadcast and expenses are reported when products or services are utilized or when programming airs 
we receive consideration from certain satellite  cable and wireless providers in return for consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations 
revenue from production of broadcast media content is recognized when a contracted production is available for distribution 
revenues from retransmission consent and satellite transmission services are recognized when the service is performed 
website advertising revenue is recognized as services are delivered 
rentals from real estate leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  while revenue from related service fees is recognized when the services are delivered 
accrued retirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory supplemental retirement program that was established for key management 
no new participants have been admitted to this program since and the benefits of active participants were frozen in the program participants do not include any of our current executive officers 
the program provides for vesting of benefits under certain circumstances 
funding is not required  but we have made investments in annuity contracts and maintain life insurance policies on the lives of the individual participants to assist in our payment of retirement benefits 
we are the owner and beneficiary of the annuity contracts and life insurance policies 
accordingly  the cash value of the annuity contracts and the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies are reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
the supplemental retirement program requires continued employment or disability through the date of expected retirement 
the cost of the program is recognized over the participants average expected future lifetime 
the cost of this program is reported and accounted for in accordance with accounting rules that require significant assumptions regarding such factors as discount rates 
we use an independent actuarial consulting firm to assist in estimating the supplemental retirement obligation and related periodic expenses 
the discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was at december  and at december  the rate of increase in future compensation was no longer applicable at december  or due to freezing plan benefits for active participants 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results could differ from our estimates 
changes in benefits provided by us may also affect future plan costs 
income taxes 
the preparation of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in assessing whether  and to what extent  deferred tax assets can be realized  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover some or all our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and are required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of our deferred tax assets not considered recoverable 
the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant judgment and is based upon our best estimate of anticipated taxable profits in various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
changes in expectations and actual future results could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
at december   we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets as management believes that it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets are realizable 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in the need to establish a valuation allowance for our federal deferred tax assets 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient state taxable income to realize our deferred state tax assets  we have established a valuation allowance for financial reporting purposes 
the valuation allowance was million at december  and our federal and state income tax returns are subject to periodic examination and the tax authorities may challenge certain of our tax positions as a result of examinations 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the tax authorities could require us to make additional tax payments 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are sometimes ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make certain subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
accordingly  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
we believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors  including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded for the years ended december  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on factors such as the level of past due balances for each business unit  as well as changes in current economic conditions 
variable interest entities 
we may enter into joint sales agreements jsas or lmas with non owned stations 
under the terms of these agreements  we make specific periodic payments to the station s owner operator in exchange for the right to provide programming and or sell advertising on a portion of the station s broadcast time 
nevertheless  the owner operator retains control and responsibility for the operation of the station  including responsibility over all programming broadcast on the station 
generally  we continue to operate the station and sell advertising under the lma agreement and sell advertising under the jsa agreement until the termination of such agreement 
as a result of these agreements  we may determine that the station is a variable interest entity vie and that we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest 
this typically occurs if we also have an agreement to acquire a station and the conditions to close are considered to be perfunctory 
we also may determine that a station is a vie in connection with other types of local service agreements entered into with stations in markets in which we own and operate a station 
we did not have any vie s in or stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
our estimation of the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected life of the award  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  forfeitures and projected exercise behaviors 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
consolidated results of operations we report financial data for three reportable segments television  radio and fisher plaza 
the television segment includes the operations of our owned and operated network affiliated television stations including a owned television station and internet business 
the radio segment includes the operations of our eight radio stations and two managed radio stations 
corporate expenses are allocated to the television and radio segments on a pro rata basis 
the fisher plaza segment consists of the operations of fisher plaza  a retail  office and communications center located near downtown seattle that serves as the home of our seattle based television and radio operations  our corporate offices and third party tenants 
fisher owned entities that reside at fisher plaza do not pay rent  but do pay common area maintenance expenses 
the segment data includes additional allocation of depreciation and certain operating expenses from fisher plaza to our television and radio segments

reclassifications include the results of pegasus news  inc from continuing operations to discontinued operations see note to our consolidated financial statements  and the results of our five remaining small market radio stations from discontinued operations to continuing operations see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these reclassifications have no effect on previously reported net income 
revenue advertising revenues decreased in as compared to due to several factors discussed below 
a significant portion of our revenue consists of advertising by companies in the retail and automotive sectors 
continued difficulties  including bankruptcies  in these and other key industries have adversely affected total advertising expenditures in the united states 
continued reductions in spending by these and other industries during and beyond could continue to adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
in light of the recent united states supreme court decision in citizens united v 
fec in which the court struck down federal laws banning independent electoral and issue advocacy sponsored by nonprofit and for profit corporations  we may experience higher than normal political advertising revenue in the future  including however  we are currently unable to predict whether any increases will occur in light of the current national and local economic conditions  which can adversely impact our pricing and sellout levels 
television 
television revenue decreased million or in as compared to  primarily due to sharp declines in local and political advertising spending  partially offset by an increase in national advertising and retransmission revenues 
local advertising revenues declined as a result of the broad economic recession and the absence of our stations from the dish network dish in the first half of due to the expiration of our retransmission agreement with dish in december political advertising revenues declined as was a minor political year 
national advertising revenues increased marginally from the prior year 
retransmission revenue increased million  or  in compared to as a result of our execution of new retransmission consent agreements with over distribution partners in the fourth quarter of and during additionally  on june   we executed a new multi year retransmission agreement with dish 
as part of the agreement  we agreed to release all prior legal claims against dish 
retransmission fees under the new dish agreement began accruing as of the date of execution 
television revenue increased in as compared to  primarily due to increased political advertising  offset by a decrease in non political national and local advertising revenue due to overall weak advertising demand in the economic downturn 
the acquisition of our two bakersfield  california television stations in january contributed million in additional television revenue for the year ended december  revenues from our abc affiliated stations and our cbs affiliated stations decreased and  respectively  in as compared to  due primarily to declines in local and political advertising spending  partially offset by an increase in national and retransmission revenues 
local advertising revenues declined as a result of the broad economic recession and the absence of our stations from dish 
political revenues declined as was a minor political year 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in retransmission revenues 
revenues from our abc affiliated stations were relatively flat in as compared to  due primarily to increases in political advertising offset by weak demand in non political national and local advertising 
revenues from cbs affiliated stations increased over the same period  excluding the addition of our bakersfield cbs station  due to weak demand in non political national and local advertising at our other cbs stations 
television network compensation revenue was approximately  in   in  and million in the decline in network compensation revenue is due to the renewal in of the network affiliation agreement with abc for komo tv in seattle and katu tv in portland through august which does not provide for any network compensation revenue 
our network affiliation agreements with cbs  which were renewed in january through february  include network compensation which we recognize on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
the fox and univision affiliation agreements do not provide for any network compensation revenue 
radio 
radio revenue decreased million or in  as compared to  primarily as a result of the expiration of our mariners broadcast agreement and a decline in local advertising revenue 
excluding revenue specifically attributable to our mariners broadcast agreement  radio revenue decreased for the year ended december  as compared to we attribute the decrease to weak demand in advertising spending as a result of the broad economic recession 
revenue and expenses from our five small market great falls  montana radio operations have been included in the regular operations of the radio segment as we no longer consider them held for sale 
this change has been reflected in the prior year comparisons as well 
radio revenue decreased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of a decline in local advertising revenue and in revenue attributed to our broadcasting of seattle mariners baseball games 
excluding revenue specifically attributable to our mariners broadcast agreement  radio revenue decreased for the year ended december  as compared to we attribute the decrease to weak demand for non political revenues across all categories 
fisher plaza 
the revenue increase at fisher plaza in compared to was due primarily to an expansion of leased space for certain of our existing tenants and increased service fees and base rent for our current tenants 
the revenue increase at fisher plaza in and as compared to the prior years  was due primarily to increased rental and service fees  as well as increased electrical infrastructure fees  parking garage fees and tenant reimbursements 
occupancy levels have remained consistent at fisher plaza over the past three years 
fisher plaza occupancy was for each of the years ended december   and direct operating costs direct operating costs are expenses required to produce and promote broadcast programming for our television and radio segments and costs to operate fisher plaza 
many of these costs are relatively fixed in nature and do not necessarily vary on a proportional basis with revenue 
television 
the decrease in direct operating costs of million  or  for the television segment in as compared to was primarily the result of a reduction in headcount and associated compensation costs and benefits  plus a reduction in promotional spending 
the reduction in these costs was partially offset by an increase in our network programming costs as a result of the renewal of our abc affiliation agreement 
the increase in direct operating costs for our television segment in as compared to was primarily due to the expenses associated with operating our new bakersfield television stations  as well as increased promotional spending 
in addition  expenses rose as we invested in our television news product and incurred news costs associated with our growing internet business 
radio 
the decrease of million  or  in direct operating costs at our radio segment for as compared to was primarily due to the termination of our mariners broadcast agreement in the termination of this agreement resulted in reduced rights fees  as well as a reduction in personnel and promotional costs 
increased direct operating costs at our radio segment for as compared to were primarily due to increased labor costs 
fisher plaza 
the decrease in direct operating costs of  or  at fisher plaza in as compared to was primarily attributable to decreased management costs and repair and maintenance expenditures 
the increase in direct operating costs at fisher plaza in as compared to was primarily attributable to increased property taxes  maintenance costs and utilities expenses 
other 
the other category consists primarily of the reclassification and elimination of certain operating expenses between operating segments 
for example  komo tv and seattle radio recognize facilities related intercompany expenses as selling  general and administrative  while fisher plaza records the reimbursement of these intercompany expenses as a reduction of direct operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses television 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  or  in the television segment in as compared to was due primarily to a decrease in commissions as a result of the decline in advertising revenue and personnel reductions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the television segment in as compared to was due primarily to the addition of our two bakersfield stations  as well as an increase in commissions  market research and development expenses and selling costs associated with our growing internet business 
in april we terminated national advertising representation agreements with contractual termination penalties 
as a result we recorded approximately million as a non cash charge to selling  general and administrative expense and are amortizing the resulting deferred credit on a straight line basis over the five year term of the new contract 
radio 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  or  at our radio segment in compared to was due primarily to the termination of our mariners broadcast agreement in selling  general and administrative expenses at our radio segment in were relatively flat compared to fisher plaza 
total selling  general and administrative expenses at fisher plaza decreased  or  in as compared to due primarily to costs incurred to market fisher plaza for potential buyers during the summer of similar costs were not incurred in as we stopped marketing the sale of fisher plaza in the fourth quarter of total selling  general and administrative expenses at fisher plaza increased in as compared to also due primarily to costs incurred to market fisher plaza to potential buyers during the summer of as of december   and approximately of fisher plaza was occupied or committed for occupancy and  consequently  broad based selling and marketing initiatives have been reduced 
other 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for the other category decreased  or  in as compared to due primarily to the million non recurring non cash charge recognized in for the forfeiture of a non refundable option payment related to our decision not to exercise an option to acquire additional television stations  offset by increases in legal and professional service fees 
the other category incurred higher selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to  due primarily to the non cash charge discussed above  as well as increased legal and professional services fees  retirement plan costs and stock based compensation 
these amounts were partially offset by reduced incentive compensation 
amortization of program rights television 
amortization of program rights for the television segment increased in as compared to  due primarily to the addition of new programs for broadcast on our katu tv and komo tv stations 
amortization of program rights for the television segment increased in as compared to  due primarily to our acquisition of the two bakersfield television stations in radio 
amortization of program rights for the radio segment was related the agreement to broadcast seattle mariners baseball games  which increased slightly in as compared to there was no amortization of program rights in due to the expiration of the mariners agreement in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets based on our annual impairment analysis  we determined that it was not necessary to record an impairment charge in based on the annual impairment test  the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units is greater than the carrying value 
the individual carrying value of a certain reporting unit is within of its estimated fair value  primarily reflecting the impairment charge which reduced goodwill to the then current estimated fair value 
the aggregate carrying value of goodwill at this reporting unit was million at december  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of that included a million impairment to the carrying values of fcc licenses  related to five of our television stations and two of our radio stations  a  impairment to the carrying value of a network affiliation agreement for one of our television stations  and a million impairment to the carrying values of goodwill  related to six reporting units consisting of eleven of our television stations and five of our radio stations 
we tested our fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment at december   between the annual impairment tests  because we believed events had occurred and circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts and that our fcc licenses might be impaired 
these events included a decline in the price of our common stock as of december   the deterioration of overall economic conditions  and the decline in advertising revenues at our radio and television stations 
impairment of investment in equity investee we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of on the investment in our equity investee  south west oregon broadcasting corporation  as part of our fourth quarter impairment review 
plaza fire expenses  net plaza fire expenses  net for the year ended december  represent costs related to the fisher plaza fire  and were comprised of remediation costs of million and loss of fixed assets destroyed by the fire of million  offset by million of insurance reimbursements 
we did not have these costs in or gain on asset exchange  net gain on asset exchange  net was million for the year ended december  this amount represents the substitute equipment received from sprint nextel and the costs of installing the equipment 
upon installation and use of the equipment  the gain net of disposals was recorded 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the asset exchange with sprint nextel 
depreciation and amortization depreciation for the television segment increased in as compared to  due primarily to the fixed asset additions as a result of the sprint nextel asset exchange 
depreciation for the radio segment decreased in as compared to  due primarily to certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
depreciation at fisher plaza declined in as compared to  due to the loss on disposal of fixed assets destroyed in the electrical fire during july this decline was partially offset by the fixed asset replacement expenditures 
depreciation for all segments except fisher plaza increased in as compared to  due primarily to significant television broadcast and information technology additions in depreciation for the fisher plaza segment declined in as compared to  primarily as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
gain on extinguishment of senior notes  net during the year ended december   we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes for total consideration of million in cash plus accrued interest of  a gain on extinguishment of debt was recorded  net of a charge for related unamortized debt issuance costs of  of approximately million 
other income  net other income  net  typically consists of interest and other miscellaneous income received 
in  this included interest income earned on our cash balances  income from the sale of a trademark and other miscellaneous income 
for and  other income  net  includes a gain on the sale of marketable securities  dividends received on marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  interest and miscellaneous income received 
the significant increase in as compared to was due primarily to the june and july sales of our remaining million shares of safeco corporation common stock  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
interest expense interest expense consists primarily of interest on our senior notes and amortization of loan fees 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was due to our repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes during the year ended december  and the fact that we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our million senior credit facility during as the facility was terminated in december the increase in interest expense in as compared to was due primarily to higher interest expense related to borrowings on our million senior credit facility 
this increase in interest expense included  in unamortized transaction costs charged to expense upon our termination of the senior credit facility in december provision benefit for federal and state income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to in as compared to in due primarily to changes in our state tax benefit

liquidity and capital resources liquidity our liquidity is primarily dependent upon our cash and cash equivalents and any short term investments and any net cash from operating activities 
our net cash from operating activities is sensitive to many factors  including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures 
working capital at any specific point in time is dependent upon many variables  including operating results  receivables  capital expenditures  and the timing of cash receipts and payments 
the continued extensive weakening of the us economy and tightening investment and credit markets has had a significant impact on advertising spending by our customers in various categories 
if the current challenging general economic conditions do not improve  we believe that our revenue  cash flow from operations and net income will continue to be negatively impacted and may continue to decline from our revenue and net income levels achieved in due to our high fixed costs  any continued decline in revenue would require us to utilize more of our cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations  working capital requirements and capital expenditures and may require us to delay or forego planned expenditures

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to authoritative guidance on consolidation 
this update addresses the effects on certain provisions of previous accounting guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and concerns about the application of certain key provisions of consolidation guidance  including those in which the accounting and disclosures under the standard do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating impact this update will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which addressed whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting  and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method 
this guidance classifies unvested share based payment grants containing non forfeitable rights to dividends as participating securities that will be included in the computation of earnings per share 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as of december   we had approximately  restricted shares with non forfeitable dividend rights 
the implementation of this authoritative guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
effective january   we adopted the changes issued by the fasb in april that amend the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this guidance requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset 
the guidance also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible asset s expected future cash flows are affected by an entity s intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for the accounting of business combinations 
under the revised guidance  an entity that completes a business combination is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes 
the provisions of the revised authoritative guidance are effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january   with an exception related to the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies related to acquisitions completed before that date 
this new guidance amends the accounting for income taxes to require adjustments  made after the effective date of this statement  to valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and uncertain income tax positions to be recognized as income tax expense 
the adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements in september  which defined fair value  established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued authoritative guidance  which allowed for the delay of the effective date of the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements for one year for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
these include goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets 
the adoption during the first quarter of did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the guidance  which is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   requires fair value disclosures in both interim as well as annual financial statements in order to provide more timely information about the effects of current market conditions on financial instruments 
the implementation of this authoritative guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on management s assessment of subsequent events 
this guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods ending after june  the implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we have evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of our form k for the period ended december  on july   the fasb issued the accounting standards codification asc  generally accepted accounting principles asc 
asc establishes the exclusive authoritative reference for us gaap for use in financial statements for periods ending after september   except for sec rules and interpretive releases  which are also authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the asc supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
as the asc does not change gaap  there was no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the market risk in our consolidated financial instruments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in financial rates 
we are currently exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal funding activities 
interest rate exposure the aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due is at a fixed rate 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
as of december   our fixed rate debt totaled million 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million less than its carrying value 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and  as of december   amounted to approximately million 
fair market values are determined based on market quotes by brokers 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes do not impact book value  operations  or cash flows 
as of december   our fixed rate debt totaled million 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million less than its carrying value 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and  as of december   amounted to approximately million 
marketable securities exposure in  we sold our remaining million shares of safeco corporation common stock 
our investments in safeco represented nearly all of our investments in marketable securities 
accordingly  our exposure to market risk in the area of securities prices was not significant as of december  and was non existent at december
