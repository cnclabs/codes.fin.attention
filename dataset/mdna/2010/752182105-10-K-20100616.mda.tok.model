overview business rand logistics  inc formerly rand acquisition corporation was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  as a blank check company to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of lower lakes towing ltd  a canadian corporation which  with its subsidiary lower lakes transportation company  provides bulk freight shipping services throughout the great lakes region 
as part of the acquisition of lower lakes  we also acquired lower lakes affiliate  grand river navigation company  inc prior to the acquisition  we did not conduct  or have any investment in  any operating business 
in this discussion of rand s business  unless the context otherwise requires  references to rand include rand and its direct and indirect subsidiaries  and references to lower lakes business or the business of lower lakes mean the combined businesses of lower lakes towing  lower lakes transportation and grand river 
rand s shipping business is operated in canada by lower lakes towing and in the united states by lower lakes transportation 
lower lakes towing was organized in march under the laws of canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports in the great lakes that were restricted in their ability to receive larger vessels 
lower lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full service shipping company with a fleet of thirteen cargo carrying vessels  including one vessel which is operated under a contract of affreightment 
from its exclusively canadian beginnings  lower lakes has also grown to offer domestic services to both canadian and us customers as well as cross border routes 
lower lakes services the construction  electric utility and i ntegrated steel industries through the transportation of limestone  coal  iron ore  salt  grain and other dry bulk commodities 
we believe that lower lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port to port services to both canada and the united states in the great lakes region 
lower lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both us and canadian flagged vessels in compliance with the shipping act   and the merchant marine act   commonly referred to as the jones act  in the us and the coasting trade act canada in canada 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  the fiscal year ended march  was highlighted by several significant events as compared to the fiscal year ended march  there was an overall reduction in demand from our customers in the first half of the fiscal year ended march  compared to the first half of the fiscal year ended march  due to the weakened economy and the resultant delayed openings of our customers facilities for the sailing season 
such factors reduced our vessel scheduling flexibility and decreased the overall operating efficiency of our fleet during the first half of the fiscal year ended march  as a result of increasing customer demand in the second half of the fiscal year ended march  and particularly calm weather on the great lakes from october through december  the freight and related revenue and tonnage on the company s owned and operated vessels recovered and exceeded the second half performance of the fiscal year ended m arch  for the fiscal year ended march   freight and related revenue from vessels that we operate nearly matched the results of the fiscal year ended march  accordingly the decline in our overall customer demand for the fiscal year ended march  was primarily limited to our outside voyage charter revenues  including some one time spot market business achieved in the fiscal year ended march  this reduction of outside charter revenues had a lesser impact on our margins 
we partially offset the reduction in overall demand with increased business in our grain and salt cargos 
primarily as a result of the reduced demand from our customers  our total sailing days  which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing  decreased days  or  to  sailing days in the fiscal year ended march  from  sailing days in the fiscal year ended march  due to the repowering and other upgrading completed in june  we operated the saginaw for an additional sailing days in the fiscal year ended march  due to reduced demand from our customers in the first half of the fiscal year ended march   we operated the mckee sons only sailing days in the fiscal year ended march  compared to sailing days in the fiscal year ended march  excluding the saginaw and the mckee sons  we operated our remaining ten canadian and us vessels for additional sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  we benefited from additional new business and contractual rate increases from existing customers during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  all of our customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby the increases or decreases in our fuel costs are passed on to customers 
such increases or decreases in fuel surcharges impact our margin percentages  but do not significantly impact our margin dollars 
due to reduced fuel prices during the fiscal year ended march   fuel surcharge revenues declined sharply as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the canadian dollar strengthened by approximately versus the us dollar  averaging approximately usd per cdn during the fiscal year ended march  compared to approximately usd per cdn during the fiscal year ended march  however  freight and related revenue and vessel operating expenses were impacted by a slightly weaker average canadian dollar during the actual sailing season 
the company s balance sheet translation rate increased from usd per cdn at march  to usd per cdn at march  selected financial information usd in s fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change revenue freight and related revenue fuel and other surcharges outside voyage charter revenue total expenses outside voyage charter fees vessel operating expenses repairs and maintenance sailing days per day in whole usd revenue per sailing day freight and related revenue fuel and other surcharges expenses per sailing day vessel operating expenses repairs and maintenance management believes that each of our vessels should achieve approximately sailing days in an average great lakes season assuming no major repairs or incidents and normal drydocking cycle times performed during the winter lay up period 
the company s vessels sailed an average of approximately sailing days during each of the fiscal years ended march  and march  the following table summarizes the changes in the components of our revenue and vessel operating expenses as a result of changes in sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  usd in s sailing days freight and related revenue fuel and other surcharges outside voyage charter total revenue vessel operating expenses fiscal year ended march  changes in fiscal year ended march  decrease attributable to weaker canadian dollar net increase decrease attributable to customer demand and pricing excluding currency impact changes in outside voyage charter revenue excluding currency impact sub total fiscal year ended march  total revenue during the fiscal year ended march  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower fuel surcharges and reduced customer demand  which primarily impacted outside voyage charter revenue 
freight and other related revenue generated from the company s owned vessels decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  freight and related revenue per sailing day decreased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was a result of a weaker average canadian dollar and less efficient trade patterns in the first half of the sailing season  partially offset by price increases 
fuel and other surcharges decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  fuel and other surcharges per sailing day decreased  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  outside voyage charter revenues decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in outside voyage charter revenues was due to reduced overall demand from the company s customers  including some one time spot market business  during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march   which decrease was primarily attributable to reduced fuel costs due to lower fuel prices  and to a lesser extent cost reductions achieved by the company during the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses per sailing day decreased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance expenses  which consist of expensed winter work  increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance per sailing day increased to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was caused by the much stronger canadian dollar in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  our general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was a result of cost reductions  partially offset by a loan amendment fee of in the year ended march  our general and administrative expenses represented of revenues during the fiscal year ended march   an increase from of revenues during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   million of our general and administrative expenses was attributable to our parent company and million was attributable to our opera ting companies 
depreciation expense rose million to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in depreciation expense was attributable to capital expenditures incurred during the winter lay up as well as a full year of depreciation of the investment in the saginaw repowering  which was completed in june amortization of drydock costs increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  due to the drydocking of one vessel during the winter layup period 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company amortized the deferred drydock costs of seven of its twelve vessels compared to six vessels during the fiscal year ended march  amortization of intangibles decreased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  due to reduced amortization of acquired non competition agreements which were fully amortized as of march  as a result of the items described above  during the fiscal year ended march   the company s operating income decreased million to million compared to operating income of million during the fiscal year ended march  interest expense decreased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  this decrease in interest expense was attributable to a lower average debt balance as compared to the fiscal year ended march  and the expiration of interest rate swap coverage of a portion of our canadian long term debt during the fiscal year ended march  we recorded a gain on interest rate swap contracts of million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to a loss of million incurred in the fiscal year ended march  due to company s recording the fair value of our two interest rate swap agreements  which were signed in connection with the execution of our amended and restated credit agreement 
our income before income taxes was million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to income before income taxes of in the fiscal year ended march  our provision for income tax expense was million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to a provision for income tax expense of million during the fiscal year ended march  the company recorded a million valuation allowance against its us federal net deferred assets during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  due to taxable net operating losses for the prior three fiscal years 
our net income before preferred stock dividends was million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million in the fiscal year ended march  we accrued million for cash dividends on our preferred stock during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the dividends accrued at a rate of during the three month period ended march  when the dividends are not paid in cash  the rate increases every six months to a cap of  and will increase to effective july   assuming cash dividends have not yet been paid 
our net income applicable to common stockholders was million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to a loss of million during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company operated an average of approximately vessels in the us and vessels in canada 
the percentage of our total freight and other revenue  fuel and other surcharge revenue  vessel operating expenses  repairs and maintenance costs  and combined depreciation and amortization costs  approximate the percentage of vessel ownership by country 
our outside voyage charter revenue and costs relate solely to our canadian subsidiary and approximately of our general and administrative costs are incurred in canada 
approximately two thirds of our interest expense is incurred in canada  consistent with our percentage of overall indebtedness by country 
approximately of our gain on interest rate swap contracts was realized in canada based on the larger amount of indebtedness and greater increase of interest rates in canada than in the us during the fiscal year ended march  in addition  substantially all of our million of tax provision was incurred in canada during the fiscal year ended march  all of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the us 
impact of inflation and changing prices during the fiscal year ended march   there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs 
however  our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges 
in addition  there was significant volatility in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar during the past two fiscal years  which impacted our translation of revenue and costs to us dollars by a reduction of approximately during the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations  the proceeds of our credit facility and proceeds from sales of our common stock 
our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions  capital expenditures  drydock expenditures  operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facility 
information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows categorized by operating  investing and financing activities which is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and march  we believe cash generated from our operations and availability of borrowing under our credit facility will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if the company experiences a material shortfall to its financial forecasts or if the company s customers materially delay their receivable payments due to further deterioration of economic conditions  the company may breach its financial covenants and collateral thresholds and be strained for liquidity 
the company has maintained its focus on productivity gains and cost controls  and is closely monitoring customer credit and accounts receivable balances 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to higher cash earnings in the fiscal year ended march  combined with the timing of the payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the balance sheet  which were higher at the beginning of the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the sum of net income and adjustments to reconcile with net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  including million of equity compensation  offset by deferred drydock costs paid of million and net cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
 during the fiscal year ended march   the sum of net income plus adjustments to reconcile with net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  including million of equity compensation  offset by deferred drydock costs paid of million and net cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the company did not incur any significant bad debt write offs or material slowdowns in receivable collections during the fiscal year ended march  the timing of the end of the company s fiscal year in relation to the sailing season allows most of a sailing season s receivables to be collected prior to the end of the company s fiscal year 
in addition  the earlier start of a sailing season prior to april  can modestly increase the amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable in the company s balance sheet at the end of our fiscal year 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million to net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  our capital expenditures decreased million due to higher capital expenditures accrued and paid in the first half of the fiscal year ended march  carryover from winter as compared to the capital expenditures accrued and paid in the first half of the fiscal year ended march  carryover from winter  offset by of proceeds from the scrap sale of a vessel during the fiscal year ended march  cash used in financing activities increased million to million used during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million provided in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company made a net paydown of its revolving credit facility of million compared to net borrowings under its revolving credit facility of million in the fiscal year ended march  the company made principal payments on its term debt of million during the fiscal year ended march   which was million higher than the million of principal payments on its term debt paid in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   long term debt  including the current portion  increased million to million from million in the fiscal year ending march   which reflected million in scheduled principal payments  offset by a million increase attributable to the higher currency translation of our canadian debt into us dollars at march  our amended and restated credit agreement  as amended  requires the company to meet certain quarterly and annual financial covenants  including minimum ebitda as defined therein  minimum fixed charge ratios  maximum senior debt to ebitda ratios  and maximum capital expenditures and drydock expenditures 
the company met those financial covenants during the fiscal year ended march  the covenants are set in canadian dollars in order to better match the cash earnings and debt levels of the business by currency 
on june   lower lakes  lower lakes transportation  grand river and the other credit parties thereto entered into a second amendment the amendment  to the amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of february   with the lenders signatory thereto and general electric capital corporation  as agent 
under the amendment  the parties amended the definitions of fixed charge coverage ratio  fixed charges  funded debt and working capital  modified the maximum amounts outstanding under the canadian and us seasonal overadvance facilities and modified the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and the maximum senior funded debt to ebitda ratio 
seasonality lower lakes operates in a cyclical industry  primarily due to the typical cold weather patterns on the great lakes from december through march which cause lock closures  waterway ice  and customer facility closings  which typically shut down shipping for a period of up to days commencing from late december to mid january  and continuing until late march 
lower lakes also experiences a cyclical pattern for its capital spending cycle  typically off season from the shipping revenues  to permit annual maintenance and investment in the vessels 
this places additional adverse pressures on lower lakes liquidity and capital resources 
such winter work  capital expenditure  and drydocking costs are incurred during a period when customer collections have ended from the prior season  and fit out and vessel operating costs will be incur red at the beginning of the season as much as to days prior to the receipt of significant customer collections 
to counter these negative working capital cycles  lower lakes amended and restated credit facility includes a revolver feature with a seasonal overadvance facility which provides working capital from the march through july period  after which customer collections typically exceed cash disbursements 
preferred stock and preferred stock dividends the company has accrued  but not paid  its preferred stock dividends since january  the shares of the series a convertible preferred stock rank senior to the company s common stock with respect to liquidation and dividends  are entitled to receive a cash dividend at the annual rate of based on the per share issue price  payable quarterly subject to increases of for each six month period in respect of which the dividend is not paid in cash  up to a maximum of  subject to reversion to upon payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends  are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at any time at the option of the series a preferred stockholder at a conversion price of per share based on the per share issue price and subject to adjustment or shares of common stock for each series a preferred share subject to adjustment  are convertible into shares of the company s common stock based on a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment at the option of the company if  after the third anniversary of our acquisition of lower lakes  the trading price of the company s common stock for trading days within any trading day period equals or exceeds per share subject to adjustment  may be redeemed by the company in connection with certain change of control or acquisition transactions  will vote on an as converted basis with the company s common stock  and have a separate vote over certain material transactions or changes involving the company 
the accrued dividend payable at march  was million  and at march  was million 
as of march   the effective rate of preferred dividends was as of march  
the dividend rate will increase to effective july  if the dividend is not paid in cash and will increase every six months thereafter until it reaches or the accrued dividends are paid in cash 
the company is limited in the payment of preferred stock dividends by the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the company s amended and restated credit agreement 
in addition  the company has made the decision to make its investments in vessels before applying cash to pay preferred stock dividends 
under the terms of the preferred stock  upon the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock  a subordinated promissory note will be issued whereby the cash dividends will accrue at the rates set for the preferred stock and the note must be paid at the earlier of the second anniversary of the conversion  or seven years from the initial issuance date of the preferred stock  whichever is earlier 
investments in capital expenditures and drydockings we incurred million in paid and unpaid capital expenditures and drydock expenses during the fiscal year ended march   including million relating to carryover from the winter season  compared to million  including a carryover of million from the winter season  in the fiscal year ended march  our capital expenditures and drydock expenses paid or accrued for the winter season were million for the fiscal year ended march we are currently evaluating the merits of financing the repowering of our canadian flagged michipicoten vessel with a new highly automated emissions compliant power plant at a cost of approximately million  which would improve margins due to higher speed and reduced operating cost 
foreign exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposure related to the currency related translation of various financial instruments denominated in the canadian dollar fair value risk and operating cash flows denominated in the canadian dollar cash flow risk 
these exposures are associated with period to period changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
at march   our liability for financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately cdn million of term borrowings in canada and there was no balance of revolving borrowings in canada 
although we have tried to match our indebtedness and cash flows from earnings by country  a sudden increase in the canadian dollar exchange rates could increase the indebtedness converted to us dollars before operating cash flow s can make up for such a currency conversion change 
from a cash flow perspective  our operations are insulated against changes in currency rates as operations in canada and the united states have revenues and expenditures denominated in local currencies and our operations are cash flow positive 
however  as stated above  the majority of our financial liabilities are denominated in canadian dollars which exposes us to currency risks related to principal payments and interest payments on such financial liability instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates associated with revolving our indebtedness under our amended and restated credit agreement  which carries interest rates which vary with canadian prime rates and ba rates for canadian borrowings  and us prime rates and libor rates on us borrowings 
we entered into two interest rate swap contracts for approximately of our term loans for the remaining term of such loans based on three month ba rates for the canadian term loans and three month us libor rates for the us term loans 
the rates on these instruments  prior to the addition of the lender s margin  are on the canadian term loans  and on the us term loans 
we will be exposed to interest rate risk under our interest rate swap contracts if such contracts are required to be amended or terminated earlier than their termination dates 
off balance sheet arrangements on august   in connection with the coa and option agreement  lower lakes entered into a guarantee with ge canada the guarantee  pursuant to which lower lakes agreed to guarantee up to cdn million the guaranteed obligations of voyageur s indebtedness to ge canada 
lower lakes maximum future payments under the guarantee are limited to the guaranteed obligations plus the costs and expenses ge canada incurs while enforcing its rights under the guarantee 
lower lakes obligations under the guarantee shall become due should voyageur fail to meet certain financial covenants under the terms of its loan from ge canada or if voyageur breaches certain of its obligations under the coa 
lower lakes has several options available to it in the event that ge canada intends to draw under the guarantee  including i t he right to exercise its option for the trader under the option agreement and ii the right to make a subordinated secured loan to voyageur in an amount at least equal to the amount intended to be drawn by ge canada on terms as are reasonably satisfactory to ge canada and voyageur 
voyageur has been determined to be a variable interest entity of the company under us gaap 
rand has determined that it is not a primary beneficiary of voyageur s remaining business and therefore rand is not required to consolidate voyageur s financial statements 
critical accounting policies rand s significant accounting policies are presented in note to its audited consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates revenues from freight billings under contracts of affreightment voyage charters generally on a rate per ton basis based on origin destination and cargo carried 
voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period when the following conditions are met the company has a signed contract of affreightment  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
included in freight billings are other fees such as fuel surcharges and other freight surcharges  which represent pass through charges to customers for toll fees  lockage fees and ice breaking fees paid to other parties 
fuel surcharges are recognized over the duration of the voyage  while freight surcharges are recognized when the assoc iated costs are incurred 
freight surcharges are less than of total revenue 
the company subcontracts excess customer demand to other freight providers 
service to customers under such arrangements is transparent to the customer and no additional services are provided to customers 
consequently  revenues recognized for customers serviced by freight subcontractors are recognized on the same basis as described above 
costs for subcontracted freight providers  presented as outside voyage charter fees on the consolidated statement of operations are recognized as incurred and are thereby recognized ratably over the voyage 
in addition  all revenues are presented on a gross basis 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  financing costs  trademarks  trade names  non competition agreements and customer relationships and contracts 
other intangibles are amortized as follows trademarks and trade names years straight line non competition agreements years straight line customer relationships and contracts years straight line non competition agreements are amortized over the period which consists of the remainder of the employment contract and the non compete period after its expiration 
although customer contracts have a typical duration of only three to five years  the company has experienced a consistent track record of serial renewals by its significant contract customers and such customers comprise most of the company s business 
the company s customer relationships are fortified by the fact that there are a limited number of great lakes shipping companies as well as a declining number of vessels operating on the great lakes 
the company has an additional advantage in that it operates half of the vessels on the great lakes which are classified as river class vessels and capable of accessing docks and customers not accessible to larger vessels 
accordingly  customers have a substantial interest in protecting their great lakes transportation relationships 
based on the foregoing  and in compliance with sfas  the company has determined that years is the most appropriate best estimate amortization period for its customer relationships and contracts 
the company has estimated a year useful life for its trademarks and trade names 
in accordance with asc determining the life of an intangible asset  since the company cannot reliably determine the pattern of economic benefit of the use of the customer relationships and trademarks and trade names  the company has determined that the straight line amortization is appropriate 
deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related debt  which approximates the effective interest method 
impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets with finite lives fixed assets and finite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs 
examples of such triggering events include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets  an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulties or delays in integrating the business  and a significant change in the operations of an acquired business 
the company has determined that there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that could affect the valuation of our assets during the fiscal year ended march  impairment of goodwill as of march   the company made its annual test of goodwill 
significant assumptions are inherent in this process  including estimates of our undiscounted cash flows  discount rates  comparable companies and comparable transactions 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets 
the company presently has no intangible assets not subject to amortization other than goodwill 
the fair market values of each of our reporting units exceeded the sum of the carrying values of those reporting units at march  income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recognized  if necessary  to measure tax benefits to the extent that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
the determination to set up a valuation allowance is dependent on management s estimates of whether taxable income in future periods for each taxable entity is sufficient that deferred income tax assets will be realized  except for the change in foreign exchange loss  based on the performance of the entity and the expected timing of the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities  and tax net operating losses in particular entities in recent years 
such management estimates are subject to uncertainty 
the company has adopted the accounting guidance related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective april  which addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under such guidance  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
establishing accruals for tax benefits requires management to make estimates and assessments w ith respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audit issues if any and amounts recorded on financial statements 
the ultimate resolution of such uncertain tax benefits may differ from management s estimate  potentially impacting the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
however  the impact of the company s reassessment of its tax positions did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
stock based compensation the company has adopted asc compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective method 
this method requires compensation cost to be recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of asc for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date 
under this method  the company recognizes compensation expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after april  compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding at april  is recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period based on the fair value at date of grant 
recently issued pronouncements the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued asc generally accepted accounting principles 
the objective of asc is to establish the fasb accounting standards codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the company adopted asc on september   which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
fair value measurements in april  the fasb amended asc  fair value measurement and disclosures overall 
asc provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have decreased significantly 
asc also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
asc is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the company adopted asc in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended march  and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  an amendment to asc  fair value measurements and disclosures overall  for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
asu provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using certain other valuation techniques 
the guidance provided in asu is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
the company adopted asu as of october  asu had no impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update requires additional disclosure within the roll forward of activity for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  including transfers of assets and liabilities between level and level of the fair value hierarchy and the separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of assets and liabilities within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in addition  the update requires enhanced disclosures of the valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements within levels and the new disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the discl osure of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as asu only requires enhanced disclosures  the company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements on december   the fasb issued asc consolidation overall transition and open effective date information 
asc requires entities to report non controlling minority interests of consolidated subsidiaries as a component of stockholders equity on the balance sheet  include all earnings of a consolidated subsidiary in consolidated results of operations  and treat all transactions between an entity and the non controlling interest as equity transactions between the parties 
asc applies to all fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company adopted this standard as of april   however  the company does not have any partially owned subsidiaries to consolidate and therefore the application o f this standard had no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in march  the fasb issued asc derivatives and hedging
