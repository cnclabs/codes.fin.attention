item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on rna interference  or rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes 
since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes  the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases 
we believe that drugs that work through rnai have the potential to become a broad new class of drugs  like small molecule  protein and antibody drugs 
using our intellectual property and the expertise we have built in rnai  we are developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know how that we apply in a systematic way to develop rnai therapeutics for a variety of diseases 
we are applying our technological expertise to build a pipeline of rnai therapeutics to address significant medical needs  many of which cannot effectively be addressed with small molecules or antibodies  the current major classes of drugs 
we are working to develop rnai therapeutics that are delivered directly to specific sites of disease  as well as rnai therapeutics that are administered systemically through the bloodstream by intravenous  subcutaneous or intramuscular approaches 
our lead rnai therapeutic program  aln rsv  is in phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of human respiratory syncytial virus  or rsv  infection  which is reported to be the leading cause of hospitalization in infants in the united states and also occurs in the elderly and in immune compromised adults 
in february  we reported positive results from our phase ii experimental rsv infection clinical trial  referred to as the gemini study 
in july  we and cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  or cubist  reported results from a phase iia clinical trial assessing the safety and tolerability of aerosolized aln rsv versus placebo in adult lung transplant patients naturally infected with rsv 
in february  we initiated a multi center  global  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase iib clinical trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy endpoints  as well as safety of aerosolized aln rsv in adult lung transplant patients naturally infected with rsv 
we have formed collaborations with cubist and kyowa hakko kirin co  ltd  or kyowa hakko kirin  for the development and commercialization of rnai products for rsv 
we have an agreement to jointly develop and commercialize certain rnai products for rsv with cubist in north america 
cubist has responsibility for developing and commercializing any such products in the rest of the world outside of asia  and kyowa hakko kirin has the responsibility for developing and commercializing any rnai products for rsv in asia 
in november  we and cubist agreed that alnylam would move forward with the development of aln rsv  and together we would focus our collaboration and joint development efforts on aln rsv  a second generation compound  intended for use in pediatric patients 
we and cubist each bears one half of the related development costs for aln rsv we are also continuing to develop aln rsv for adult transplant patients at our sole discretion and expense 
cubist has the right to resume the collaboration on aln rsv in the future  which right may be exercised for a specified period of time following the completion of our phase iib trial of aln rsv  subject to the payment by cubist of an opt in fee representing reimbursement of an agreed upon percentage of certain of our development expenses for aln rsv in march  we initiated a phase i study for aln vsp  our second clinical program and our first systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate 
we are developing aln vsp for the treatment of liver cancers  including hepatocellular carcinoma  or hcc  and other solid tumors with liver involvement 
the phase i study is a multi center  open label  dose escalation study to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous aln vsp in up to approximately patients with advanced solid tumors with liver involvement  including hcc 
in december  we filed regulatory applications to initiate a clinical trial for aln ttr  our second systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate 
we are developing aln ttr  which targets the transthyretin  or ttr  gene  for the treatment of ttr mediated amyloidosis  or attr 
we plan to initiate a phase i trial of aln ttr in attr patients in the first half of aln ttr employs a first generation lipid nanoparticle  or lnp  formulation 
in parallel  we are also advancing aln ttr utilizing second generation lnps 

table of contents in january  we announced that we expect aln pcs  a systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  to be our next clinical candidate 
aln pcs targets a gene called proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type  or pcsk we are also working on a number of programs in pre clinical development  including aln htt  an rnai therapeutic candidate targeting the huntingtin gene  for the treatment of huntington s disease  or hd  which we are developing in collaboration with medtronic  inc  or medtronic 
we have additional discovery programs for rnai therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases 
in addition  we are working internally and with third party collaborators to develop capabilities to deliver our rnai therapeutics directly to specific sites of disease  such as the delivery of aln rsv to the lungs 
we are also working to extend our capabilities to advance the development of rnai therapeutics that are administered systemically by intravenous  subcutaneous or intramuscular approaches 
over the past to months  we have made several of what we believe to be major advances relating to the delivery of rnai therapeutics  both internally and together with our collaborators 
we have numerous rnai therapeutic delivery collaborations and intend to continue to collaborate with government  academic and corporate third parties to evaluate different delivery options 
we rely on the strength of our intellectual property portfolio relating to the development and commercialization of small interfering rnas  or sirnas  as therapeutics 
this includes ownership of  or exclusive rights to  issued patents and pending patent applications claiming fundamental features of sirnas and rnai therapeutics as well as those claiming crucial chemical modifications and promising delivery technologies 
we believe that no other company possesses a portfolio of such broad and exclusive rights to the patents and patent applications required for the commercialization of rnai therapeutics 
given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations  we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise in this area 
in addition  our expertise in rnai therapeutics and broad intellectual property estate have allowed us to form alliances with leading companies  including isis pharmaceuticals  inc  or isis  medtronic  novartis pharma ag  or novartis  biogen idec inc  or biogen idec  f 
hoffmann la roche ltd  or roche  takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda  kyowa hakko kirin and cubist 
we have also entered into contracts with government agencies  including the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid  a component of the national institutes of health  or nih 
we have established collaborations with and  in some instances  received funding from major medical and disease associations 
finally  to further enable the field and monetize our intellectual property rights  we also grant licenses to biotechnology companies for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest under our interferx tm program and to research companies that commercialize rnai reagents or services under our research product licenses 
we also seek opportunities to form new ventures in areas outside our core strategic focus 
for example  during  we presented new data regarding the application of rnai technology to improve the manufacturing processes for biologics  which is comprised of recombinant proteins  monoclonal antibodies and vaccines 
this initiative  which we are advancing in an internal effort referred to as alnylam biotherapeutics  has the potential to create new business opportunities 
additionally  in  we and isis established regulus therapeutics inc  formerly regulus therapeutics llc  or regulus  a company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of microrna based therapeutics 
because micrornas are believed to regulate whole networks of genes that can be involved in discrete disease processes  microrna based therapeutics represent a possible new approach to target the pathways of human disease 
given the broad applications for rnai technology  we believe additional opportunities exist for new ventures 
alnylam commenced operations in june we have focused our efforts since inception primarily on business planning  research and development  acquiring  filing and expanding intellectual property rights  recruiting management and technical staff  and raising capital 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
through december   we have funded our operations primarily through the net proceeds from the sale of equity securities and payments we have received under strategic alliances 
through december   a substantial portion of our total net revenues have been collaboration revenues derived from our strategic alliances with roche  
table of contents takeda and novartis  and from the united states government in connection with our development of treatments for hemorrhagic fever viruses  including ebola 
we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from new and existing strategic alliances  government and foundation funding  and license fee revenues 
we currently have programs focused in a number of therapeutic areas 
however  we are unable to predict when  if ever  we will successfully develop or be able to commence sales of any product 
we have never achieved profitability on an annual basis and we expect to incur additional losses over the next several years 
we expect our net losses to continue due primarily to research and development activities relating to our drug development programs  collaborations and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
therefore  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
our sources of potential funding for the next several years are expected to be derived primarily from payments under new and existing strategic alliances  which may include license and other fees  funded research and development payments and milestone payments  government and foundation funding  and proceeds from the sale of equity 
research and development since our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs 
research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses 
our most advanced program is focused on the treatment of rsv infection and is in phase ii clinical studies 
in march  we initiated a phase i study for aln vsp  our second clinical program and our first systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate for the treatment of primary and secondary liver cancer 
in december  we filed regulatory applications to initiate a clinical trial for aln ttr  our second systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate 
we are developing aln ttr  which targets the ttr gene  for the treatment of attr 
we plan to initiate a phase i trial of aln ttr in attr patients in the first half of aln ttr employs a first generation lnp formulation 
in parallel  we are also advancing aln ttr utilizing second generation lnps 
in january  we announced that we expect aln pcs  a systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  to be our next clinical candidate 
we also have a development program focused on the treatment of hd 
in addition  we have discovery programs to develop rnai therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases  such as viral hemorrhagic fever  including the ebola virus  parkinson s disease  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  or pml  and other undisclosed programs  as well as several other diseases that are the subject of our strategic alliances 
we are working internally and with third party collaborators to develop capabilities to deliver our rnai therapeutics both directly to the specific sites of disease and systemically  and we intend to continue to collaborate with government  academic and corporate third parties to evaluate different delivery options 
there is a risk that any drug discovery or development program may not produce revenue for a variety of reasons  including the possibility that we will not be able to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate 
moreover  there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery  including rnai 
the successful development of any product candidate we develop is highly uncertain 
due to the numerous risks associated with developing drugs  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows will commence from  any potential product candidate 
these risks include the uncertainty of our ability to progress product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  including those related to developing safe and effective ways of delivering sirnas into cells and tissues  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms  timing and success of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  
table of contents the cost  timing and success of regulatory filings and approvals or potential changes in regulations that govern our industry or the way in which they are interpreted or enforced  the cost and timing of establishing sufficient sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost and timing of establishing sufficient clinical and commercial supplies of any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and the potential consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
strategic alliances a significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  research foundations and others  as appropriate  to gain access to funding  capabilities  technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts and to generate revenues 
our collaboration strategy is to form non exclusive platform alliances where our collaborators obtain access to our capabilities and intellectual property to develop their own rnai therapeutic products  and co development and or ex us market geographic partnerships on specific rnai therapeutic programs 
we have entered into broad  non exclusive platform license agreements with roche and takeda  under which we are also collaborating with each of roche and takeda on rnai drug discovery for one or more disease targets 
we are pursuing co development programs with cubist and medtronic for the development and commercialization of aln rsv and aln htt  respectively 
in addition  we have entered into a product alliance with kyowa hakko kirin for the development and commercialization of aln rsv in territories not covered by the cubist agreement  which include japan and other markets in asia 
we also have discovery and development alliances with isis  novartis and biogen idec 
we also seek opportunities to form new ventures in areas outside our core strategic focus 
for example  during  we established alnylam biotherapeutics  an internal effort regarding the application of rnai technology to improve the manufacturing processes for biologics  an approach that has the potential to create new business opportunities 
this initiative is focused on applying rnai technologies to the biologics marketplace  which is comprised of recombinant proteins  monoclonal antibodies  and vaccines 
in addition  during  we formed regulus  together with isis  to capitalize on our technology and intellectual property in the field of microrna based therapeutics 
given the broad applications for rnai technology  we believe additional opportunities exist for new ventures 
to generate revenues from our intellectual property rights  we grant licenses to biotechnology companies under our interferx program for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest 
we also license key aspects of our intellectual property to companies active in the research products and services market  which includes the manufacture and sale of reagents 
our interferx and research product licenses aim to generate modest near term revenues that we can re invest in the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline 
as of january   we had granted such licenses  on both an exclusive and non exclusive basis  to approximately companies 
since delivery of rnai therapeutics remains a major objective of our research activities  we also look to form collaboration and licensing agreements with other companies and academic institutions to gain access to delivery technologies 
for example  we have entered into agreements with tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation  or tekmira  the massachusetts institute of technology  or mit  the university of british columbia  or ubc  and alcana technologies  inc  or alcana  among others  to focus on various delivery strategies 
we have also entered into license agreements with isis  max planck innovation gmbh  tekmira and mit  as well as a number of other entities  to obtain rights to important intellectual property in the field of rnai 
in april  we established a new collaboration with isis focused on the development of single stranded rnai  or ssrnai  technology 

table of contents additionally  we seek funding for the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline from the government and foundations 
in  niaid awarded us a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic against hemorrhagic fever virus  including the ebola virus 
in  the defense threat reduction agency  or dtra  an agency of the united states department of defense  awarded us a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic for hemorrhagic fever virus  which contract ended in february in addition  we have obtained funding for pre clinical discovery programs from organizations such as the michael j 
fox foundation 
in september  we terminated our amended and restated research collaboration and license agreement with merck co  inc  or merck 
pursuant to the termination agreement  all license grants of intellectual property to develop  manufacture and or commercialize rnai therapeutic products under the amended and restated research collaboration and license agreement ceased as of the date of the termination agreement  subject to certain specified exceptions 
the termination agreement further provides that  subject to certain conditions  we and merck will each retain sole ownership and rights in our own intellectual property 
platform alliances 
roche 
in july  we and  for limited purposes  alnylam europe ag  or alnylam europe  entered into a license and collaboration agreement with roche 
under the license and collaboration agreement  which became effective in august  we granted roche a non exclusive license to our intellectual property to develop and commercialize therapeutic products that function through rnai  subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
the license is initially limited to the therapeutic areas of oncology  respiratory diseases  metabolic diseases and certain liver diseases  and may be expanded to include up to additional therapeutic areas  comprising substantially all other fields of human disease  as identified and agreed upon by the parties  upon payment to us by roche of an additional million for each additional therapeutic area  if any 
in consideration for the rights granted to roche under the license and collaboration agreement  roche paid us million in upfront cash payments 
in addition  in exchange for our contributions under the collaboration agreement  for each rnai therapeutic product developed by roche  its affiliates or sublicensees under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of specified development and sales events  totaling up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic target  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from roche 
under the license and collaboration agreement  we and roche also agreed to collaborate on the discovery of rnai therapeutic products directed to one or more disease targets  subject to our contractual obligations to third parties 
in october  we and roche advanced our alliance to initiate this therapeutic collaboration stage  referred to as the discovery collaboration 
under the discovery collaboration  we and roche are collaborating on the discovery and development of specific rnai therapeutic products and each party contributes key delivery technologies in the effort  which is focused on specific disease targets 
we and roche intend to co develop and co commercialize rnai therapeutic products in the us market and we are eligible to receive additional milestone and royalty payments for products developed in the rest of the world  if any 
after a pre specified period of collaborative activities  each party will have the option to opt out of the day to day development activities in exchange for reduced milestones and royalty payments in the future 
the discovery collaboration is governed by the joint steering committee that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
in connection with the execution of the license and collaboration agreement  we executed a common stock purchase agreement with roche finance ltd  or roche finance  an affiliate of roche 
under the terms of the common stock purchase agreement  in august  roche finance purchased  shares of our common stock at per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in connection with the execution of the license and collaboration agreement and the common stock purchase agreement  we also executed a stock purchase agreement with alnylam europe and roche beteiligungs gmbh  or roche germany  an affiliate of roche 
under the terms of the alnylam europe stock purchase agreement  we created a new  wholly owned german limited liability company  roche kulmbach  into which substantially all of 
table of contents the non intellectual property assets of alnylam europe were transferred  and roche germany purchased from us all of the issued and outstanding shares of roche kulmbach for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the alnylam europe stock purchase agreement included transition services that were performed by roche kulmbach employees at various levels through august we reimbursed roche for these services at an agreed upon rate 
in connection with the license and collaboration agreement and the common stock purchase agreement  during  we paid million in license fees to our licensors  primarily isis  in accordance with the applicable license agreements with those parties 
these fees were charged to research and development expense 
takeda 
in may  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with takeda to pursue the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics 
under the takeda agreement  we granted to takeda a non exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license to our intellectual property to develop  manufacture  use and commercialize rnai therapeutics  subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
the license initially is limited to the fields of oncology and metabolic disease and may be expanded at takeda s option to include other therapeutic areas  subject to specified conditions 
under the takeda agreement  takeda will be our exclusive platform partner in the asian territory  as defined in the agreement  for a period of five years 
in consideration for the rights granted to takeda under the takeda agreement  takeda agreed to pay us million in upfront and near term technology transfer payments 
in addition  we have the option  exercisable until the start of phase iii development  to opt in under a profit sharing agreement to the development and commercialization in the united states of up to four takeda licensed products  and would be entitled to opt in rights for two additional products for each additional field expansion  if any  elected by takeda under the takeda agreement 
in june  takeda paid us an upfront payment of million 
takeda is also required to make the additional million in payments to us upon achievement of specified technology transfer milestones  million of which was achieved in september and paid in october  million of which is due upon achievement of specified technology transfer activities  but no later than may  and million of which is due upon the achievement of specified technology transfer activities within to months after execution of the agreement 
if takeda elects to expand its license to additional therapeutic areas  takeda will be required to pay us million for each of up to approximately total additional fields selected  if any  comprising substantially all other fields of human disease  as identified and agreed upon by the parties 
in addition  for each rnai therapeutic product developed by takeda  its affiliates and sublicensees  we are entitled to receive specified development and commercialization milestones  totaling up to million per product  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from takeda 
pursuant to the takeda agreement  we and takeda are also collaborating on the research of rnai therapeutics directed to one or two disease targets agreed to by the parties  subject to our existing contractual obligations with third parties 
takeda also has the option  subject to certain conditions  to collaborate with us on the research and development of rnai drug delivery technology for targets agreed to by the parties 
in addition  takeda has a right of first negotiation for the development and commercialization of our rnai therapeutic products in the asian territory  excluding our aln rsv program 
in addition to our profit sharing option  we have a similar right of first negotiation to participate with takeda in the development and commercialization in the united states of licensed products 
the collaboration is governed by a joint technology transfer committee  or jttc  a joint research collaboration committee  or jrcc  and a joint delivery collaboration committee  or jdcc  each of which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
in connection with the takeda agreement  during  we paid million of license fees to our licensors  primarily isis  in accordance with the applicable license agreements with those parties 
these fees were charged to research and development expense 
discovery and development alliances 
isis 
in april  we and isis amended and restated our existing strategic collaboration and license agreement  originally entered into in march  to extend the broad cross licensing arrangement regarding double stranded rnai that was established in  pursuant to which isis granted us licenses to its current and 
table of contents future patents and patent applications relating to chemistry and to rna targeting mechanisms for the research  development and commercialization of double stranded rna  or dsrna products 
we have the right to use isis technologies in our development programs or in collaborations  and isis has agreed not to grant licenses under these patents to any other organization for the discovery  development or commercialization of dsrna products designed to work through an rnai mechanism  except in the context of a collaboration in which isis plays an active role 
we granted isis non exclusive licenses to our current and future patents and patent applications relating to rna targeting mechanisms and to chemistry for research use 
we also granted isis the non exclusive right to develop and commercialize dsrna products developed using rnai technology against a limited number of targets 
in addition  we granted isis non exclusive rights to research  develop and commercialize single stranded rna products 
we agreed to pay isis milestone payments  totaling up to approximately million  upon the occurrence of specified development and regulatory events  and royalties on sales  if any  for each product that we or a collaborator develops using isis intellectual property 
in addition  we agreed to pay to isis a percentage of specified fees from strategic collaborations we may enter into that include access to the isis intellectual property 
isis agreed to pay us  per therapeutic target  a license fee of million  and milestone payments totaling approximately million  payable upon the occurrence of specified development and regulatory events  and royalties on sales  if any  for each product developed by isis or a collaborator that utilizes our intellectual property 
isis has the right to elect up to ten non exclusive target licenses under the agreement and has the right to purchase one additional non exclusive target per year during the term of the collaboration 
as part of the amended and restated isis agreement  we and isis established a new collaborative effort focused on the development of ssrnai technology 
under the amended and restated isis agreement  we obtained from isis a co exclusive  worldwide license to isis current and future patents and patent applications relating to chemistry and rna targeting mechanisms to research  develop and commercialize ssrnai products 
each party has the opportunity to discover and develop drugs employing the ssrnai technology 
under the terms of the amended and restated isis agreement  we will potentially pay isis up to an aggregate of million in license fees  payable in four tranches  that include million paid on signing  million payable in october  or if and when in vivo efficacy in rodents is demonstrated if sooner  million upon achievement of in vivo efficacy in non human primates  and million upon initiation of the first clinical trial with an ssrnai drug  subject to our right to unilaterally terminate the research program 
we are funding research activities at a minimum of million each year for three years with research and development activities conducted by both us and isis 
if we develop and commercialize drugs utilizing ssrnai technology on our own or with a partner  we would be required to make milestone payments to isis  totaling up to million per product  as well as royalties 
also  isis initially is eligible to receive up to of any sublicense payments due to us from a third party based on our partnering of ssrnai products  which amount will decline over time as our investment in the technology and drugs increases 
in turn  we are eligible to receive up to five percent of any sublicense payments due to isis from a third party based on isis partnering of ssrnai products 
we have the unilateral right to terminate the ssrnai research program before september   in which event any licenses to ssrnai products granted by isis to us under the amended and restated isis agreement  and any obligation thereunder by us to pay milestone payments  royalties or sublicense payments to isis for such ssrnai products  would also terminate 
novartis 
beginning in september  we entered into a series of transactions with novartis which we refer to as our broad novartis alliance 
at that time  we and novartis executed a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement 
when the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement closed in october  the investor rights agreement became effective and we and novartis executed a research collaboration and license agreement 
the collaboration and license agreement had an initial term of three years  with an option for two additional one year extensions at the election of novartis 
in july  novartis elected to further extend the term for the fifth and final planned year  through october under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  we and novartis work together on a defined number of selected targets  as defined in the collaboration and license agreement  to discover and develop therapeutics based on rnai 
in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an upfront payment of million to us in october  partly to reimburse prior 
table of contents costs incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
the collaboration and license agreement also includes terms under which novartis has been providing us with research funding and development milestone payments  and may provide us in the future with sales milestone payments as well as royalties on annual net sales of products resulting from the collaboration  if any 
the amount of research funding provided by novartis under the collaboration and license agreement during the research term is dependent upon the number of active programs on which we are collaborating with them at any given time and the number of our employees that are working on those programs  in respect of which novartis reimburses us at an agreed upon rate 
under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  novartis has the right to select up to exclusive targets to include in the collaboration  which number may be increased to under certain circumstances and upon additional payments 
for rnai therapeutic products developed under the agreement  if any  we would be entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of certain specified development and annual net sales events  up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic product 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from novartis 
the collaboration and license agreement also provides novartis with a non exclusive option to integrate into its operations our intellectual property relating to rnai technology  excluding any technology related to delivery of nucleic acid based molecules 
novartis may exercise this integration option at any point during the research term  which term is currently expected to expire in the fourth quarter of in connection with the exercise of the integration option  novartis would be required to make additional payments to us totaling million  payable in full at the time of exercise  which payments would include an option exercise fee  a milestone based on the overall success of the collaboration and pre paid milestones and royalties that could become due as a result of future development of products using our technology 
this amount would be offset by any license fees due to our licensors in accordance with the applicable license agreements with those parties 
in addition  under this license grant  novartis may be required to make milestone and royalty payments to us in connection with the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutic products  if any 
the license grant under the integration option  if exercised by novartis  would be structured similarly to our non exclusive platform licenses with roche and takeda 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement  in october  novartis purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million  which  after such issuance  represented of our outstanding common stock as of the date of issuance 
in addition  under the investor rights agreement  we granted novartis rights to acquire additional equity securities in the event that we propose to sell or issue any equity securities  subject to specified exceptions  as described in the investor rights agreement  such that novartis would be able to maintain its then current ownership percentage in our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to terms of the investor rights agreement  in may  novartis purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share resulting in a payment to us of million 
in may  novartis purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  resulting in an aggregate payment to us of million 
this purchase allowed novartis to maintain its ownership position of of our outstanding common stock 
the exercises of this right did not result in any changes to existing rights or any additional rights to novartis 
further  during the term described in the investor rights agreement  novartis is permitted to own no more than of our outstanding shares 
at december   novartis owned of our outstanding common stock 
in addition to the broad novartis alliance  in february  we entered into the novartis flu alliance 
under the terms of the novartis flu alliance  we and novartis had joint responsibility for the development of rnai therapeutics for pandemic flu 
this program was stopped during and currently there are no specific resource commitments for this program 
biogen idec 
in september  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with biogen idec 
the collaboration is focused on the discovery and development of therapeutics based on rnai for the potential treatment of pml 
under the terms of the biogen idec agreement  we granted biogen idec an exclusive license to distribute  market and sell certain rnai therapeutics to treat pml and biogen idec has agreed to fund all related research and development activities 
we received an upfront million payment from biogen idec 
in addition  upon the successful development and utilization of a product resulting from the collaboration  if any  biogen idec would be required to pay us milestone payments  totaling million  and royalty payments on sales  if any 
due 
table of contents to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from biogen idec 
the pace and scope of future development of this program is the responsibility of biogen idec 
we expect to expend limited resources on this program in product alliances 
medtronic 
in july  we entered into an amended and restated collaboration agreement with medtronic to pursue the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders 
the amended and restated collaboration agreement supersedes the collaboration agreement entered into by the parties in february  and continues the existing collaboration between the parties focusing on the delivery of rnai therapeutics to specific areas of the brain using implantable infusion systems 
under the terms of the amended and restated collaboration agreement  we and medtronic are continuing our existing development program focused on developing a combination drug device product for the treatment of huntington s disease 
in addition  we and medtronic may jointly agree to collaborate on additional product development programs for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases  which can be addressed by the delivery of sirnas discovered and developed using our rnai therapeutics platform to the human nervous system through implantable infusion devices developed by medtronic 
we are responsible for supplying the sirna component and medtronic is responsible for supplying the device component of any product resulting from the collaboration 
with respect to the initial product development program focused on huntington s disease  each party is funding of the development efforts for the united states while medtronic is responsible for funding development efforts outside the united states 
medtronic will commercialize any resulting products and pay royalties to us based on net sales of such products  if any  which royalties in the united states are designed to approximate of the profit associated with the sale of such product and which royalties in europe are similar to more traditional pharmaceutical royalties  in that they are intended to reflect each party s contribution 
each party has the right to opt out of its obligation to fund the program under the agreement at certain stages  and the agreement provides for revised economics based on the timing of any such opt out 
other than pursuant to the initial product development program  and subject to specified exceptions  neither party may research  develop  manufacture or commercialize products that use implanted infusion devices for the direct delivery of sirnas to the human nervous system to treat huntington s disease during the term of such program 
kyowa hakko kirin 
in june  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with kyowa hakko kirin 
under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement  we granted kyowa hakko kirin an exclusive license to our intellectual property in japan and other markets in asia for the development and commercialization of an rnai therapeutic for the treatment of rsv infection 
the kyowa hakko kirin agreement covers aln rsv  as well as additional rsv specific rnai therapeutic compounds that comprise the aln rsv program 
we retain all development and commercialization rights worldwide outside of the licensed territory  subject to our agreement with cubist  described below 
under the terms of the kyowa hakko kirin agreement  in june  kyowa hakko kirin paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
in addition  kyowa hakko kirin is required to make payments to us upon achievement of specified development and sales milestones totaling up to million  and royalty payments based on annual net sales  if any  of rnai therapeutics for rsv by kyowa hakko kirin  its affiliates and sublicensees in the licensed territory 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from kyowa hakko kirin 
our collaboration with kyowa hakko kirin is governed by a joint steering committee that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
under the agreement  kyowa hakko kirin is establishing a development plan for the aln rsv program relating to the development activities to be undertaken in the licensed territory  with the initial focus on japan 
kyowa hakko kirin is responsible  at its expense  for all development activities under the development plan that are reasonably necessary for the regulatory approval and commercialization of an rnai therapeutic for the treatment of rsv in japan and the rest of the licensed 
table of contents territory 
we are responsible for supply of the product to kyowa hakko kirin under a supply agreement unless kyowa hakko kirin elects  prior to the first commercial sale of the product in the licensed territory  to manufacture the product itself or arrange for a third party to manufacture the product 
cubist 
in january  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with cubist to develop and commercialize therapeutic products based on certain of our rnai technology for the treatment of rsv 
licensed products initially included aln rsv  as well as several other second generation rnai based rsv inhibitors 
in november  we and cubist entered into an amendment to our license and collaboration agreement  which provides that we and cubist will focus our collaboration and joint development efforts on aln rsv  a second generation compound  intended for use in pediatric patients 
consistent with the original license and collaboration agreement  we and cubist each bears one half of the related development costs for aln rsv pursuant to the terms of the amendment  we are also continuing to develop aln rsv for adult transplant patients at our sole discretion and expense 
cubist has the right to resume the collaboration on aln rsv in the future  which right may be exercised for a specified period of time following the completion of our phase iib trial of aln rsv in adult lung transplant patients infected with rsv  subject to the payment by cubist of an opt in fee representing reimbursement of an agreed upon percentage of certain of our development expenses for aln rsv under the terms of the cubist agreement  we and cubist share responsibility for developing licensed products in north america and each bears one half of the related development costs  subject to the terms of the november amendment 
our collaboration with cubist for the development of licensed products in north america is governed by a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
cubist will have the sole right to commercialize licensed products in north america with costs associated with such activities and any resulting profits or losses to be split equally between us and cubist 
throughout the rest of the world  referred to as the royalty territory  excluding asia  where we have previously partnered our aln rsv program with kyowa hakko kirin  cubist has an exclusive  royalty bearing license to develop and commercialize licensed products 
in consideration for the rights granted to cubist under the agreement  in january  cubist paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
cubist also has an obligation under the agreement to pay us milestone payments  totaling up to an aggregate of million  upon the achievement of specified development and sales events in the royalty territory 
in addition  if licensed products are successfully developed  cubist will be required to pay us double digit royalties on net sales of licensed products in the royalty territory  if any  subject to offsets under certain circumstances 
upon achievement of certain development milestones  we will have the right to convert the north american co development and profit sharing arrangement into a royalty bearing license and  in addition to royalties on net sales in north america  will be entitled to receive additional milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate of million upon achievement of specified development and sales events in north america  subject to the timing of the conversion by us and the regulatory status of a licensed product at the time of conversion 
if we make the conversion to a royalty bearing license with respect to north america  then north america becomes part of the royalty territory 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from cubist 
in connection with the cubist agreement  during  we paid million of license fees to our licensors  primarily isis  in accordance with the applicable license agreements with those parties 
these fees were charged to research and development expense 
delivery initiatives we are working internally and with third party collaborators to extend our capabilities in developing technology to achieve effective and safe delivery of rnai therapeutics to a broad spectrum of organ and tissue types 
in connection with these efforts  we have entered into a number of agreements to evaluate and gain access to certain delivery technologies 
in some instances  we are also providing funding to support the advancement of these delivery technologies 
we believe that we have made considerable progress in developing our product platform 
over the past to months  we have made several of what we believe to be major advances relating to the delivery of rnai therapeutics  both internally and together with our collaborators 
the first relates to the discovery of new lnp compositions that provide dramatic improvements in the potency of gene silencing as compared to first generation 
table of contents lnps 
additionally  we believe we have discovered an important in vivo mechanism for delivery relating to the role of endogenous apolipoprotein e  or apoe  a plasma protein involved in lipoprotein metabolism  in the delivery of certain lnps into the cytoplasm of certain cells 
the latter discovery has allowed the specific targeting of lnps and allows the possibility of delivery beyond the liver 
we discuss these advances and our overall delivery efforts in more detail in the section entitled delivery initiatives found in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
in may  we entered into an agreement with the david h 
koch institute for integrative cancer research at mit  under which we are sponsoring an exclusive five year research program focused on the delivery of rnai therapeutics 
in addition  during  we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to the liposomal delivery formulation technology of tekmira for the discovery  development and commercialization of lnp formulations for the delivery of rnai therapeutics and a non exclusive worldwide license to certain liposomal delivery formulation technology of protiva biotherapeutics inc  or protiva  for the discovery  development and commercialization of certain lnp formulations for the delivery of rnai therapeutics 
in may  tekmira acquired protiva 
in connection with this acquisition  we entered into new agreements with tekmira and protiva  which provide us access to key existing and future technology and intellectual property for the systemic delivery of rnai therapeutics with liposomal delivery technologies 
under these agreements  we continue to have exclusive rights to the semple us patent no 
 and wheeler us patent nos 
 and  patents for rnai  which we believe are critical for the use of lnp delivery technology 
in july  we and tekmira agreed to jointly participate in a new research collaboration with scientists at ubc and alcana focused on the discovery of novel lipids for use in lnps for the systemic delivery of rnai therapeutics 
we are funding the collaborative research over a two year period  and the work is being conducted by our scientists together with scientists at ubc and alcana 
we will receive exclusive rights to all new inventions as well as sole rights to sublicense any resulting intellectual property to our current and future collaborators 
tekmira will receive rights to use new inventions for their own rnai therapeutic programs that are licensed under our interferx program 
we are developing aln vsp  a systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidate  for the treatment of primary and secondary liver cancer 
aln vsp contains two sirnas formulated using the first generation lnp formulation known as stable nucleic acid lipid particles  or snalp  developed in collaboration with tekmira 
we also have rights to use snalp technology in the advancement of our other systemically delivered rnai therapeutic programs  and are advancing aln ttr  for the treatment of attr  utilizing a first generation snalp formulation 
in parallel with aln ttr  we are advancing aln ttr utilizing second generation lnps 
in addition  we have published pre clinical results from development programs for other systemically delivered rnai therapeutic candidates  including aln pcs  for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  which we recently identified as our next clinical candidate 
aln pcs is being advanced using second generation lnps for systemic delivery 
in connection with tekmira s acquisition of protiva  in may we made an equity investment of million in tekmira  purchasing  shares of tekmira common stock at a price of per share  which represented a premium of per share  or an aggregate of million 
this premium was calculated on the difference between the purchase price and the closing price of tekmira s common stock on the effective date of the acquisition 
we allocated this million premium to the expansion of our access to key technology and intellectual property rights and  accordingly  recorded a charge to research and development expense during the year ended december  during  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our investment in tekmira  as the decrease in the fair value of this investment was deemed to be other than temporary 
we are pursuing additional approaches for delivery that include other lnp formulations  mimetic lipoprotein particles  or mlps  sirna conjugation strategies and ssrnai  among others 
in addition  we have other rnai therapeutic delivery collaborations and intend to continue to collaborate with government  academic and corporate third parties to evaluate and gain access to different delivery technologies 
government funding nih 
in september  the niaid  a component of nih  awarded us a contract for up to million over four years to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic for hemorrhagic fever virus  including the ebola virus 
as a result of the continued progress of this program  the niaid has appropriated the entire million over the four year term of the contract  which will be completed in september 
table of contents department of defense 
in august  dtra awarded us a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic for hemorrhagic fever virus 
the government initially committed to pay us up to million through february  which included a six month extension granted by dtra in july following a program review in early  we and dtra determined not to continue this program and accordingly  the remaining funds of up to million were not accessed 
micrornai based therapeutics regulus 
in september  we and isis established regulus  a company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of microrna based therapeutics 
regulus combines our and isis technologies  know how and intellectual property relating to microrna based therapeutics 
since micrornas are believed to regulate the expression of broad networks of genes and biological pathways  microrna based therapeutics define a new and potentially high impact strategy to target multiple points on disease pathways 
regulus  which initially was established as a limited liability company  converted to a c corporation as of january  and changed its name to regulus therapeutics inc in consideration for our and isis initial interests in regulus  we and isis each granted regulus exclusive licenses to our intellectual property for certain microrna based therapeutics as well as certain patents in the microrna field 
in addition  we made an initial cash contribution to regulus of million  resulting in us and isis making initial capital contributions to regulus of approximately equal aggregate value 
in addition  in march  we and isis each purchased million of series a preferred stock of regulus 
we and isis currently own approximately and  respectively  of regulus and there are currently no other third party investors in regulus 
regulus continues to operate as an independent company with a separate board of directors  scientific advisory board and management team  some of whom have options to purchase common stock of regulus 
members of the board of directors of regulus who are our employees or isis employees are not eligible to receive options to purchase regulus common stock 
regulus most advanced program  which is in pre clinical research  is a microrna based therapeutic candidate that targets mir mir is a liver expressed microrna that has been shown to be a critical endogenous host factor for the replication of hcv  and anti mirs targeting mir have been shown to block hcv infection 
hcv infection is a significant disease worldwide  for which emerging therapies target viral genes and  therefore  are prone to viral resistance 
regulus is also pursuing a program that targets mir pre clinical studies by regulus and collaborators have shown that mir is implicated in several therapeutic areas  including heart failure and fibrosis 
in addition to these programs  regulus is also actively exploring additional areas for development of microrna based therapeutics  including cancer  other viral diseases  metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases 
in april  regulus entered into a worldwide strategic alliance with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  to discover  develop and market novel microrna targeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease 
in connection with this alliance  regulus received million in upfront payments from gsk  including a million option fee and a loan of million evidenced by a promissory note guaranteed by us and isis that will convert into regulus common stock under certain specified circumstances 
regulus could be eligible to receive development  regulatory and sales milestone payments for each of the four microrna targeted therapeutics discovered and developed as part of the alliance  and would also receive royalty payments on worldwide sales of products resulting from the alliance  if any 
in may  regulus achieved the first demonstration of a pharmacological effect in immune cells by specific microrna inhibition  the initial discovery milestone under the gsk alliance  which triggered a payment under the agreement 
in february  regulus and gsk established a new collaboration to develop and commercialize microrna based therapeutics targeting mir in all fields  with hcv infection as the lead indication 
this new collaboration includes the potential for regulus to earn more than million in upfront and milestone payments  in addition to royalties  on worldwide sales of products  if any  as regulus and gsk advance microrna based therapeutics targeting mir 
table of contents alnylam biotherapeutics during  we presented new data regarding the application of rnai technology to improve the manufacturing processes for biologics  which is comprised of recombinant proteins  monoclonal antibodies  and vaccines 
this initiative  which we are advancing in an internal effort referred to as alnylam biotherapeutics  has the potential to create new business opportunities 
in particular  we are advancing rnai technologies to improve the quantity and quality of biologics manufacturing processes using mammalian cell culture  such as chinese hamster ovary cells  or cho cells 
this rnai technology potentially could be applied to the improvement of manufacturing processes for existing marketed drugs  new drugs in development and for the emerging biosimilars market 
we have developed proprietary delivery lipids that enable the efficient transfection of sirnas into cho cells when grown in suspension culture 
as alnylam biotherapeutics advances the technology  it plans to seek partnerships with established biologic manufacturers  selling licenses  products and services 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical and pre clinical development milestones  manufacturing services and royalties on product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the license only if we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either not have stand alone value or have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 

table of contents revenue recognized under the proportional performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the proportional performance method  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  then revenue under the arrangement will be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line method  as of the period ending date 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
many of our collaboration agreements entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of performance based milestones 
if the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration  the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration  such as upfront fees and research funding  in our revenue model 
milestones that involve substantial effort on our part and the achievement of which are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration are considered substantive milestones 
substantive milestones are included in our revenue model when achievement of the milestone is considered probable 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period using the proportional performance or straight line method 
milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable of being achieved until such approval is received 
milestones tied to counter party performance are not included in our revenue model until the performance conditions are met 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the accounting standard that governs such transactions 
this standard addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to date and probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer  and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price would be recorded as an expense 
we evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper classification in our consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the underlying activity 
transactions between collaborators recorded in our consolidated statements of operations are recorded on either a gross or net basis  depending on the characteristics of the collaborative relationship 
we generally reflect amounts due under our collaborative agreements related to cost sharing of development activities as a reduction of research and development expense 

table of contents amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within the next months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next months 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to the next months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan and  if our operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next month period 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
as of december   we had short term and long term deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our collaborations 
novartis 
in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an upfront payment of million to us in october to partly reimburse costs previously incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
the collaboration and license agreement includes terms under which novartis is providing us with research funding 
in addition  for rnai therapeutic products developed under the agreement  if any  we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of certain specified development and annual net sales events  up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic product 
we initially recorded as deferred revenue the non refundable million upfront payment and the million premium that represented the difference between the purchase price and the closing price of our common stock on the date of the stock purchase from novartis 
in addition to these payments  research funding and certain milestone payments  the receipt of which is considered probable  are being amortized into revenue using the proportional performance method over the estimated duration of the collaboration and license agreement  or ten years 
under this method  we estimate the level of effort to be expended over the term of the agreement and recognize revenue based on the lesser of the amount calculated based on the proportional performance of total expected revenue or the amount of non refundable payments earned 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  and to the extent they are within the period of performance  milestone payments will be recognized as revenue on a proportional performance basis over the contract s entire performance period  starting with the contract s commencement 
a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of total performance completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period under the proportional performance method 
we believe our estimated period of performance under the novartis collaboration and license agreement is ten years  which includes the three year initial term of the agreement  the two one year extensions elected by novartis and limited support as part of a technology transfer until  the fifth anniversary of the termination of the collaboration and license agreement 
we continue to use an expected term of ten years in our proportional performance model 
we reevaluate the expected term when new information is known that could affect our estimate 
in the event our period of performance is different than we estimated  revenue recognition will be adjusted on a prospective basis 
roche 
we received aggregate proceeds from roche of million in august we initially recorded million of these proceeds as deferred revenue in connection with this alliance 
we allocated million 
table of contents and million for financial statement purposes related to the common stock issuance and the net book value of alnylam europe  respectively 
in exchange for our contributions under the collaboration agreement  for each rnai therapeutic product developed by roche  its affiliates or sublicensees under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of specified development and sales events  totaling up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic target  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
in addition  we agreed with roche to collaborate on the discovery of rnai therapeutic products directed to one or more disease targets  subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
in october  we and roche advanced our alliance to initiate this therapeutic collaboration stage 
under this discovery collaboration  we and roche are collaborating on the discovery and development of specific rnai therapeutic products and each party contributes key delivery technologies in the effort  which is focused on specific disease targets 
the discovery collaboration is governed by the joint steering committee that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
we have determined that the deliverables under the roche alliance include the license  the alnylam europe assets and employees  the steering committees joint steering committee and future technology committee and the services that we are performing under the discovery collaboration 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the license and assets of alnylam europe are not separable from the undelivered services ie  the steering committees and discovery collaboration and  accordingly  the license and the services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
when multiple deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we base our revenue recognition pattern on the final deliverable 
under the roche alliance  the steering committee services and the discovery collaboration services are the final deliverables and all such services will end  contractually  five years from the effective date of the license and collaboration agreement 
we are recognizing the roche related revenue on a straight line basis over five years because we cannot reasonably estimate the total level of effort required to complete our service obligations under the license and collaboration agreement in order to utilize a proportional performance model 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period on a straight line basis 
takeda 
in consideration for the rights granted to takeda under the takeda agreement  takeda agreed to pay us million in upfront and near term technology transfer payments 
in june  takeda paid us an upfront payment of million 
takeda is also required to make an additional million in payments to us upon achievement of specified technology transfer milestones  million of which was paid in october  million of which is due upon achievement of specified technology transfer activities  but no later than may  and million of which is due upon achievement of specified technology transfer activities within to months after execution of the agreement 
if takeda elects to expand its license to additional therapeutic areas  takeda will be required to pay us million for each of up to approximately total additional fields selected  if any  comprising substantially all other fields of human disease  as identified and agreed upon by the parties 
in addition  for each rnai therapeutic product developed by takeda  its affiliates and sublicensees  we are entitled to receive specified development and commercialization milestones  totaling up to million per product  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
pursuant to the takeda agreement  we and takeda have also agreed to collaborate on the research of rnai therapeutics directed to one or two disease targets agreed to by the parties  subject to our existing contractual obligations with third parties 
takeda also has the option  subject to certain conditions  to collaborate with us on the research and development of rnai drug delivery technology for targets agreed to by the parties 
in addition  takeda has a right of first negotiation for the development and commercialization of our rnai therapeutic products in the asian territory  excluding our aln rsv program 
in addition to our profit sharing option  we have a similar right of first negotiation to participate with takeda in the development and commercialization in the united states of licensed products 
the collaboration is governed by a jttc  a jrcc and a jdcc  each of which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
we have determined that the deliverables under the takeda agreement include the license  the joint committees the jttc  jrcc and jdcc  the technology transfer activities and the services that we will be obligated to perform 
table of contents under the research collaboration with takeda 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the license and undelivered services ie  the joint committees and the research collaboration are not separable and  accordingly  the license and services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
under the takeda agreement  the last elements to be delivered are the jdcc and jttc services  each of which has a life of no more than seven years 
we are recognizing the upfront payment of million  the first technology transfer milestone of million and the million of remaining technology transfer milestones  the receipt of which we believe is probable  on a straight line basis over seven years because we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill these obligations  primarily because the effort required under the research collaboration is largely unknown  in order to utilize a proportional performance model 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period on a straight line basis 
kyowa hakko kirin 
under the terms of the kyowa hakko kirin agreement  in june  kyowa hakko kirin paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
in addition  kyowa hakko kirin is required to make payments to us upon achievement of specified development and sales milestones totaling up to million  and royalty payments based on annual net sales  if any  of rnai therapeutics for rsv by kyowa hakko kirin  its affiliates and sublicenses in the licensed territory 
our collaboration with kyowa hakko kirin is governed by a joint steering committee that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
kyowa hakko kirin is responsible  at its expense  for all development activities under the development plan that are reasonably necessary for the regulatory approval and commercialization of an rnai therapeutic for the treatment of rsv in japan and the rest of the licensed territory 
we are responsible for supply of the product to kyowa hakko kirin under a supply agreement unless kyowa hakko kirin elects  prior to the first commercial sale of the product in the licensed territory  to manufacture the product itself or arrange for a third party to manufacture the product 
we have determined that the deliverables under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement include the license  the joint steering committee  the manufacturing services and any additional rsv specific rnai therapeutic compounds that comprise the aln rsv program 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the individual deliverables are not separable and  accordingly  must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we are currently unable to reasonably estimate our period of performance under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement  as we are unable to estimate the timeline of our deliverables related to the fixed price option granted to kyowa hakko kirin for any additional compounds 
we are deferring all revenue under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement until we are able to reasonably estimate our period of performance 
we will continue to reassess whether we can reasonably estimate the period of performance to fulfill our obligations under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement 
cubist 
under the terms of the cubist agreement  we and cubist share responsibility for developing licensed products in north america and each bears one half of the related development costs  subject to the terms of the november amendment 
our collaboration with cubist for the development of licensed products in north america is governed by a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
cubist will have the sole right to commercialize licensed products in north america with costs associated with such activities and any resulting profits or losses to be split equally between us and cubist 
throughout the rest of the world  referred to as the royalty territory  excluding asia  where we have previously partnered our aln rsv program with kyowa hakko kirin  cubist has an exclusive  royalty bearing license to develop and commercialize licensed products 
in consideration for the rights granted to cubist under the agreement  in january  cubist paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
cubist also has an obligation under the agreement to pay us milestone payments  totaling up to an aggregate of million  upon the achievement of specified development and sales events in the royalty territory 
in addition  if licensed products are successfully developed  cubist will be required to pay us double digit royalties on net sales of licensed products in the royalty territory  if any  subject to offsets under certain circumstances 
upon achievement of certain development milestones  we will have the right to 
table of contents convert the north american co development and profit sharing arrangement into a royalty bearing license and  in addition to royalties on net sales in north america  will be entitled to receive additional milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate of million upon achievement of specified development and sales events in north america  subject to the timing of the conversion by us and the regulatory status of a licensed product at the time of conversion 
if we make the conversion to a royalty bearing license with respect to north america  then north america becomes part of the royalty territory 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from cubist 
we have determined that the deliverables under the cubist agreement include the licenses  technology transfer related to the aln rsv program  the joint steering committee and the development and manufacturing services that we are obligated to perform during the development period 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the licenses and undelivered services are not separable and  accordingly  the licenses and services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
under the cubist agreement  the last element to be delivered is the development and manufacturing services  which have an expected life of approximately eight years 
we are recognizing the upfront payment of million on a straight line basis over approximately eight years because we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill our performance obligations in order to utilize a proportional performance model 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period on a straight line basis 
under the terms of the cubist agreement  we and cubist share responsibility for developing licensed products in north america and each bears one half of the related development costs  provided that under the terms of the november amendment  we are funding the advancement of aln rsv for adult lung transplant patients and cubist retains an opt in right 
for revenue generating arrangements that involve cost sharing between both parties  we present the results of activities for which we act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap  or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational and consistently applied accounting policy election 
as we are not considered the principal under the cubist agreement  we record any amounts due from cubist as a reduction of research and development expense 
government contracts 
revenue under government cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as we perform the underlying research and development activities 
accounting for income taxes in january  we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional accounting and disclosure about uncertain tax positions 
this standard clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on the derecognition of previously recognized deferred tax items  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under this standard  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we operate in the united states and germany where our income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
we develop our cumulative probability assessment of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal experience  judgment and assistance from professional advisors 
estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from our current estimate may result in additional tax expense in future periods 

table of contents we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
we provide income tax expense for federal alternative minimum tax  state and foreign taxes 
we generated us taxable income during and due to the recognition of certain proceeds received from the roche and takeda alliances 
our and us taxable income will be offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes 
however  we were subject to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in and at december   we had a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
at december   we had utilized all federal and massachusetts state net operating loss carryforwards and all foreign tax credits 
at december   we had million of state research and development tax credit carryforwards derived from stock option exercises that are available to reduce future massachusetts tax liabilities 
at december   the california state net operating loss carryforward was million related to regulus  located in california 
we have placed a valuation allowance against the state net operating loss and state credit deferred tax assets as it is unlikely that we will realize these assets 
ownership changes  as defined in the internal revenue code  including those resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with our public offerings  may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income or tax liability 
the amount of the limitation is determined in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
we have determined that there is no limitation on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in accordance with section of the internal revenue code in accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted a newly issued accounting standard addressing recognition and disclosure of stock compensation 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of this standard  using the modified prospective transition method 
all stock based awards granted to non employees are accounted for at their fair value and compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of our publicly traded stock 
for stock option grants issued during the year ended december   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility assumption of 
our expected life assumption is based on the equal weighting of our historical data and the historical data of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology peers 
our weighted average expected term was years for the year ended december  we utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
as of december   the estimated fair value of unvested employee awards was million  net of estimated forfeitures 
this amount will be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately years for these awards 
stock based employee compensation expense was million for the year ended december  however  the total amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in any future period cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of stock based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest 
the stock compensation accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will actually vest  and therefore have applied an annual 
table of contents forfeiture rate of to all unvested options as of december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
accounting for joint venture we account for our interest in regulus using the equity method of accounting 
we reviewed the consolidation guidance that defines a variable interest entity  or vie  and concluded that regulus currently qualifies as a vie 
the founding investor rights agreement contains transfer restrictions on each of isis and our interests and  as a result  we and isis are considered related parties 
because we and isis are related parties and collectively own of regulus  the determination of which entity would be considered the primary beneficiary is based on which entity is most closely associated with regulus 
following consolidation guidance  we have concluded that isis is the primary beneficiary and  accordingly  we have not consolidated regulus and account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 
under new consolidation guidance effective january   we do not expect isis to continue to consolidate regulus 
estimated liability for development costs we record accrued liabilities related to expenses for which service providers have not yet billed us with respect to products or services that we have received  specifically related to ongoing pre clinical studies and clinical trials 
these costs primarily relate to third party clinical management costs  laboratory and analysis costs  toxicology studies and investigator fees 
we have multiple product candidates in concurrent pre clinical studies and clinical trials at multiple clinical sites throughout the world 
in order to ensure that we have adequately provided for ongoing pre clinical and clinical development costs during the period in which we incur such costs  we maintain an accrual to cover these expenses 
we update our estimate for this accrual on at least a quarterly basis 
the assessment of these costs is a subjective process that requires judgment 
upon settlement  these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual amounts 
results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  net revenues from research collaborators operating expenses loss from operations net loss discussion of results of operations for and the following table summarizes our total consolidated net revenues from research collaborators  for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  roche takeda novartis government contract other research collaborator interferx program  research reagent license and other total net revenues from research collaborators 
table of contents revenues increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of a full year of revenues from our may alliance with takeda 
we are recognizing as revenue the million in upfront and technology transfer milestone payments made or due to us under the takeda alliance on a straight line basis over seven years  which equates to approximately million per quarter 
also contributing to the increase in were higher revenues under the roche alliance related primarily to a development milestone achieved in under the roche alliance  we are recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over five years  which equates to approximately million per quarter 
the decrease in novartis revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due in part to a reduction in the number of resources allocated to the broad novartis alliance 
the novartis collaboration and related portion of novartis revenues are currently expected to end in the fourth quarter of the novartis collaboration and license agreement provides novartis with a non exclusive option to integrate into its operations our intellectual property relating to rnai technology  excluding any technology related to delivery of nucleic acid based molecules 
novartis may exercise this integration option at any point during the research term 
in connection with the exercise of the integration option  novartis would be required to make additional payments to us totaling million  payable in full at the time of exercise  which payments would include an option exercise fee  a milestone based on the overall success of the collaboration  and pre paid milestones and royalties that could become due as a result of future development of products using our technology 
novartis exercise of this integration option would increase revenues substantially 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   government contract revenues decreased primarily as a result of the wind down of our collaboration with dtra 
following a program review  in february  we and dtra determined not to continue this program and accordingly  the remaining funds were not accessed 
other research collaborator revenues increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to our alliance with cubist 
in consideration for the rights granted to cubist under the agreement  in january  cubist paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
we are recognizing this million payment as revenue on a straight line basis over approximately eight years 
the decrease in interferx program  research reagent license and other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was due to milestone payments from certain interferx licensees received in total deferred revenue of million at december  consists of payments received from collaborators  primarily roche  takeda  kyowa hakko kirin and cubist  that we have yet to recognize pursuant to our revenue recognition policies 
for the foreseeable future  we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from our alliances with roche  takeda  novartis and cubist  as well as other strategic alliances  collaborations  government and foundation funding  and licensing activities

also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was an increase in compensation and related  non cash stock based compensation and facilities related expenses due primarily to additional research and development headcount to support our alliances and expanding product pipeline 
partially offsetting these increases  external services expenses decreased during the year ended december  as a result of lower pre clinical activities due primarily to the wind down of our collaboration with dtra 
in addition  under the terms of our january agreement with cubist  we and cubist each were responsible for one half of the development costs for our aln rsv program through november in november  we and cubist agreed to focus our collaboration and joint development efforts on aln rsv for use in pediatric patients 
in turn  alnylam is funding the advancement of aln rsv for adult lung transplant patients and cubist retains an opt in right 
for the year ended december   we recorded amounts due from cubist of million as a reduction to research and development expenses 
we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development expenses and we expect that research and development expenses will remain consistent or increase slightly in as we continue development of our and our collaborators product candidates and focus on continuing to develop drug delivery related technologies 
we do not track actual costs for most of our research and development programs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a project by project basis because our most advanced programs are in the early stages of clinical development 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development costs are not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our technology platform 
however  our collaboration agreements contain cost sharing arrangements whereby certain costs incurred under the project are reimbursed 
costs reimbursed under the agreements typically include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full time equivalent labor rate for the actual time worked on the project 
in addition  we are reimbursed under our government contracts for certain allowable costs including direct internal and external costs 
as a result  although a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project by project basis  we do track direct external costs attributable to  and the actual time our employees worked on  our collaborations and government contracts

also contributing to the increase were higher non cash stock based compensation and compensation and related expenses due to a modest increase in general and administrative headcount over the past year to support our growth 
we expect that general and administrative expenses  excluding expenses associated with legal activities  will remain consistent or increase slightly in other income expense we incurred million equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  related to our share of the net losses incurred by regulus 
through december   we were recognizing the first million of losses of regulus as equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc in our consolidated statements of operations because we were responsible for funding those losses through our initial million cash contribution 
beginning in january  in connection with the conversion of regulus to a c corporation  we are recognizing approximately of the income and losses of regulus 
the carrying value of our investment in joint venture regulus therapeutics inc immediately prior to the conversion to a c corporation exceeded of the net assets of regulus by approximately million 
upon conversion  this amount was allocated to the intellectual property of regulus and  because the intellectual property was determined to be in process research and development  the million was recorded as a charge to expense 
this charge is included in equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  separate financial information for regulus is included in exhibit to this annual report on form k

during the current downturn in global financial markets  some companies have experienced difficulties accessing their cash equivalents  investment securities and raising capital generally  which have had a material adverse impact on their liquidity 
in addition  the current economic downturn has severely diminished the availability of capital and may limit our ability to access these markets to obtain financing in the future 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities  for which we have not recognized any impairment charges  together with the cash we expect to generate under our current alliances  including our novartis  roche  takeda and cubist alliances  will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next several years  during which time we expect to further the development of our product candidates  conduct clinical trials  extend the capabilities of our technology platform and continue to prosecute patent applications and otherwise build and maintain our patent portfolio 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to develop  conduct clinical trials for and commercialize any product candidates 
in the longer term  we may seek additional funding through additional collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue 
even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors  including our progress in demonstrating that sirnas can be active as drugs  our ability to develop relatively standard procedures for selecting and modifying sirna product candidates  progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from present and future collaborators  if any  the timing  receipt and amount of funding under current and future government contracts  if any

these amounts are charged to general and administrative expense 
in addition  we are a party to a number of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business  which contain typical provisions that obligate us to indemnify the other parties to such agreements upon the occurrence of certain events

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued the fasb accounting standards codification  or asc 
effective in the third quarter of  the asc became the single source for all authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb  and is required to be applied to financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the asc does not change gaap and did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 
this standard eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previously  accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  which has not yet been integrated into the asc 
accordingly  it will remain authoritative until integrated 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  or sfas  amends previously issued accounting guidance for the consolidation of a vie to require an enterprise to determine whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this amended consolidation guidance for vies also replaces the existing quantitative approach for identifying which enterprise should consolidate a vie  which was based on which enterprise was exposed to a majority of the risks and rewards  with a qualitative approach  based on which enterprise has both the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this new accounting standard has broad implications and may affect how we account for the consolidation of common structures  such as joint ventures  equity method investments  collaboration and other agreements  and purchase arrangements 
under this revised consolidation guidance  more entities may meet the definition of a vie  and the determination about who should consolidate a vie is required to be evaluated continuously 
we have completed our evaluation of the impact of adopting this standard and determined that the adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our marketable securities consist of us government and municipal obligations  high grade corporate notes and commercial paper 
all of our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale investments in debt securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in the credit ratings of the issuers 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points  or one half of a percentage point  from levels at december   the net fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments would have resulted in a hypothetical decline of million 
a downgrade in the credit rating of an issuer of a debt security or further deterioration of the credit markets could result in a decline in the fair value of the debt instruments 
our investment guidelines prohibit investment in auction rate securities and we do not believe we have any direct exposure to losses relating from mortgage based securities or derivatives related thereto such as credit default swaps 
we have not recorded any impairment charges to our fixed income marketable securities as of december
