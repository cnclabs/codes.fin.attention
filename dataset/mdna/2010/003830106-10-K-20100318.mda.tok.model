item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements in item general we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the development and production of oil and gas 
historically  we have grown through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploitation of producing properties  principally through the redevelopment of old fields utilizing new technologies such as modern log analysis and reservoir modeling techniques as well as d seismic surveys and horizontal drilling 
as a result of these activities  we believe that we have a number of development opportunities on our properties 
in addition  we intend to expand upon our development activities with complementary exploration projects in our core areas of operation 
success in our development and exploration activities is critical in the maintenance and growth of our current production levels and associated reserves 
while we have attained positive net income from continuing operations in three of the last five years  there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors which significantly affect our results of operations including the following commodity prices and the effectiveness of our hedging arrangements  the level of total sales volumes of oil and gas  the availability of  and our ability to raise additional capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and the level and success of exploration and development activity 
commodity prices and hedging arrangements 
the results of our operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for our oil and gas production 
the prices we receive for our production are dependent upon spot market prices  price differentials and the effectiveness of our derivative contracts  which we sometimes refer to as hedging arrangements 
substantially all of our sales of oil and gas are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received for our oil and gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control 
significant declines in prices for oil and gas could ha ve a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
recently  the prices of oil and gas have been volatile 
during  oil prices remained strong while gas prices began strong but weakened during the course of the year 
during the first half of  prices for oil and gas were sustained at record or near record levels  however  during the second half of  and the first half of there was a significant drop in prices 
prices began to improve during the second half of new york mercantile exchange nymex futures price for west texas intermediate wti oil averaged per barrel for wti oil ended at per barrel 
nymex henry hub futures price for gas averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu during and ended the year at 
for  nymex futures price for wti oil averaged and ended at per barr el 
nymex henry hub futures price for gas averaged per mmbtu during and ended the year at 
if commodity prices decline  our revenue and cash flow from operations could also decline 
in addition  lower commodity prices could also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
the current global recession has had a significant impact on commodity prices and our operations 
if gas prices remain depressed or oil prices decline significantly  our revenues  profitability and cash flow from operations may decrease which could cause us to alter our business plans  including reducing our drilling activities 
the decline in commodity prices during resulted in downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves at december  for we incurred a ceiling limitation write down under applicable accounting rules 
under these rules  if the net capitalized cost of our oil and gas properties exceeds the pv of our reserves  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
as of december   the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million 
these amounts were calculated considering year end prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of our oil and gas reserves compared to the full cost pool 
this charge did not impact cash flow from operating activities  but did reduce our stockholder s equity and earnings 
as of december   the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties did not exceed the present value of our estimated proved reserves 
these amounts were calculated considering first day of the month average prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of our oil and gas reserves compared to the full cost pool 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
the realized prices that we receive for our production differ from nymex futures and spot market prices  principally due to basis differentials which are dependent on actual delivery location  adjustments for btu content  and gathering  processing and transportation costs 
during  differentials averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas compared to per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas in and per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas in we experienced greater oil differentials during compared to prior years because of the increased percentage of our production from the rocky mountain and mid continent regions which experience higher differentials than our permian basin and gulf coast properties 
approximately of our production during was from our rocky mountain and mid continent properties 
as the percentage of our production from the rocky mountain and mid continent regions increases  we expect that our price differentials will also increase 
increases in the differential between the ben chmark prices for oil and gas and the wellhead price we receive could significantly reduce our revenues and our cash flow from operations 
our credit facility also required us to enter into hedging arrangements for specified volumes  which equate to approximately of the estimated oil and gas production from our net proved developed producing reserves through december  and for by removing a significant portion of price volatility on our future oil and gas production  we believe we will mitigate  but not eliminate  the potential effects of changing commodity prices on our cash flow from operations for those periods 
however  when prevailing market prices are higher than our contract prices  we will not realize increased cash flow on the portion of the production that has been hedged 
we have sustained and in the future will sustain realized and unrealized losses on our derivative contracts if market prices are higher than our contract prices 
conversely  when prevailing market prices are lower than our contract prices  we will sustain realized and unrealized gains on our commodity derivative contracts 
for example  in  we sustained an unrealized loss of millio n and a realized gain of million 
in  we incurred a realized loss of million and an unrealized gain of million 
in we incurred a realized gain of million and an unrealized loss of million 
we have not designated any of these derivative contracts as a hedge as prescribed by applicable accounting rules 
the following table sets forth our derivative position at december  fixed price swap oil gas contract periods daily volume bbl swap price daily volume mmbtu swap price at december   the aggregate fair market value of our oil and gas derivative contracts was a liability of approximately million 
production volumes 
because our proved reserves will decline as oil and gas are produced  unless we find  acquire or develop additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
approximately of the estimated ultimate recovery of our proved developed producing reserves as of december  had been produced 
based on the reserve information set forth in our reserve estimates as of december   our average annual estimated decline rate for net proved developed producing reserves is during the first five years  in the next five years  and approximately thereafter 
these rates of decline are estimates an d actual production declines could be materially higher 
while we have had some success in finding  acquiring and developing additional reserves  we have not always been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and prior property sales 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploration and development projects 
we had capital expenditures during of million 
we have a capital budget for of approximately million 
the final amount of our capital expenditures for will depend on our success rate  production levels  the availability of capital and commodity prices 
the following table presents historical net production volumes for the years ended december   and year ended december  total production mboe average daily production boepd availability of capital 
as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  our sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash flow from operating activities  funding under our credit facility  cash on hand and proceeds from the sale of properties and is an appropriate opportunity presents itself  sales of debt or equity securities  although we may not be able to complete any financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
as of december   we had million of availability under our credit facility 
exploration and development activity 
we believe that our high quality asset base  high degree of operational control and inventory of drilling projects position us for future growth 
at december   we operated properties accounting for approximately of our pv  giving us substantial control over the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures 
we have identified numerous additional drilling locations of which were classified as proved undeveloped at december  on our existing leaseholds the successful development of which we believe could significantly increase our production and proved reserves 
over the five years ended december   we drilled or participated in gross net wells of which resulte d in commercially productive wells 
our future oil and gas production  and therefore our success  is highly dependent upon our ability to find  acquire and develop additional reserves that are profitable to produce 
the rate of production from our oil and gas properties and our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful development and exploration activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we cannot assure you that our exploration and development activities will result in increases in our proved reserves 
if our proved reserves decline in the future  our production may also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations and the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facility wil l also decline 
in addition  approximately of our estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
we may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves  in which case our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
borrowings and interest 
at december   we had a total of million outstanding under our credit facility and availability of million 
if interest expense increases as a result of higher interest rates or increased borrowings  more cash flow from operations would be used to meet debt service requirements 
as a result  we would need to increase our cash flow from operations in order to fund the development of our numerous drilling opportunities which  in turn  will be dependent upon the level of our production volumes and commodity prices 
in order to mitigate our interest rate exposure  we entered into an interest rate swap  effective august   to f ix our floating libor based debt 
the two year interest rate swap arrangement for million at a fixed rate of expires on august  this interest rate swap was amended in february lowering our fixed rate to 
the interest rate swap was further amended in november  lowering our fixed rate to on the swap  and extending the term through august  results of operations selected operating data 
the following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the periods presented 
average prices reflect realized prices excluding the impact of hedging activities 
years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per unit data 
operating revenue oil sales gas sales rig and other total operating revenues operating income loss oil production mbbls gas production mmcf average oil sales price per bbl average gas sales price per mcf revenue is before the impact of hedging activities 
operating loss in includes a million proved property impairment 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from oil and gas sales decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in revenue was due to lower oil and gas prices in as compared to which were partially offset by increased production volumes in as compared to the decrease in commodity prices had negative impact of million while increased production volumes contributed million to revenue 
oil production volumes increased from mbbls for the year ended december  to mbbls for the same period of  primarily due to production from new wells placed on production during gas production volumes decreased from  mmcf for the year ended december  to  mmcf for the same period of  primarily due to natural field declines 
average sales prices in  before realized gain loss on derivative contracts were per bbl of oil  and per mcf of gas 
average sales prices in  before realized gain loss on derivative contracts were per bbl of oil  and per mcf of gas 
lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense loe  decreased from million in to million in as a result of lower operating costs 
loe per boe for the year ended december  was per boe compared to for the same period of the decrease in per boe was attributable to lower lease operating expenses 
g a expense 
general and administrative expense  or g a  excluding stock based compensation increased from million in to million in the increase in g a expenses in as compared to was primarily due to higher professional and consulting fees  as well as increased cost for director fees related to the merger 
g a expense per boe was for compared to for the same period of the increase per boe cost was attributable to the higher g a during as compared to stock based compensation 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
in addition to options  restricted shares of common stock have been granted 
for the years ended december  and  stock based compensation was approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was due to expenses related to higher valued options granted in prior years that have been fully amortized 
dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  dd a expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease in dd a was primarily the result of the producing property impairment in which reduced our full cost pool 
our dd a per boe for was per boe as compared to per boe in the decrease on a per boe basis in was primarily the result of the book value of our full cost pool being reduced  due the impairment incurred in interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million for the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates 
income taxes 
for the year ended december  we incurred million in federal and state income taxes 
the taxes were the result of a tax basis gain on the merger of abraxas energy partners into abraxas petroleum 
no income tax expense or benefit has been recognized due to losses or loss carryforwards and valuation allowance  which has been recorded against such benefits 
income loss from derivative contracts 
we account for derivative contract gains and losses based on realized and unrealized amounts 
the realized derivative gains or losses are determined by actual derivative settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of derivative contracts in place 
our derivative contract transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting as prescribed by asc  therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contracts are recognized in earnings during the current period 
our derivative contracts consist of commodity swaps and interest rate swaps 
the estimated value of our derivative contracts was a liability of approximately million as of december  when our der ivative contract prices are higher than prevailing market prices  we incur realized and unrealized gains and conversely  when our derivative contract prices are lower than prevailing market prices  we incur realized and unrealized losses 
for the year ended december   we realized a gain on our derivative contracts of million  which included a realized gain of million on our commodity swaps and a realized loss of million on our interest rate swap 
for the year ended december   we incurred an unrealized loss of million  which included an unrealized loss of million on our commodity swaps and an unrealized gain of million on our interest rate swap 
for the year ended december   we realized a loss on our derivative contracts of million and we incurred an unrealized gain of million 
other expense 
for the year ended december   as the result of the exchange and registration rights agreement whereby partnership unitholders  under certain circumstances could convert their partnership units into abraxas common stock  we recognized an expense of million  including approximately  relating to shares converted during the fourth quarter of and million representing the fair value of potential conversions 
during  other expense consisted primarily of costs related to the planned initial public offering of the partnership  which had previously been capitalized 
ceiling limitation write down 
we record the carrying value of our oil and gas properties using the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under the full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less related deferred taxes  are limited by country  to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost ceiling  defined as the sum of the present value of estimated unescalated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less related i ncome taxes 
if the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties exceeds the ceiling limit  we are subject to a ceiling limitation write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation write down is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such write downs do impact the amount of our stockholders equity 
in accordance with new sec requirements  the cost ceiling represents the present value discounted at of net cash flows from sales of future production using average price over the prior month period 
as of december   our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million 
these amounts were calculated in accordance with previous sec rules considering year end prices of per bbl for oil and per mcf for gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for our oil and gas reserves as compared to the full cost pool 
as of december   our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties did not exceed the present value of our estimated proved reserves 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas assets increases when oil and gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our gas 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved reserves are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may be required 
based on managements review of average first day of the month prices for the twelve months april through march  we do not anticipate a write down at the end of the firs t quarter of non controlling interest 
non controlling interest represents the share of the net income loss of the partnership for the period owned by the partners other than abraxas 
additionally  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect at the time  when cumulative losses applicable to the non controlling interest exceed the non controlling interest equity capital in the entity  such excess and any further losses applicable to the non controlling interest are charged to the earnings of the controlling interest 
if future earnings are recognized by the non controlling interest  such earnings will then be credited to the controlling interest abraxas to the exte nt of such losses previously absorbed and any excess earnings will increase the recorded value 
for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the ceiling test impairment  losses applicable to the non controlling interest exceeded the controlling interest equity capital by million 
as a result  million of the non controlling interest loss in excess of equity was charged to earnings attributable to abraxas and was reflected as a reduction of the loss applicable to the non controlling interest 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from oil and gas sales increased by million from million in to million in the increase in revenue was due to increased production volumes in as compared to as well as higher oil and gas prices realized in as compared to the increase in production volumes contributed million to revenue while increased commodity prices contributed million to oil and gas revenue 
oil production volumes increased from mbbls for the year ended december  to mbbls for the same period of the increase in oil volumes was primarily due to production from properties acquired in the st 
mary acquisition that closed on january  production for the year ended december  from these properties added mbbls of oil 
gas production volumes increased from  mmcf for the year ended december  to  mmcf for the same period of the properties acquired in the st 
mary acquisition contributed  mmcf of gas production during the year  which was partially offset by natural field declines 
average sales prices in  before realized gain loss on derivative contracts were per bbl of oil  and per mcf of gas 
average sales prices in  before realized gain loss on derivative contracts were per bbl of oil  and per mcf of gas 
lease operating expense and production taxes 
loe increased from million in to million in the increase in loe was primarily due to the properties acquired from st 
mary in january of as well as an increase in ad valorem and severance taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased from million in to million in loe related to the properties acquired in the st 
mary property acquisition added million to loe during loe per boe for the year ended december  was per boe compared to for the same period of the increase per boe was attributable to the increase in the number of oil wells as a result of the st 
mary acquisition  which are generally more expensive to operate than gas wells  as well as the overall increase in costs 
g a expense 
g a expense  excluding stock based compensation  increased from million in to million in the increase in g a was primarily due to higher personnel expenses associated with additional staff added to manage the properties acquired from st 
mary 
g a per boe was for compared to for the same period of the decrease per boe was attributable to the higher g a expense being offset by higher production volumes during as compared to stock based compensation 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
in addition to options  restricted shares of common stock have been granted 
for the year ended december  and  stock based compensation was approximately million and  respectively 
dd a expense 
dd a expense increased from million in to million in the increase in dd a was primarily the result of increased production as well as an increase in the depletion base as a result of the st 
mary acquisition 
our dd a expense per boe for was per boe as compared to per boe in the per boe increase was due to the increased production volumes in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in long term debt incurred with the st 
mary acquisition 
long term debt as of december  was million compared to million as of december  income taxes 
no current or deferred income tax expense or benefit has been recognized due to losses or loss carryforwards and valuation allowance  which has been recorded against such benefits 
income loss from derivative contracts 
we account for derivative contract gains and losses based on realized and unrealized amounts 
the realized derivative gains or losses are determined by actual derivative settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of derivative contracts in place 
our derivative contract transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting as prescribed by asc  therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contracts are recognized in earnings during the current period 
our derivative contracts consist of commodity swaps and interest rate swaps 
the estimated unearned value of our derivative contracts was an asset of approximately million as of december  when our derivative contract prices are higher than prevailing market prices  we incur realized and unrealized gains and conversely  when our derivative contract prices are lower than prevailing market prices  we incur realized and unrealized losses 
for the year ended december   we realized a loss on our derivative contracts of million and an unrealized gain of million 
for the year ended december   we realized a gain on our derivative contracts of million and we incurred an unrealized loss of million 
other expense 
for the year ended december  as the result of the exchange and registration rights agreement whereby partnership unitholders  under certain circumstances could convert their partnership units into abraxas common stock  we recognized an expense of million  including approximately  relating to shares converted during the fourth quarter of and million representing the fair value of potential conversions

if the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties exceeds the ceiling limit  we are subject to a ceiling limitation write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation write down is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such write downs do impact the amount of our stockholders equity 
the cost ceiling  under sec rules in effect at the time  represents the present value discounted at of net cash flows from sales of future production  using commodity prices on the last day of the year  or alternatively  if prices subsequent to that date have increased  a price near the periodic filing date of the our financial statements 
as of december   our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million 
these amounts were calculated considering year end prices of per bbl for oil and per mcf for gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for our oil and gas reserves as compared to the full cost pool 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas assets increases when oil and gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our gas 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved reserves are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may be required 
non controlling interest 
non controlling interest represents the share of the net income loss of the partnership for the period owned by the partners other than abraxas 
additionally  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect at the time  when cumulative losses applicable to the non controlling interest exceed the non controlling interest equity capital in the entity  such excess and any further losses applicable to the non controlling interest are charged to the earnings of the controlling interest 
if future earnings are recognized by the non controlling interest  such earnings will then be credited to the controlling interest abraxas to the extent of such losses previously absorbed and any excess earnings will increase the recorded value 
for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the ceiling test impairment  losses applicable to the non controlling interest exceeded the controlling interest equity capital by million and  as a result  million of the non controlling interest loss in excess of equity was charged to earnings and was reflected as a reduction of the loss applicable to the non controlling interest 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the oil and gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following costs the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  acquisition of interests in additional oil and gas properties  and production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital expenditures we are able to make has a direct impact on our ability to increase cash flow from operations and  thereby  will directly affect our ability to service our debt obligations and to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
our principal sources of capital going forward will be cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  cash on hand  proceeds from the sale of properties  and if an opportunity presents itself  the sale of debt or equity securities  although we may not be able to complete any financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
working capital deficit 
at december   our current liabilities of million exceeded our current assets of million resulting in working capital deficit of million 
this compares to working capital deficit million as of december  current liabilities as of december  consisted of trade payables of million  revenues due third parties of million  other accrued liabilities of million  current derivative liabilities of million and current maturities of long term debt of million 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands expenditure category exploration development acquisition facilities and other total during  capital expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties and a deposit for the st 
mary property acquisition that closed in january during capital expenditures included million for the acquisition of the st 
mary properties and other smaller acquisitions  as well as the development of our oil and gas properties 
during  capital expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties 
we anticipate making capital expenditures for of million 
these anticipated expenditures are subject to adequate cash flow from operations and availability under our credit facility 
if these sources of funding do not prove to be sufficient  we may also issue additional shares of equity securities or sell debt securities  although we may not be able to complete any financi ngs on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to make all of our budgeted capital expenditures will also be subject to availability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and services 
our capital expenditures could also include expenditures for the acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
there has been a significant decline in oil and gas prices since the second quarter of  while oil prices improved during the second half of  gas prices remain fairly weak 
should the prices of oil and gas decline and if our costs of operations increase or if our production volumes decrease  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset oil and gas production decreases caused by natural field decli nes and sales of producing properties 
sources of capital 
the net funds provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities total operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash 
net income plus non cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities and the monetization of our derivative contracts accounted for most of these funds 
financing activities used million for the year ended december  which was predominately the reduction of long term debt 
investing activities used million in for the development of our oil and gas properties 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash 
net income plus non cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for most of these funds  including the non cash proved property impairment of million 
financing activities provided million for the year ended december   including proceeds of long term borrowing in connection with the st 
mary acquisition 
investing activities used million in  including million for the st 
mary acquisition as well as the development of our oil and gas properties 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash 
net income plus non cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for most of these funds 
financing activities provided million for the year ended december   including proceeds from the issuance of common stock  proceeds from the sale of common units of the partnership and proceeds from the partnership s and abraxas credit facilities 
investing activities used million during the year ended december   including million for the development of our oil and gas properties and million for the st 
mary property acquisition that was completed in january future capital resources 
our principal sources of capital are cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  cash on hand  proceeds from the sale of properties  and if an opportunity presents itself  the sale of debt or equity securities  although we may not be able to complete financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
cash from operating activities is dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes 
oil and gas prices are volatile and declined significantly during the second half of and continued to decline during the first part of oil prices have strengthened during the second half of and while gas prices have strengthened somewhat  they remain weak 
the decline in commodity prices h as significantly reduced our cash flow from operations 
as the result of the global recession  commodity prices may stay depressed which could further reduce our cash flows from operations 
this could cause us to alter our business plans  including reducing our exploration and development plans 
our cash flow from operations will also depend upon the volume of oil and gas that we produce 
unless we otherwise expand reserves  our production volumes may decline as reserves are produced 
in the future we may continue to sell non core producing properties  which could further reduce our production volumes 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we believe our numerous drilling opportunities will allow us to increase our production volumes  however  our drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil and gas rese rvoirs will be found 
if our proved reserves decline in the future  our production will also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations and the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facility will also decline 
the risk of not finding commercially productive reservoirs will be compounded by the fact that of our total estimated proved reserves at december  were classified as undeveloped 
we could also seek capital through the sale of debt and equity securities 
the current state of the equity and debt markets will have a significant impact on our ability to sell debt or equity securities on terms as favorable as those which existed prior to the current crisis 
contractual obligations 
we are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements long term debt operating leases for office facilities below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due in twelve month periods ending contractual obligations in thousands total december  december december thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt lease obligations total these amounts represent the balances outstanding under our credit facility 
these repayments assume that we will not borrow additional funds 
interest expense assumes the balances of long term debt at the end of the period and current effective interest rates 
lease on office space in calgary  alberta  which expires on august  we maintain a reserve for costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
at december   our reserve for these obligations totaled million for which no contractual commitments exist 
for additional information relating to this obligation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contingencies 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
at december  we were not engaged in any legal proceedings that are expected  individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on us

we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and gas 
in the past  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  sales of properties  sales of production payments and borrowings under our credit facilities and other sources 
given our high degree of operating control  the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures is largely within our discretion

in connection with the merger  we refinanced  amended and restated the partnership credit facility  the subordinated credit agreement and abraxas previous credit facility and we borrowed million under the credit facility  of which million was borrowed under the revolving portion and million was borrowed under the term loan portion of the credit facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolving portion of the credit facility and milli on was outstanding under the term loan portion of the facility 
the revolving portion of the credit facility has a maximum commitment of million and availability under the revolving portion of the credit facility will be subject to a borrowing base 
the borrowing base under the revolving portion of the credit facility is currently million and will be determined semi annually by the lenders based upon our reserve reports  one of which must be prepared by our independent petroleum engineers and one of which may be prepared internally 
the amount of the borrowing base will be calculated by the lenders based upon their valuation of our proved reserves utilizing these reserve reports and their own internal decisions 
in addition  the lenders  in their sole discretion  will be able to make one additional borrowing base redetermination during any six month period between scheduled redeterminations and we will be able to request one redetermination during any six month period between scheduled redeterminations 
the lenders will also be able to make a redetermination in connection with any sales of producing properties with a market value of or more of our then current borrowing base and in connection with any hedge termination which could reduce the collateral value by or more 
our borrowing base of million was determined based upon our reserve report dated june  our borrowing base can never exceed the million maximum commitment amount

at december   the interest rate on the term loan portion of the credit facility was 
the term loan portion of the credit facility is subject to amortization beginning on january  the first amortizati on installment of million is due on january  and the second amortization installment of million is due on march   thereafter  a quarterly amortization installment of million is due at the end of each quarter until the term loan is repaid 
it is anticipated that the term loan will be repaid on or before december   after which  it may not be redrawn 
the term loan portion of the credit facility was paid down to million at december  and on january  an additional million was paid 
the balance of the term portion of the credit facility was million as of january subject to earlier termination rights and events of default  the stated maturity date of the credit facility is october  interest is payable quarterly on reference rate advances and not less than quarterly on eurodollar advances 
we are permitted to terminate the credit facility and are able  from time to time  to permanently reduce the lenders aggregate commitment under the credit facility in compliance with certain notice and dollar increment requirements 
each of our subsidiaries other than canadian abraxas petroleum corporation has guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis 
obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest  subject to certain permitted encumbrances  in all of our and our subsidiary guarantors material property and assets 
under the credit facility  we are subject to customary covenants  including certain financial covenants and reporting requirements 
we are required to maintain a current ratio as of the last day of each quarter of not less than to and an interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter of not less than to 
we are also required to maintain a total debt to ebitdax ratio as of the last day of each quarter of not more than to for the quarter ending september  through the quarter ending september   and not more than to thereafter 
the current ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities 
for the purposes of this calculation  current assets include the portion of the borrowing base which is undrawn but excludes any cash deposited with or at the request of a counter party to a hedging arrangement and any assets representing a valuation account arising from the application of asc which relates to derivative instruments and hedging activities and was previously referred to as sfas and asc which relates to asset retirement obligations previously referred to as sfas and curre nt liabilities exclude the current portion of long term debt and any liabilities representing a valuation account arising from the application of asc and asc the interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated ebitdax to consolidated interest expense for the four fiscal quarters ended on the calculation date after giving pro forma effect to the merger 
for the purposes of this calculation  ebitdax is consolidated net income plus interest expense  oil and gas exploration expenses  taxes  depreciation  amortization  depletion and other non cash charges including non cash charges resulting from the application of asc which relates to stock based compensation and was previously referred to as sfas r  asc and asc plus all realized net cash proceeds arising from the settlement or monetization of any hedge contracts or upon the termination of any hedge contract minus all non cash items of income which were included in determining consolidated net income  including all non cash items resulting from the application of asc and asc interest expense includes total interest  letter of credit fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with any debt 
the total debt to ebitdax ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitdax for the four fiscal quarters ended on the calculation date after giving pro forma effect to the merger 
for the purposes of this calculation  total debt is the outstanding principal amount of debt  excluding debt associated with the office building  and obligations with respect to surety bonds and hedge arrangements 
the credit facility also required that we enter into hedging arrangements for specified volumes  which equate to approximately of the estimated oil and gas production from our net proved developed producing reserves through december  and for we satisfied this requirement by assuming all of the partnership s derivative contracts in connection with the merger 
the following table sets forth our derivative contract position as of december  fixed price swap oil gas contract periods daily volume bbl swap price daily volume mmbtu swap price in addition to the foregoing and other customary covenants  the credit facility contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  transfer or sell assets  create liens on assets  engage in transactions with affiliates other than on an arm s length basis  make any change in the principal nature of our business  and permit a change of control 
the credit facility also contains customary events of default  including nonpayment of principal or interest  violations of covenants  cross default and cross acceleration to certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and material judgments and liabilities 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  as of december   the current ratio was to  the interest coverage ratio was to and the total debt to ebitdax ratio was to

hedging activities our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
under the terms of the partnership credit facility  the partnership entered into derivative contracts  which we sometimes refer to as hedging arrangements for specified volumes  which equated to approximately of the estimated oil and gas production through december  from its net proved developed producing reserves 
on july   the derivative contracts for the periods through were monetized for million and together with the july commodity swap settlement of million  the partnership repaid million of indebtedness under the partnership credit agreement on july  simultaneously  the partnership entered into new commodity swaps on approximately of its estimated oil and gas production from its net proved developed producing reserves through december  and on for the calendar year as a result of the merger  all of the partnership s derivative contracts were assumed by abraxas 
the following table sets forth our derivative contract position as of december  fixed price swaps oil gas contract period daily volume bbl swap price daily volume mmbtu swap price by removing a significant portion of price volatility on our future oil and gas production  we believe that we will mitigate  but not eliminate  the potential effects of changing commodity prices on our cash flow from operations 
however  when prevailing market prices are higher than our contract prices  we will not realize increased cash flow on the portion of the production that has been hedged 
we have sustained  and in the future will sustain  realized and unrealized losses on our derivative contracts if market prices are higher than our contract prices 
conversely  when prevailing market prices are lower than our contract prices  we will sustain realized and unrealized gains on our commodity derivative contracts 
for example  in  we sustained an unrealized loss of million and a realized gain of million and in we incurred a realized loss of million and an unrealized gain of million 
for the year ended december   we incurred a realized gain of approximately million and an unrealized loss of approximately million on all of our commodity derivative contracts 
if the disparity between our new contract prices and market prices continues  we will sustain realized and unrealized gains or losses on our derivative contracts 
while unrealized gains and losses do not impact our cash flow from operations  realized gains and losses do impact our cash flow from operations 
in addition  as our derivative contracts expire over time  we expect to enter into new derivative contracts at then current market prices 
if the prices at which we hedge future production are significantly lower than our existing derivative contracts  our future cash flow from operations would likely be materially lower 
in addition  the borrowings under our new credit facility will bear interest at floating rates 
if interest expense increases as a result of higher interest rates or increased borrowings  more cash flow from operations would be used to meet debt service requirements 
as a result  we would need to increase our cash flow from operations in order to fund the development of our numerous drilling opportunities which  in turn  will be dependent upon the level of our production volumes and commodity prices 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging sensitivity for further information 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had  subject to the limitation discussed below  million of net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards will expire through if not utilized 
uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under asc therefore  we have established a valuation allowance of million for deferred tax assets at december  we account for uncertain tax positions under provisions of asc asc did not have any effect on the company s financial position or results of operations as of january  or for the year ended december  the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
as of december   the company did not have any accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the tax years from through remain open to examination by the tax jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
related party transactions abraxas has adopted a policy that transactions between abraxas and its officers  directors  principal stockholders  or affiliates of any of them  will be on terms no less favorable to abraxas than can be obtained on an arm s length basis in transactions with third parties and must be approved by the vote of at least a majority of the disinterested directors 
environmental regulations various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  affect our operations and costs as a result of their effect oil and gas exploration  development and production operations 
these laws and regulations could cause us to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances  including oil  into the environment 
in addition  we have acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control  and under environmental laws and regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or opera tors 
we also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning  and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
in addition  we could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator 
moreover  we are subject to the united states environmental protection agency s us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  but has not had  to date  a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  results of operations or competitive position 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to our total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations  but  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on our operations  financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
we are aware of the increasing focus of local  state  national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues 
in addition to the us epa s rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions  we are also aware of legislation proposed by united states lawmakers to reduce ghg emissions 
we are unable to predict the timing  scope and effect of any such proposed laws  regulations and treaties  but the direct and indirect costs of such laws  regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and competitive position 
we believe that our strategy to reduce ghg emissions throughout our operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice 
we will continue to review the risks to our business and operations associated with all environmental matters  including climate change 
in addition  we will continue to monitor and assess any new policies  legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions  where necessary 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities but do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical c osts and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on our oil and gas properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
we have experienced this situation several times over the years  most recently in our oil and gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from impairment testing procedures associated with the full cost method of accounting as discussed below 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a pool by pool basis  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties and the cost of properties not being amortized  less income taxes 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases whe n oil and gas prices are depressed 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
we apply the full cost ceiling test on a quarterly basis on the date of the latest balance sheet presented 
estimates of proved oil and gas reserves 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report was predominately based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
for the year ended december   oil and gas prices were based on the average month first day of the month pricing as compared to end of period prices in prior years 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
asset retirement obligations 
the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
accounting for derivatives 
we account for derivative gains and losses based on realized and unrealized amounts 
the realized derivative gains or losses are determined by actual derivative settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of derivative contracts in place 
our derivative contract transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting as prescribed by asc  therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contract are recognized in earnings during the current period 
our derivative contracts consist of commodity swaps and interest rate swaps 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations c an be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  and  the net market value of our oil and gas derivatives was a net asset of million and a liability of million  respectively 
the market value of our interest rate derivative was a liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
share based payments 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
additional information about management s assumptions can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
restricted stock awards are awards of common stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer and to a risk of forfeiture if the awardee terminates employment with the company prior to the lapse of the restrictions 
the value of such stock is determined using th e market price on the grant date 
for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation was approximately  million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission adopted rule changes to modernize its oil and gas reporting disclosures 
the changes are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
the updated disclosure requirements are designed to align with current practices and changes in technology that have taken place in the oil and gas industry since the adoption of the original reporting requirements more than years ago 
new disclosure requirements include permitting the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
enabling companies to additionally disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
allowing previously excluded resources  such as oil sands  to be classified as oil and gas reserves 
requiring companies to report on the independence and qualifications of a preparer or auditor and requiring companies to file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserves audit 
requiring companies to report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than the year end price to maximize the comparability of reserve estimates among companies and mitigate the distortion of the estimates that arises when using a single pricing date 
in december  we adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements which conforms the definition of proved reserves with the sec modernization of oil and gas reporting rules which were issued by the sec 
the use of month average prices  as opposed to year end prices  in calculating the present value of our reserves  resulted in a reduction of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of approximately million and  mboe at december  additionally  the change resulted in a  increase in dd a expense in the fourth quarter of in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent oil and gas producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of oil and gas 
declines in commodity prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatil ity is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december   a decline in oil and gas  prices would have reduced our operating revenue and cash flow by approximately million for the year  however  due to the derivative contracts that we have in place  it is unlikely that a decline in commodity prices from their current levels would significantly impact our operating revenue  cash flow and net income 
derivative instrument sensitivity we account for our derivative instruments in accordance with asc  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
in  we elected not to designate our derivative instruments as hedges 
accordingly the instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the market value of the derivatives being recorded in current derivative income loss 
on july   our commodity based derivative contracts for the periods through were monetized for million 
these funds  together with million from the july commodity swap settlement  were used by the partnership to repay million of outstanding indebtedness under the partnership credit facility 
in connection with the monetization and repayment  the partnership was required to enter into new commodity swaps 
as a result of the merger  all of the partnership s derivative contracts were assumed by us
