the increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to timing differences between book expense and cash payments  including a million increase in the tivo litigation accrual and a million increase in cash flow related to working capital changes and other long term operating assets 
the decrease in purchases of property and equipment in was primarily attributable to a decline in expenditures for satellite construction  and equipment under our lease program for existing subscribers  partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers

the decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to increases in cash outflows of million resulting from changes in accounts payable  accounts receivable  income tax receivable  deferred revenue and inventories  partially offset by a million increase in net amounts payable to echostar 
the decrease in purchases of property and equipment in was primarily attributable to a decline in expenditures for satellite construction  corporate capital expenditures  and equipment under our lease program for new subscribers  partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our lease program for existing subscribers 
cash flows from operating activities 
we typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows from operating activities of billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
see discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in free cash flow above 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  strategic investments and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  capital expenditures for new and existing customer equipment totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of billion primarily resulted from a net increase in purchases of marketable investment securities  a decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments and an increase in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments 
the overall net increases were partially offset by cash used for purchases of fcc licenses during and a decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment during compared to 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from a net decrease in purchases of marketable investment securities  a decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment  a decrease in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments  including sling media  and an increase in proceeds from the sale of investments 
the overall net decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash used for purchases of fcc licenses during compared to cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt  cash used for the repurchase  redemption or payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations  dividends paid on our class a and class b common stock and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the year ended december   we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of million 
for the years ended december  and  we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of billion and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash inflows from to primarily resulted from a decrease in the repayment of long term debt and capital lease obligations  an increase in the net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt and a decline in stock repurchases 
this increase in net cash inflows was partially offset by the dividend payment of million during in addition  the cash outflows were negatively impacted by the distribution to echostar related to the spin off 
the increase in net cash outflows from to includes an increase in cash outflows for debt redemptions  distributions related to the spin off and stock repurchases 
this increase in net cash outflows was partially offset by an increase in cash inflows related to issuance of new debt during other liquidity items mhz spectrum in  we paid million to acquire certain mhz wireless licenses  which were granted to us by the fcc in february to commercialize these licenses and satisfy fcc build out requirements  we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others 
depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build out  any such investment or partnership could vary significantly 
part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy fcc build out requirements 
we are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance 
subscriber churn dish network added approximately  net new subscribers for the year ended december   compared to losing approximately  net subscribers during the same period in this increase primarily resulted from an increase in gross new subscribers and a decrease in our subscriber churn rate to compared to for the same period in see results of operations above for further discussion 
our distribution relationship with at t was a substantial contributor to our gross and net subscriber additions in prior years  accounting for approximately of our gross subscriber additions for the year ended december  this distribution relationship ended january  consequently  beginning with the second quarter  at t no longer contributed to our gross subscriber additions 
in addition  nearly one million of our current subscribers were acquired through our distribution relationship with at t and subscribers acquired through this channel have historically churned at a higher rate than our overall subscriber base 
although at t is not permitted to target these subscribers for transition to another pay tv service and we and at t are required to maintain bundled billing and cooperative customer service for these subscribers  these subscribers may continue to churn at higher than historical rates following termination of the at t distribution relationship 
satellites operation of our subscription television service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer 
moreover  current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming  particularly by expanding local hd coverage and offering more hd national channels 
while 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity 
security systems increases in theft of our signal  or our competitors signals  could in addition to reducing new subscriber activations  also cause subscriber churn to increase 
we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards  called smart cards  or security chips in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content security access devices 
our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures  such as security access device replacement programs and updates in security software  that are intended to make signal theft more difficult 
it has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft 
during the second quarter of  we completed the replacement of our security access devices that re secured our system 
however  we expect additional future replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system s security is compromised 
stock repurchases our board of directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to billion of our class a common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million 
on november   our board of directors extended the plan and authorized an increase in the maximum dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the plan  such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding shares through and including december  subscriber acquisition and retention costs we incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers  including advertising  retailer incentives  equipment  installation  and new customer promotions 
while we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription  there can be no assurance that we will 
we deploy business rules such as credit requirements and commitments to receive service for a minimum term  and we strive to provide outstanding customer service  to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their dish network service over longer periods of time 
our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period 
we incur significant costs to retain our existing customers  mostly by upgrading their equipment to hd and dvr receivers 
as with our subscriber acquisition costs  our retention spending includes the cost of equipment and installation 
in certain circumstances  we also offer free programming and or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment 
a component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move 
our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period 
other we are also vulnerable to fraud  particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers 
while we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions  including eliminating certain payment options for subscribers  there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud which could impact our subscriber growth and churn 
the weak economic conditions may create greater incentive for signal theft and subscriber fraud  which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued obligations and future capital requirements contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   future maturities of our debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period total thereafter in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations interest expense on long term debt and capital lease obligations satellite related obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the table above does not include million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits which were accrued  as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  and are included on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  we do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months 
in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 
we have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities  which are included in the table above 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for details 
other than the guarantees disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  we generally do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
satellite related obligations satellites under construction 
as of december   we had entered into the following contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next year 
future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under satellite related obligations except where noted below 
echostar xiv 
during  we entered into a contract for the construction of echostar xiv  a dbs satellite  which was shipped from the manufacturer to the launch site and is scheduled for launch in early echostar xv 
during  we entered into a contract for the construction of echostar xv  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed in mid in addition  we have agreed to lease capacity on two satellites from echostar that are currently under construction 
future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under satellite related obligations 
quetzsat during  we entered into a ten year transponder service agreement with echostar to lease capacity on quetzsat  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed during echostar xvi 
during december  we entered into a ten year transponder service agreement with echostar to lease capacity on echostar xvi  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed during 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued satellite insurance we currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own 
we do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment  digital broadcast operations  satellite and transponder leases  engineering and for products and services related to the operation of our dish network 
our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
programming contracts in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content 
these programming commitments are not included in the contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements table above 
the terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases 
our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing in our subscriber base 
in addition  our margins may face further downward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms 
future capital requirements we expect to fund our future working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations  existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  and cash generated through new additional capital 
the amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies  depending on  among other things  the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention  including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs 
the majority of our capital expenditures for are driven by the costs associated with subscriber premises equipment  included in our firm purchase obligations  as well as capital expenditures for our satellite related obligations 
these expenditures are necessary to operate and maintain the dish network television service 
consequently  we consider them to be non discretionary 
the amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives  including our plans to expand our national and local hd offerings and other strategic opportunities that may arise from time to time 
our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time  and could increase materially as a result of increased competition  significant satellite failures  or continued weak economic conditions 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
if we are unsuccessful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with tivo on reasonable terms  we would be required to eliminate dvr functionality in all but approximately  digital set top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set top boxes with dvr functionality 
in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality  which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers 
furthermore  the inability to offer dvr functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of dish network services 
the adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the district court s contempt order is upheld is 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued likely to be significant 
additionally  the supplemental damage award of million and further award of approximately million does not include damages  contempt sanctions or interest for the period after june in the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal  we could also have to pay substantial additional damages  contempt sanctions and interest 
depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement  we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital 
therefore  any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us  which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives 
we believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings 
if we are successful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes tivo s patent  we could be prohibited from distributing dvrs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then current dvr functionality in some or all set top boxes in the field 
in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality and the adverse effect on our business could be material 
we could also have to pay substantial additional damages 
because both we and echostar are defendants in the tivo lawsuit  we and echostar are jointly and severally liable to tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the district court 
we have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the spin off to indemnify echostar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit 
echostar has agreed to contribute an amount equal to its million intellectual property liability limit under the receiver agreement 
we and echostar have further agreed that echostar s million contribution would not exhaust echostar s liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the receiver agreement 
we and echostar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of  and a cross license to use  any intellectual property developed in connection with any potential new alternative technology 
from time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products  enhance our technical capabilities  improve or sustain our competitive position  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
we may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video  iptv  data and voice services 
future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital  assume third party debt or incur other long term obligations 
in  we paid million to acquire certain mhz wireless licenses  which were granted to us by the fcc in february to commercialize these licenses and satisfy fcc build out requirements  we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others 
depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build out  any such investment or partnership could vary significantly 
part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy fcc build out requirements 
we are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance 
recent developments in the financial markets have made it more difficult for issuers of high yield indebtedness  such as us  to access capital markets at acceptable terms 
these developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position 
a portion of our investment portfolio is invested in auction rate securities  mortgage backed securities  and strategic investments and as a result a portion of our portfolio has restricted liquidity 
liquidity in the markets for these investments has been impacted in the past year and these market conditions have adversely affected our liquidity 
in addition  certain of these securities have defaulted or have been materially downgraded  causing us to record impairment charges 
if the credit ratings of these securities further deteriorate or the lack of liquidity in the marketplace becomes prolonged  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
moreover  the current significant volatility of domestic and global financial markets has greatly affected the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities 
to the extent we require access to funds  we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions  record further impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit ratings our current credit ratings are ba and bb on our long term senior notes as rated by moody s investor service moody s and standard and poor s s p rating service  respectively 
debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
according to moody s  a ba rating indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk 
according to s p  a bb rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues 
however  the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial  or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
capitalized satellite receivers 
since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs  we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale 
such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment  which is based on  among other things  management s judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence 
because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate  the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on  among other things  historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions 
changes in estimated useful life may impact depreciation and amortization on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
for example  if we decreased the estimated useful life of our capitalized subscriber equipment by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge in other  net within other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
weak economic conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments  including mortgage backed securities mbs and auction rate securities ars 
for certain of these instruments  there is no or limited observable market data 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available 
we make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date  credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for example  as of december   we held million of securities that lack observable market quotes  and a decrease in our estimated fair value of these securities would result in a decrease of the reported amount by approximately million 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
we evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of indefinite lived and long lived assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
among other reasons  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
while our impairment tests in indicated the fair value of our intangible assets were significantly above their carrying amounts  significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of indefinite lived and long lived assets  on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
a decrease in the estimated future cash flows or a increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets while all other assumptions remain unchanged would not result in these assets being impaired 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
any such valuation allowance is recorded in either income tax provision benefit  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit on our consolidated balance sheets 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax provision benefit  net  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period to general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements revenue recognition multiple deliverable arrangements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  asu will have on our consolidated financial statements  when adopted  as required  on january  seasonality historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year  as is typical in the pay tv service industry 
however  we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures 
backlog we do not have any material backlog of our products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments our investments and debt are exposed to market risks  discussed below 
cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of billion 
of that amount  a total of billion was invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
the value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses  however  this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer 
interest rate risk a change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio 
based on our december  current non strategic investment portfolio of billion  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued million in fair value of this portfolio 
we normally hold these investments to maturity  however  the hypothetical loss in fair value would be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended december  of 
a change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at different rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
strategic marketable investment securities as of december   we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are held for strategic and financial purposes  are concentrated in a small number of companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
in general  the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
restricted cash and marketable investment securities and noncurrent marketable and other investment securities restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in a cash  b debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  c commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and d instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
based on our december  investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities 
noncurrent auction rate and mortgage backed securities as of december   we held investments in auction rate securities ars and mortgage backed securities mbs of million  which are reported at fair value 
events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for certain of our ars and mbs investments 
as a result  we classify these investments as noncurrent assets as we intend to hold these investments until they recover or mature  and therefore interest rate risk associated with these securities is mitigated 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
other investment securities as of december   we had million of nonpublic debt and equity instruments that we hold for strategic business purposes 
we account for these investments under the cost  equity and fair value methods of accounting 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these nonpublic debt and equity instruments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued fixed rate debt  mortgages and other notes payable as of december   we had fixed rate debt  mortgages and other notes payable of billion on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately billion using quoted market prices for our publicly traded debt  which constitutes approximately of our debt 
the fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
to the extent interest rates increase  our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
derivative financial instruments in general  we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes  but we may do so in the future
