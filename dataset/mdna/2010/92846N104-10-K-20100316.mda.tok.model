additionally  we have been impacted by weakness in the high end computed tomography  or ct  and picture archiving and communication systems  or pacs  markets 
we mitigated these negative factors through significant cost control measures  while continuing to make strategic investments

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
table of contents describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below reflect significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors  including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific client reserves and the aging of our outstanding receivables 
a portion of this provision is included in operating expenses as a general and administrative expense and a portion of this provision is included as a reduction of license revenue 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors utilized in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be necessary in the period such determination has been made  which would impact future results of operations 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  for gross accounts receivable of million 
deferred taxes significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
considerations for determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets primarily involve cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes  cumulative taxable income for the past three years  estimated future pre tax income for financial reporting purposes and estimated future taxable income from our core business 
we also consider the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits  and estimate the impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
after giving consideration to the above factors  during the three months ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million to the provision for income taxes to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if pretax results improve in future periods  we may be able to utilize the deferred tax assets to reduce tax payments 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
under this accounting guidance  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we operate as one reporting unit and therefore compare the book value to the market value consisting of market capitalization plus a control premium of 
as of december   we had million shares outstanding  a closing stock price of per share  a market value of million  and a book value of million  which would indicate that our goodwill of million was not impaired 
if the market value exceeds the book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if our book value exceeds the market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
if market conditions continue to fluctuate  we may incur goodwill impairment charges that adversely affect our financial position and operating results 

table of contents revenue recognition we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
significant judgment is also required when evaluating and assessing revenue recognition relating to our distribution agreements with original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers and independent distributors collectively  resellers 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which must be analyzed to determine the fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
as a result  if facts and circumstances change that affect our current judgments  our revenue could be materially different in the future 
equity based compensation we recognize equity based compensation expense under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
we recognize equity based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are input into the model 
these assumptions are the expected stock volatility  the risk free interest rate  the option s expected life and the dividend yield on the underlying stock 
expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected option life and other appropriate factors 
risk free interest rates are calculated based on continuously compounded us treasury risk free rates for the appropriate term 
prior to march   the expected life of stock options was calculated by performing a detailed analysis of all historical stock option information available 
on march   we began to grant options with a five year legal life instead of the eight year legal life that had historically been used 
as a result  we elected to use the simplified method  to estimate the expected life of options granted on and after march  we will utilize the simplified method until sufficient historical information becomes available on the five year legal life options 
the dividend yield is assumed to be zero  as we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the expected forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards require the input of the subjective assumptions described above 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards represent management s best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of equity based compensation

as was the case in and  we expect that in future periods  although sales of our enterprise offering will result in proportionately lower license revenue upon sale  we will benefit from a recurring revenue stream from maintenance and services contracts 
the increase in maintenance and support revenue in  compared to  was due to an increase in the number of customers on maintenance contracts resulting from additional license sales 
the increase in maintenance and support revenue in  compared to  was primarily driven by an increase in the number of customers on maintenance contracts  resulting from both additional license sales and improvement in the percentage of our existing customers on maintenance contracts 
an overall decrease in the number of license sales in and  as compared to and  respectively  contributed to lower customer education revenue in both and professional services revenue  which includes installation and other implementation related services  increased in and  due to increases in professional services resulting from sales of our product on an enterprise basis and the timing of services provided 

table of contents hardware revenue hardware revenue increased to million in  compared to million in  which was a increase from million in hardware revenue increased due to the increased sales of our product on an enterprise basis  for which our customers frequently purchase hardware from us

we will continue to invest in our customer education  installation  professional services and customer support areas in the future to adequately support our growing installed base of customers 
we had  and maintenance and services personnel as of december   and  respectively 
gross margin for hardware decreased in  compared to  and increased in  compared to variances in gross margin for hardware are expected  as hardware sales are not a substantial part of the sales strategy 

table of contents during the third quarter  we recognized a  patent impairment charge related to a patent application acquired in the hinnovation  inc acquisition in february this patent application was rejected by the united states patent and trademark office on august   and we decided not to pursue this application further

in  we recognized a credit of million to our research and development expenses for reimbursement from toshiba for development costs we incurred under the co development agreement 
the decrease in other expense categories in  compared to  was primarily due to decreased headcount and other broad based cost control measures 
the major driver of higher research and development expenses in was new product initiatives  resulting in increased consulting expense and increased compensation expense due to higher average headcount in compared to we had  and research and development personnel as of december   and  respectively

the erp system was intended to replace numerous disconnected business management software applications and link the data contained within these disconnected systems to enable better management of our business and derive more useful data for various business functions  such as sales  marketing  finance and customer support 
phase of the implementation  which related to the replacement of our general ledger  was completed in the related capitalized costs are being depreciated over seven years and  as of december   the net book value of phase was  phase of the implementation  which consisted of replacing our various customer relationship management and order processing systems  was put on hold in in conjunction with our cost control efforts  and we did not capitalize any costs relating to phase subsequent to october during the three months ended june   we determined  in conjunction with continued cost control measures  that we would not implement phase as a result  in we recognized an asset impairment charge of million related to the phase implementation 
restructuring charge during  we continued to experience the effects of the industry wide slowdown in the high end ct market and the deficit reduction act that significantly impacted our results 
additionally  in  we were impacted by the general decline in the us economy  which resulted in contracted capital spending by us hospitals and lower interest rates on our cash and investments

in connection with the reduction in workforce  we incurred certain charges in totaling  which were primarily comprised of employee severance and other termination costs 
the following table summarizes and restructuring transactions and related liability balances in thousands severance and other termination costs balance at january  restructuring charges payments balance at december  payments balance at december  actions with respect to the above activities were completed in the fourth quarter of  and we did not incur any significant additional charges in related to the restructuring plan announced in november interest income we generated million of interest income in  compared to million in and million in a decline in interest rates resulted in a return on investments in  compared to a and return on investments in and  respectively 

table of contents interest income is significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
we do not anticipate a significant improvement in interest rates in compared to due to general market conditions  interest rate changes may have a significant impact on results 
income taxes during the three months ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million to the provision for income taxes to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of cumulative pretax results in recent years and projections of cumulative pretax results in future periods 
during  we recognized  in one time tax benefits resulting from tax legislation  which enabled us to receive cash payment for the monetization of certain historic research and development tax credits 
also as a result of the legislation  we recognized a  one time tax benefit related to the refund of certain alternative minimum tax payments in prior years 
for  we anticipate a consolidated tax provision of approximately  per quarter relating entirely to foreign operations 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital debt the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   compared to december   was primarily the result of repurchases of our common stock totaling million under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in and the decrease in working capital during was primarily the result of purchases of noncurrent marketable securities  the balance of which increased million during we believe our existing cash and investments will satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements for at least the next months 
additionally  we believe our liquidity and strong balance sheet enable us to execute our repurchases of common stock while still investing in our enterprise solution and marketing strategy and remaining well positioned to pursue strategic acquisitions if and when they emerge 
we have investments in marketable securities that are classified and accounted for as available for sale 
as of december   million of our marketable securities mature within one year and the remaining million of our marketable securities mature in 
table of contents summary of cash flows a summary of cash flows is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in  compared to million in  due to an million increase in net loss and a million decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities  offset by an million increase in non cash operating items 
the million decrease in net cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to decreased sales and expenses in  compared to  and to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business 
cash provided by non cash operating items increased by million in to million  compared to million in  primarily resulted from a million decrease in deferred tax assets due to a million valuation allowance recorded in the second quarter of and a million asset impairment in the second quarter of net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in to million  compared to million in  due to a million decrease in net income and a million decrease in non cash operating items  offset by a  increase due to the timing of other receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business

we realized million  million and million of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities during  and  respectively 
as of december   the marketable securities consist of us government obligations and corporate commercial obligations 
we used million  million and million for purchases of property and equipment in  and  respectively 
the purchases for all periods were principally to upgrade computer equipment and to purchase computer equipment for new personnel 
purchases for and also included costs related to expanding our facilities 
additionally  in  we began the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system 
we continued implementation of the erp during and  though we recognized an impairment charge related to phase in the second quarter of  as noted in the asset impairment section above 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment in the normal course of business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods are difficult to predict and depend on a number of factors  including the hiring of employees and the rate of change of computer hardware 
financing activities cash used by financing activities totaled million and million in and  respectively  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in the primary use of cash in and was for the 
table of contents repurchase of million and million of our common stock  respectively  under our share repurchase programs 
the cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the exercise of stock options granted under our stock plans and upon the exercise of warrants 
we have never paid or declared any dividends and do not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or purchase commitments we had no significant outstanding purchase commitments as of december  we have entered into a number of technology licensing agreements that provide for the payment of royalties when we sell our software products  we are not obligated for any minimum payments under such agreements 
foreign currency transactions our export sales are primarily negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars  with a portion of sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as we expand our direct business internationally  we expect to enter into a higher percentage of sales transactions in foreign currencies and could be subject to greater gains or losses based on exchange rate fluctuations 
inflation we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we do not enter into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates because  as disclosed above  our export sales are primarily negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars  with a small percentage of sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
based on the controls in place and the relative size of the financial instruments entered into  we believe the risks associated with not using these instruments would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we do not engage in speculative transactions and do not use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 

table of contents in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and price changes  which could affect our operating results 
interest rate risk we place our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with a high quality financial institution and have investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
if  during  average short term interest rates decreased by from average rates  based on our quarterly average balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our interest income from short term investments would have decreased by approximately  foreign currency risk our export sales are primarily negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars  with a portion of sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the dollar as compared to other foreign currencies have not had a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
as we expand our direct business internationally  we expect to enter into a higher percentage of sales transactions in foreign currencies and could be subject to greater gains or losses based on exchange rate fluctuations
