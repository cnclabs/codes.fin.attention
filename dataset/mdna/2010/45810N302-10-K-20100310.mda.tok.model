overview we manage highly specialized outpatient centers in emerging  technology based  niche medical markets 
currently  we are a leading manager of fertility centers and vein clinics in the united states 
we provide services and products through our three operating divisions fertility centers  consumer services and vein clinics and shared support services for providers through our corporate offices 
each of our operating divisions is presented as a separate segment for financial reporting purposes 
our fertility centers division is a provider network of contracted fertility centers  referred to as our partner program  serving metropolitan markets across the united states 
we offer products and services to these providers designed to support the fertility center s growth 
all fertility partners also have full access to our consumer services division offerings 
the division also sponsors a council of physicians and scientists for fertility providers 
physicians affiliated with our partner fertility centers obtain a portion of their malpractice insurance through artic assisted reproductive technology insurance company  a captive insurance company which we helped organize in our consumer services division offers our attain ivf programs to fertility patients 
the division s attain ivf programs are designed to make the treatment process easier and more affordable for patients 
currently  this division maintains a contracted network of independent fertility centers as of december  under its affiliate program  which is designed to distribute the division s products and services to a wider group of patients than those serviced by our partner locations 
our vein clinics division began operations on august   with the purchase of vein clinics of america  inc vca  a company that had been in business since the vein clinics division currently manages a network of clinics as of december  located in states  which specialize in the treatment of vein disease and other vein disorders 
the primary elements of our business strategy include making selective contract acquisitions of partner fertility centers  expanding our network of affiliate fertility centers  developing de novo vein clinics  increasing the total number of patients treated  increasing the penetration of our attain ivf programs  and continuing to improve operating efficiencies 
major events impacting financial condition and results of operations restatement of revenue recognition for attain ivf refund program the following information is presented here for historical reference and does not appear in the financial statements in the form k as this information has been previously presented on form k amendment no 
for filed february  and on form s amendment no 
filed february  these restatements were the result of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of december  we have remediated this material weakness 
restatement no 
the correction of an error on october   management concluded and subsequently reported to the audit committee of our board of directors that our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december    and should no longer be relied upon and will be restated due to an understatement in revenue recognized in connection with its attain ivf refund program 
we had previously restated see restatement no 
correction of an error in revenue recognition policy for the attain ivf refund program below certain financial statements after determining that they could not be relied upon 
specifically  we restated our prior financial statements with respect to the correction of an error in the timing of revenue and profit recognition of  of the revenue related to our attain ivf refund program within our consumer services division for the years through that restatement did not impact the cash flows from operations of this program or the ultimate profits to be recognized  only the timing of the revenue and profit recognition 
subsequent to restatement no 
 we developed  programmed and tested a new patient management and revenue recognition system for our attain ivf refund program 
the new system recently reached sufficient operating proficiency to allow input of the patient information related to our attain ivf refund program 
as a result  we identified that the deferred revenue amount of  related to the years through  that had been previously restated should have been only  we determined that while the previous system properly accounted for the recognition of the proportional fair value revenue related to the non refundable portion of the patient fee which was the subject of a comment and review process by the staff of the division of corporation finance of the securities and exchange commission sec  it assumed all patients would either achieve pregnancy or utilize all services available to them under the program 
it is a fact that most of the patients that seek a refund  do so prior to utilizing all services available under the program 
as a result  our revenue recognition model failed to recognize as revenue the remaining deferred revenue portion of the non refundable fee on that class of patients 
the change in our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations as of and for the twelve months ended december  and related to restatement no 
is presented below s  except per share amounts twelve months ending december  revenue recognized from prior period revenue deferred to future period net change in period revenue revenue as reported net change in reported revenue revenue as restated income before income taxes as reported net change in reported revenue net change in reserve for medical costs income before income taxes as restated income tax provision as reported net change in income taxes from above adjustments income tax provision as restated net income as reported summary of above adjustments net income as restated diluted earnings per share as reported change in earnings per share from above adjustments diluted earnings per share as restated current liabilities as reported cumulative effect of restatement on current liabilities current liabilities as restated shareholders equity as reported cumulative effect of restatement on shareholders equity shareholders equity as restated there was no change to cash flow as a result of this restatement 
restatement no 
correction of an error in revenue recognition policy for the attain ivf program 
the accompanying and consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the correction of an error in the revenue recognition policy for our attain ivf refund program 
our previous revenue recognition policy had generally recognized the non refundable patient fees generally of the contract amount as revenue upon the completion of the first treatment cycle and we now recognize the non refundable fees based on the relationship of the relative fair value of each treatment to the total fair value of the treatment package available to each patient 
we also recognize a warranty reserve representing the estimated cost of services to be provided in the event a qualified patient miscarries 
this restatement does not impact the cash flows from the operations of this program or the ultimate profits to be recognized  only the timing of the revenue recognition for a portion of the fees that we collect from our customers 
the impact of the correction of the error in the timing of revenue recognition for restatement no 
only  is as follows revenue as reported net change in reported revenue revenue as restated income before income taxes as reported net change in reported revenue net change in reserve for medical costs income before income taxes as restated income tax provision as reported net change in income taxes from above adjustments income tax provision as restated net income as reported summary of above adjustments net income as restated diluted earnings per share as reported change in earnings per share from above adjustments diluted earnings per share as restated current liabilities as reported cumulative effect of restatement on liabilities current liabilities as restated shareholders equity as reported cumulative effect of restatement on shareholders equity shareholders equity as restated the cumulative impact of both restatements the cumulative effect of the corrections of errors is to decrease net income in and by  and  respectively

significant accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  including our significant accounting policies  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts and contractual allowance reserves  contingencies and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of net revenues and accounts receivable and reserves for estimated refunds due to pregnancy losses in our attain ivf refund program 
contractual allowance and uncollectible reserve amounts are determined based on historical collection performance data and are reviewed and adjusted monthly as necessary 
we make periodic estimates for pregnancy loss based upon company specific data 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of net revenues represented by various expenses and other income items reflected in our statements of operations for the years ended december   and revenues  net fertility centers consumer services vein clinics total revenues costs of services incurred fertility centers consumer services vein clinics total costs of service contribution fertility centers consumer services vein clinics total contribution general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense total other expenses income from operations before income taxes income tax provision net income our vein clinics division began operations on august  with our purchase of vca 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   total revenues of million increased approximately million  or  from the same period in approximately million of this increase was generated by our vein clinics division  million from our fertility centers division and million from our consumer services division 
the increase in revenues in each of our divisions is attributed to the following in our fertility division the increase was the result of a million rise in same center revenues as well as million of incremental revenues from the addition of new partner contracts in april  july and december in our consumer division the increase of million is due primarily to a combination of increased cycle volumes  slightly higher success rates in as compared to in our vein clinics division two new vein clinics opened during the first quarter of  which  accounted for million of our vein clinics division s increase  the five clinics opened throughout accounted for million of the increase with the remaining million generated by legacy clinics 
for the year ended december   contribution increased from million in the comparable period of to million in  or an increase of  driven primarily by growth in our fertility centers and vein clinics divisions 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   total revenues of million increased approximately million  or  from the year ended december  we experienced year over year organic revenue increases in both of our fertility business segments 
our fertility centers division revenues increased as a result of growth within our existing medical practices  as well as the addition of two new partner arrangements and the full year of results of a partner added in the third quarter of expansion continued in our consumer services division  driven by the continued expansion of our attain ivf refund program 
in addition to growth in our two fertility segments  our performance for the year ended december  included full year results from our vein clinics division which was purchased on august  for the year ended december   total contribution of million was up approximately million  or  from the year ended december  increased contribution in our fertility centers division in was the result of increased profitability in our platform of existing centers as well as the addition of contract acquisition related results 
the continued growth of our attain ivf refund program and full year results from our vein clinics division were also major contributors to the improvement 
a segment by segment discussion is presented below fertility centers segment in providing clinical care to patients  each of our partner fertility centers generates patient revenues which we do not report in our financial statements 
although we do not consolidate the partner fertility center practice financials with our own  these financials do directly affect our revenues 
the components of our revenues from most of the partner fertility centers are a base service fee calculated as a percentage of patient revenues as reported by the partner fertility center this percentage generally varies from down to depending on the agreement and the level of patient revenues  cost of services equal to reimbursement for the expenses which we advanced to the partner fertility center during the month representing substantially all of the expenses incurred by the center  except physician compensation  and our additional fees which represent our share of the net income of the partner fertility center which varies from to or a fixed amount depending on the underlying center  subject to limits in some circumstances 
however  our revenues from our fertility centers of illinois  sc fci partner fertility center are not based on this three part structure 
rather  effective as of november   our revenues from fci are generally equal to the operating expenses associated with managing fci s medical practice plus of such expenses 
our revenues from fci prior to november  were  pursuant to our current partner agreement with fci  set at a fixed annual amount paid monthly 
in addition to these revenues generated from our fertility centers  we often receive miscellaneous other revenues related to providing services to medical practices 
from the total of our revenues  we subtract the annual amortization of our business service rights under most agreements  which are the rights to provide business services to each of the centers 
during  our fertility centers division revenues increased by million  or  relative to the same period in the prior year 
this increase was the result of a million rise in same center revenues as well as million of incremental revenues from the addition of new partner contracts in april  july and december these increases are net of the reduction in business at one of our top fertility centers in the midwest as a result of termination of a contract with one of the center s third party payors  as well as a slight moderation in demand that we believe is attributable to the prolonged recession 
contribution from this facility in was approximately million and this third party payor represented approximately of this contribution or approximately  fertility centers division contribution for the year ended december  rose million  or  from the prior year period based on a rise in revenues 
during  million of contribution was attributable to our new partner fertility centers and million was attributable to our legacy centers 
the rise in contribution  along with improved operating margins  are the result of division wide cost control measures implemented early in fertility centers division revenues in the year ended december  increased by million  or  from the year ended december  this compares to an increase of million  or  for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  during and  growth was largely attributable to same center year over year growth in our network of underlying medical practices 
influencing this growth is our focus on increasing patient revenues through effective multi faceted marketing programs  as well as our continued focus on expense management  which drives operational efficiency and higher contribution margins 
revenues for the year ended december  also benefited from the inclusion of a new fertility partner in mount pleasant  south carolina  which contributed million to our net revenues from its addition in april through december   full year results from our orlando  florida partner added in september  and the full year impact from the expansion of shady grove into the baltimore  maryland market in july in july  we also entered into a year contract with arizona reproductive medicine specialists  based in phoenix  arizona 
under the terms of this agreement  we phased in the implementation of our full suite of partner services over time 
under this arrangement  our fees were originally calculated as a fixed percentage of the center s revenues with an option to expand into our standard three tiered fee structure  in line with expanded partner services  based upon the center meeting certain performance targets 
we exercised this option on april  fertility centers division contribution of million for the year ended december  increased approximately  or  from prior year levels 
although this segment experienced revenue growth of in  versus the prior year  margin growth was tempered by additional division level infrastructure investments 
these investments  which totaled million during  were designed to support continuing growth and new contract acquisitions within this segment 
the table below illustrates the components of the fertility centers division revenues in relation to the partner fertility center practice financials for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  partner fertility center financials a patient revenue b cost of services c base service fee d practice contribution a b c e physician compensation f integramed additional fee integramed financials g integramed gross revenue b c f h amortization of business service rights i other revenue j integramed fertility services revenue g h i i other revenue includes administrative fees we receive from artic  the captive insurance company  fees from arizona reproductive medicine specialists as well as other miscellaneous fees 
the following summarized quarterly data for the years ended december   and is presented for additional analysis and demonstration of the slight seasonality of our fertility centers division 
new patients visits are an indicator of initial patient interest in fertility treatment and ivf cases completed are an indicator of billable charges 
ivf cases completed in the fourth quarter of each year are typically lower  as many patients do not wish to undergo the ivf procedure during the year end holidays 
contributing to the lower number of ivf cases completed are voluntary laboratory closures at year end at several of our labs in order to undergo normal maintenance in thousands  except new patient visits and ivf cases completed 
period ended december  q q q q total revenues  net contribution new patient visits ivf cases completed period ended december  q q q q total revenues  net contribution new patient visits ivf cases completed period ended december  q q q q total revenues  net contribution new patient visits ivf cases completed consumer services segment revenues from our consumer services division increased by  or million  for the year ended december  versus the same period in the prior year 
attain ivf refund program revenues accounted for approximately of the division s revenues during  up slightly from approximately for the same period in patients enrolled in our attain ivf refund program pay us an up front fee deposit in return for up to six treatment cycles consisting of three fresh ivf cycles and three frozen embryo transfers 
any non refundable portion of these fees is recognized as revenue  based on the relative fair value of each treatment cycle completed relative to the total fair value of the contracted treatment package available to the patient 
the refundable portion of the program contract amount is recognized as revenue when the patient becomes pregnant 
at the time of pregnancy  we establish a reserve for future medical costs should the patient miscarry and require additional contracted treatment cycles 
the two main factors that impact attain ivf refund program financial performance are the number of patients enrolled and receiving treatment  and clinical pregnancy rates 
patients enrolled in our attain ivf multi cycle program pay us a single fee  which is slightly less than the average cost of two fresh ivf cycles  in return for up to four treatment cycles consisting of two fresh ivf cycles and two frozen embryo transfers 
our attain ivf multi cycle program offers a refund ranging from to of the contract amount depending on where in the process either we or the patient elects to terminate the program  as long as termination is prior to a second fresh ivf cycle 
with respect to our attain ivf multi cycle program  we recognize a pro rata share of the contract amount as revenue as each treatment cycle is completed 
the refundable portion of the program contract amount is recognized as revenue when the patient becomes pregnant 
under such revenue recognition methodology  we never recognize more revenue than the potential refundable amount under the program 
at the time of pregnancy  we establish a reserve for future medical costs should the patient miscarry and require additional contracted treatment cycles 
the main factor that impacts attain ivf multi cycle program financial performance is the number of patients enrolled and receiving treatment 
during the second quarter of  the loss of a primary third party lender that provided financing programs for attain ivf patients and a general tightening of credit standards and higher interest rates caused a decline in new patient enrollments that adversely affected the program 
in october  we entered into a referral agreement with a new third party lender to provide financing options for attain ivf patients  as well as for certain other fertility treatments 
contribution from our consumer services division for the year ended december  was million versus million in the year earlier period 
this decrease reflects slowing enrollments into the program resulting in part from disruptions in the credit markets which occurred during  which made it more difficult for patients to finance treatments 
our affiliate program generated revenues of million during  about even with that of the prior year period 
although our affiliate program produces revenues on a stand alone basis  the primary value of the affiliate program is to serve as a distribution channel for our attain ivf programs and as an introduction to our services for medical practices that may become full fertility partners 
as of december   this network was comprised of independent fertility centers  more than the year earlier period 
pharmaceutical revenues for the year ended december  were  down from  for the same period in the prior year 
our pharmaceutical revenues are comprised of marketing support fees we earn based upon underlying product margin as reported by a third party pharmaceutical distributor 
over the past several years we have seen flat or declining revenues due to pharmaceutical cost increases which the distributor has been unable to pass on to the consumer as a result of competitive pressures 
we view these pricing and margin developments as longer term structural elements within the pharmaceutical market and do not expect significant improvement during as such we did not renew our contract with the third party distributor when it expired on june  and we anticipate no further revenues from this source during and beyond 
for the year ended december   revenues of million from our attain ivf refund program represented approximately of our consumer services division revenues 
this compares to revenues of million  or  of consumer services division revenues in revenue growth in our attain ivf refund program of million  or  in compared to was the result of enrolling more patients into the program and increasing patient throughput by maintaining high pregnancy success rates 
from the beginning of through the end of  while pregnancy success rates have either been maintained or increased  enrollments in our attain ivf refund program grew at a compound annual rate of 
because the patients in our attain ivf refund program prepay for their suite of services  and a significant portion of the fees received by us are not recognized until the patient achieves pregnancy  our attain ivf refund program deposits and deferred revenue balance continues to grow each year the number of enrolled patients grows 
our affiliate program generated revenues of million for the year ended december   which is approximately unchanged from the years ended december  and during  four independent fertility centers joined our affiliate program and two left in partner related transactions for a net increase of two centers 
for the year ended december   our affiliate program had a net reduction of one center as one practice moved to our partner program 
our affiliate program generated revenues of million for the year ended december   which is approximately unchanged from the years ended december  and during  four independent fertility centers joined our affiliate program and two left in partner related transactions for a net increase of two centers 
for the year ended december   our affiliate program had a net reduction of one center as one practice moved to our partner program

revenues for the year ended december  were million  up  or million from during the  we opened new vein clinic locations in cincinnati and cleveland  marking our entry into the state of ohio and these two markets

for  vein clinics division contribution of million  or of vein clinics division revenues  compared to contribution of million  or of vein clinics division revenues  for the improved performance for the is largely attributable to the additional operational and marketing infrastructure put in place during  combined with increased revenue from both new and previously operated clinics

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of salaries and benefits  administrative  regulatory compliance and operational support costs defined as our shared services group  which are not specifically related to individual center or clinic operations or other product offerings 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase from the million recognized in the prior year 
the increased general and administrative expenses in is attributable to higher service and infrastructure activities designed to provide operational support to our three growing business segments 
we measure our performance in part by relating general and administrative expenses to operating contribution 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were of contribution compared to a ratio of for the year ended december general and administrative expenses totaled million in and million in for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were of contribution as compared to in we continue to actively manage general and administrative expenses in an effort to leverage our shared services group and extract economies of scale as those opportunities arise 
interest net interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to net interest expense of million for the reduction in net interest expense for the year is the result of scheduled debt repayments which reduced our outstanding loan balances combined with lower market interest rates on certain portions of the remaining balances 
net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  the change in net interest income expense between and is primarily the result of utilizing cash on hand and additional borrowings as the principal means of financing our acquisition of vca in august this acquisition used approximately million of cash from our balance sheet in addition to million of new borrowings 
subject to interest rate fluctuations and any changes to our credit arrangements  we anticipate interest expense to decrease gradually in the coming quarters as scheduled debt repayments reduce our outstanding principal balances 
income tax provision our provision for income tax was approximately million  million and million for the three years ended december   and respectively  or  and of pre tax income  respectively 
our effective tax rates for all years reflect provisions for both federal and state income taxes 
the lower effective tax rate of for the year ended december  was mainly due to benefits received from tax exempt interest income 
we expect the effective tax rate to approximate in in july  guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
we adopted this guidance on january   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states 
for federal income tax purposes  our through tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the normal three year statute of limitations 
a federal income tax examination for tax years through was completed during resulting in no adjustment to our income tax liability

off balance sheet arrangements current accounting guidance addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance on accounting for variable interest entities vie 
the new accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods after january  both sets of guidance require continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and requires consolidation if the enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and is the primary beneficiary or obligor of the vie 
as of december   through the acquisition of vein clinics of america  inc  we have interests in the individual vein clinics  where we are the primary beneficiary and obligor of their financial results our contract provides for us to receive any excess or deficit profits from the vein clinics 
as such we have consolidated these vein clinic operations in our financial statements 
since we do not have any financial interest in the individual fertility centers and we are not the primary beneficiary or obligor of their financial results our contracts provide for the physician owners of the clinics to receive any excess or deficit profits  we do not consolidate the results of the fertility centers in our accounts 
also  since we do not have a controlling interest in the captive insurance provider and we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not consolidate the results of the captive insurance company in our accounts 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as compared to million at december  we had a working capital deficit of approximately million  at december   approximately in line with the deficit of million as of december  on february   we announced that we priced an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at an offering price of per share 
this offering raised approximately million in proceeds after underwriting discounts and expenses related to the offering 
the offering closed on february  attain ivf deferred revenue and other patient deposits  which are reflected as a current liability  represent funds received from patients in advance of treatment cycles and are an indication of potential future revenues 
these deposits totaled approximately million and million as december  and  respectively 
the change in deposit level is a function of patient enrollments into the program  less patient through put into our treatment programs 
these deposits are a significant source of cash flow and represent interest free financing for us 
as of december   we did not have any significant contractual commitments for the acquisition of fixed assets or construction of leasehold improvements 
however we anticipate capital acquisition totaling million during the upcoming twelve months 
these expenditures are primarily related to medical equipment  information system infrastructure and leasehold improvements 
we believe that working capital  specifically cash and cash equivalents  including an additional million raised in february from our underwritten offering  remains at adequate levels to fund our operations and our commitments for fixed asset acquisitions 
we also believe that the cash flows from our operations plus our available credit facility will be sufficient to provide for our future liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
in august   we entered into a new financing arrangement with bank of america and secured a million five year term loan 
after deducting the outstanding balance of million on our previous loan amount  interest and fees  our net funding from bank of america was million 
in order to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with this term loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement on of the principal amount effectively fixing the interest rate at  plus the applicable margin  on that portion of the loan 
our swap agreement matures in august and our term loan matures in august we deem this hedge to be highly effective over its term to maturity as it shares the same amortization schedule as the underlying debt subject to the hedge and any change in fair value inversely mimics the appropriate portion of the hedged item 
at the expiration of the swap agreement  or amendment to the term loan  which ever occurs first  we will re evaluate our hedge position and modify our disclosures as necessary 
each component of our amended credit facility bears interest by reference  at our option  to bank of america s prime rate minus a margin or to libor plus a margin 
the margin is dependent upon a leverage test  ranging from to in the case of libor based term loans and to in the case of prime based term loans 
interest on the revolving line of credit is at the prime rate less up to or at libor plus to  depending on a leverage test 
interest on the prime based loans became payable quarterly beginning on november  and interest on libor based loans is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
as of december   interest on the term loan was payable at a rate of approximately 
other features of this credit facility include a million five year revolving line of credit 
availability of borrowings under the working capital revolver is based on eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december  under the revolving line of credit the full amount of million was available  of which million was outstanding 
unused amounts under the working capital revolver bear a commitment fee of and are payable quarterly 
our bank of america credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   we were in full compliance with all applicable debt covenants 
we also continuously review our credit agreements and may renew  revise or enter into new agreements from time to time as deemed necessary 
significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands notes payable line of credit outstanding capital lease obligations interest on debt operating leases fertility partners capital and other obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years in thousands unused lines of credit includes planned  but not yet legally committed capital expenditures at our fertility partner practices we also have commitments to provide working capital financing to member centers in our fertility centers division that are not included in the above table 
a significant portion of these commitments relate to our transactions with the medical practices themselves 
our responsibilities to the these medical practices are to provide financing for their accounts receivable and to hold patient deposits on their behalf  as well as undistributed physician earnings 
disbursements to the medical practices generally occur monthly 
the medical practice s repayment hierarchy consists of the following we provide a cash credit to the practice for billings to patients and insurance companies  we reduce the cash credit for center expenses that we have incurred on behalf of the practice  we reduce the cash credit for the base portion of our service fee which relates to the partner revenues  we reduce the cash credit for the variable portion of our service fee which relates to the partner earnings  and we disburse to the medical practice the remaining cash amount which represents the physician s undistributed earnings 
we are also responsible for the collection of the partner accounts receivables 
we continuously fund these needs from our cash flows from operations  the collection of prior months receivables and deposits from patients in advance of treatment 
if delays in repayment are incurred  which have not as yet been encountered  we could draw on our existing revolving line of credit 
we also make payments on behalf of the partner for which we are reimbursed in the short term 
other than these payments  as a general course  we do not make other advances to the medical practices 
we have no other funding commitments to the partner centers 
recently issued accounting pronouncements please see note under the subheading recently issued accounting pronouncements of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business our interest income and expense items are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
during the third quarter of we entered into an interest rate swap agreement designed to hedge of our million variable interest rate term loan maturing in as a result of this swap transaction we have partially shielded ourselves from a portion of the interest rate risks associated with that portion of the term loan  as the swap transaction essentially converts that portion of the term loan to a fixed rate instrument at plus the applicable margin through the maturity of the swap agreement in august we are currently subject to interest rate risks associated with the remaining of our term loan  as well as our short term investments and certain advances to our fertility centers  all of which are tied to either short term interest rates  libor or the prime rate 
as of both december  and  a change in interest rates would have impacted our pre tax income by approximately  annually
