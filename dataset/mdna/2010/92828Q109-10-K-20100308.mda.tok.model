this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties

actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly under the caption risk factors 
overview organization virtus commenced operations on november  through a reverse merger with duff phelps corporation 
from to  we were a majority owned indirect subsidiary of pnx 
on january   a subsidiary of pnx acquired the outstanding shares of the company not already owned and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of pnx 
on october   after the sale of convertible preferred stock to harris bankcorp  a subsidiary of the bank of montreal  we became an indirect  majority owned subsidiary of pnx 
on december   pnx distributed of virtus common stock to pnx stockholders in a spin off transaction  excluding the net assets and business of the company s subsidiary  goodwin  which had historically been a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
following the spin off  pnx has no ownership interest in the company and harris bankcorp owns of the company s outstanding shares of series b convertible preferred stock 
as a new standalone public company after the spin off  we have completed the rebranding of our company as virtus  relocated our corporate offices to a new facility  hired employees and service providers necessary to replace those services that had historically been provided by pnx and obtained standalone insurance  legal  audit and other services 
our business we are a provider of investment management products and services to individuals and institutions 
we operate a multi manager investment management business  comprised of affiliated managers  each having its own distinct investment style  autonomous investment process and brand 
we believe our customers value this approach  especially institutional customers who appreciate individual managers with distinctive cultures and styles 
investors have an array of needs driven by factors such as market conditions  risk tolerance and investment goals 
a key element of our business is offering a variety of investment styles and multiple disciplines to meet those needs 
to that end  for our mutual funds  we supplement the investment capabilities of our affiliated managers with those of select unaffiliated sub advisors 
we do that by partnering with unaffiliated sub advisors whose strategies we believe appeal to investors and are not typically available to retail mutual fund customers 
we provide our products in a number of forms and through multiple distribution channels 
our retail products include open end mutual funds  closed end funds and separately managed accounts 
our fund family of open end funds is distributed primarily through intermediaries 
our closed end funds trade on the new york stock exchange 
retail separately managed accounts are comprised of intermediary programs  sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms  and private client accounts  which are offerings to the high net worth clients of our affiliated managers 
we also manage institutional accounts for corporations  multi employer retirement funds and foundations  endowments and special purpose funds 
our earnings are primarily driven by asset based investment management fees charged on these various products 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are calculated using daily or weekly average assets or assets at the end of the preceding quarter 

table of contents our profitability drivers our profitability is primarily driven by the following factors investment management fees earned on assets under management 
depending on the product  these fees can be based on average daily or weekly market values  ending market values of the preceding quarter  or outstanding principal values of the assets being managed 
assets under management are principally driven by the following factors sales less redemptions net flows  and absolute and relative investment performance 
operating expenses  including base compensation  variable incentive compensation  distribution expenses  and administrative expenses 
amortization and impairment of intangibles  principally related to acquired investment contracts 
market developments financial markets have experienced unprecedented credit and liquidity issues over the past two years  resulting in significant volatility and declines in the equity and fixed income markets during this period 
markets have rebounded considerably since the lows reached in the first quarter of  however  they continue to be at levels substantially lower than experienced prior to the deterioration of economic conditions 
credit markets have suffered significantly  with many lenders and institutional investors reducing  and in some cases  ceasing to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
additionally  concerns over increasing unemployment  fluctuating inflation and energy costs have contributed to diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward 
these factors  combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated a prolonged economic slowdown over the past two years 
as a result  there has been a severe impact on the global financial markets and economies 
this economic environment has had a direct impact on the investing activities of both retail and institutional investors 
the declines and volatility in the equity and fixed income markets over the past two years have reduced the value of our assets under management which has resulted in lower fee revenues 
the continuing turmoil in the equity and debt markets impacts investor confidence  resulting in investors favoring significantly lower investment risk 
the adverse conditions of the markets and the economic environment  which could continue throughout and beyond  have and may continue to have a negative impact on our assets under management and our revenues 
changes in our assets under management are driven in great part by the performance of the equity markets 
while markets generally experienced positive performance in  with the s p index up approximately during the year  the markets also experienced significant volatility during this period with the s p index down as much as for the year on march  we expect that market volatility could continue in the short term 
as markets continue to experience volatility  we may experience decreased investment inflows and increased redemptions of certain products as a result of these market conditions

table of contents employment expenses year ended december  compared to year ended december  employment expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the exclusion of goodwin after the spin off accounted for million of the decrease 
the remaining decrease is due primarily to reductions in variable compensation  such as commissions and incentive compensation  of million 
also contributing to the decrease were reductions in salaries  benefits  and payroll taxes mainly as a result of lower staffing levels for the year ended december   reflecting the full year impact of significant reductions in staff that occurred in year ended december  compared to year ended december  employment expenses of million in decreased million compared to the prior year 
the decrease is due primarily to reductions in variable compensation of million 
the remaining decrease is attributable to the impact of actions taken to streamline operations  resulting in reduced headcount during the year ended december  distribution and administrative expenses year ended december  compared to year ended december  distribution and administrative expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to million in decreased asset based expenses paid to our distribution partners including trail commissions and other distribution costs

other operating expenses attributable to goodwin  which is no longer a part of the company effective as of the spin off were million for the year ended december  these expenses were not incurred for the year ended december  for the year ended december   certain services  totaling million were provided to us by our former parent 
we have eliminated or replaced these services  at a lower cost  by hiring additional staff to perform the same services or contracting with external providers 
the savings have been partially offset by new expenses related to our being a standalone publicly traded company 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  other operating expenses were million in  an increase of million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
these expenses consist primarily of computer services  professional fees  investment research fees  travel  training  portfolio management operational costs  rent  insurance  printing and general taxes  depreciation and other office and corporate expenses 
the services provided by pnx during this period are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses increased primarily as a result of a million increase in professional fees and a million increase in rent expense resulting from vacating and or moving office space at three of our affiliates partially offset by a decrease in charges from pnx 
the current period also included million of costs associated with certain client portfolio losses 

table of contents restructuring and severance in  we incurred severance costs of million resulting from staff reductions as we continued to execute on cost reduction efforts and further streamlining of our operations 
in  we incurred severance costs of million resulting from staff reductions related to the outsourcing of certain of our transfer agent functions and other reductions as we continued to streamline our operations 
we also vacated office space at two of our affiliates resulting in charges of million 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment there were no goodwill or intangible asset impairments for the year ended december  as the estimated fair value of goodwill and intangible assets was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
in  we recorded pre tax non cash impairment charges of million related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we determined that several triggering events had occurred during the year as a result of the changes in the market environment  specifically the equity market declines  a marked decrease in credit market liquidity and unprecedented government intervention in the financial markets 
based on the results on our impairment assessment  we recorded million of goodwill and million of intangible asset impairments 
the primary drivers of the impairment were the reduction in assets under management due to markets and valuation multiples for asset managers being at multi year lows 
intangible asset amortization year ended december  compared to year ended december  amortization expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year as a result of the lower remaining carrying value of our intangible assets after the impairment charges incurred in year ended december  compared to year ended december  amortization decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year as a result of the lower remaining carrying value of the assets after reflecting impairments throughout the year 
other income and expenses other income expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income expense increased million to income of million for the year ended december  from an expense of million for the year ended december  due primarily to increases in the market value of trading securities in as compared to consistent with the performance of overall markets  significant losses were experienced in the fourth quarter of and gains were experienced in the second and third quarters of  resulting in the large swing from a loss in to a gain in year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income expense decreased million to an expense of million for the year ended december  from an expense of million for the year ended december  due primarily to decreases in the market value of trading securities in as compared to consistent with the performance of overall markets  significant losses were experienced in the fourth quarter of  resulting in the large loss for the year ended december  interest expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  interest expense is attributable primarily to our long term debt and is reported net of interest and dividend income earned on cash equivalents and investments 
interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the 
table of contents prior year 
the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to a lower average outstanding debt balance in the effective interest rate of the new credit facility entered into in september  inclusive of the amortization of deferred financing costs  was as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  interest expense was mainly comprised of interest expense on the intercompany debt with our former parent company  but also includes interest and dividend income earned 
on december   million of debt obligations to our former parent company was extinguished through loan forgiveness 
this  and to a lesser degree the million of quarterly debt repayments on the remaining intercompany debt  resulted in a decrease in interest expense of million in as compared to interest and dividend income decreased by million due to lower interest rates and dividend yields on our cash holdings during income tax expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  our income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  although the company generated a pre tax loss for the year ended december   tax expenses were recorded in certain state jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our income tax benefit increased from million in to million in due to the net loss generated in partially offset by a million increase in our valuation allowance 
upon completion of the spin off on december   in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the company believed  based on the weight of available evidence  that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized because certain potential tax planning strategies available to our former parent company will no longer be available to the company 
effects of inflation for the years ended december   and  inflation did not have a material effect on our consolidated revenues or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources certain financial data the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of december  in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents marketable securities current portion of long term debt long term notes payable and other debt convertible preferred securities working capital years ended december  cash flow data provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
at december   our working capital was million 
in the third and fourth quarter of we generated positive cash flow from operations and during the year ended december  we reduced our outstanding indebtedness by million 
we believe that our available cash  marketable securities and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our expected normal cash operating requirements and other capital requirements in the short term  which we consider to be the next twelve months 
our ability to meet our future cash needs  including repayment of our credit facility  interest payments on our credit facility  payment of preferred stock dividends and other operating requirements  will depend upon our future operating performance  the level and mix of assets under management and general economic conditions  some of which are beyond our control 
additional matters outside of our control that could impact our liquidity include any further deterioration in or continued volatility of the global economy and capital markets and unexpected cash  debt or operating requirements 
capital requirements our short term capital requirements  which we consider to be those capital requirements due within one year  include payment of interest on our credit facility  payment of annual incentive compensation and payment of preferred stock dividends 
incentive compensation  which is generally the company s largest annual operating cash payment  is paid in the first quarter of the year 
short term capital requirements may also include million of quarterly dividends on our million outstanding shares of series b convertible preferred stock 
the dividend can be paid in cash or  at the election of the board of directors and subject to authorization of the issuance of additional preferred shares by the holders of series b convertible preferred stock  in additional convertible preferred shares 
the dividend is cumulative and will continue to accumulate whether or not declared and paid 
during the year ended december   the company paid million of preferred stock dividends related to the quarters ended december   march   june  and september  on march   the board of directors of the company declared cash dividends on its series b convertible preferred stock for the three month periods ended december  of million which the company expects to pay in march of long term capital requirements could include seed money for new products  principal payments on our outstanding credit facility principal balance  infrastructure improvements and  possibly  strategic acquisitions 
the financial markets have experienced a period of significant volatility over the past two years  which has impacted investment outflows and the value of our assets under management and resulted in lower fee revenues 
markets could further decline and there could be significant volatility 
should assets under management decline for any reason  revenues  net income and cash flow could continue to be negatively impacted 
reductions in related variable expenses  primarily incentive compensation and distribution costs  would marginally compensate for this loss of revenue but the company could experience a material reduction in income from operations 
capital and reserve requirements our subsidiary  vpd  is a broker dealer registered with the sec and is therefore subject to certain rules regarding minimum net capital  as defined by those rules 
the subsidiary is required to maintain a ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital  as defined  which may not exceed to and must also maintain a minimum amount of net capital 
failure to meet these requirements could result in adverse consequences to us including additional reporting requirements  tighter ratios and business interruption 
at december  and  the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital of the broker dealer was below the maximum allowed and our net capital was significantly in excess of that required 
balance sheet cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid affiliated money market mutual fund investments 
cash and cash equivalents typically increase in the second  third and fourth quarters of the year as 
table of contents we record  but do not pay  variable incentive compensation 
historically  annual incentives are paid in the first quarter of the year 
marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments in our affiliated mutual funds 
we provide capital for funds and strategies in their early stages of development 
our long term debt decreased by million during the year ended december  as we made our scheduled quarterly note payable repayments of million and prepaid million in conjunction with the retirement of our previously outstanding note payable on september  the increase in furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements and other long term liabilities as of december  as compared to december  is due to gross presentation of leasehold improvements totaling million on two of our locations that were funded by lessors with no cash impact to the company 
see accounting policy description in note to our consolidated financial statements for further details

net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  decreased by million from the prior year primarily due to the decrease in our operating results due to the significant market declines in  the impact of which was partially offset by decreases in variable costs 
although our operating expenses have also declined with revenue  certain of our overhead and other costs are not variable in the short term and take a longer period of time to reduce relative to the decrease in revenues  resulting in less cash flow being generated

table of contents impact of new accounting standards for a discussion of accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the use of estimates 
actual results will vary from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
goodwill as of december   the carrying amount of goodwill was million 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of identified net assets and liabilities acquired 
for goodwill  impairment tests for the company are performed annually  or more frequently  should circumstances change which would indicate the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount 
we have determined that the company has only one reporting unit 
for our annual impairment test performed as of october   we estimated fair value based on consideration of several valuation techniques  which included i market based multiple model  ii discounted cash flow model and iii market capitalization 
for the year ended december   there were no goodwill impairments as the estimated fair value of goodwill was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
consistent with the overall market conditions in  with the s p up approximately for the year ended december   there were significant improvements in key valuation assumptions used in management s valuation as compared to the prior year 
key assumptions included in our valuation included a discount rate of  a long term growth rate of and operating margins of and an average revenue multiple of x revenues 
a change in the key assumptions used would not have resulted in an impairment charge 
for the year ended december   we recorded total goodwill impairments of million as a result of the changes in the market environment  specifically the equity market declines and a marked decrease in credit market liquidity 
to determine the reporting unit fair value at annual and interim testing dates  management used a composite valuation derived from the methodologies described below 
market based multiple model the significant assumptions used in assessing the implied valuation include the average trading multiples of peer asset management companies based on revenues 
the average revenue multiple used was x revenues 
a decrease in the revenue multiple used would have increased the impairment charge by million 
discounted cash flow model the significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include projected revenue growth rates  operating margins and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows 
projected revenues are assumed to have a long term growth rate  operating margins are estimated at approximately and projected net cash flows are discounted at to determine the present value 
the discount rate is based on an estimated cost of capital that reflects the current economic conditions 
a decrease to in the growth rate applied to gross revenues would have increased the impairment charge by million  a decrease of basis points in the operating margin assumption would have increased the impairment by million and an increase in the discount rate to would have increased the impairment charge by million 
in addition to the market based multiple model and discounted cash flow model  to a lesser extent  we also considered market capitalization of our company based on initial trading of our common stock in the first week of january  as no trading occurred prior to that date  as well as the implied valuation from the preferred equity investment in our company in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents in weighting the valuation methods described above  we applied a weighting of for each of the market based multiple model and the discounted cash flow model 
more weight was given to these methods as management believed they provided the most consistent and reliable means from which to measure fair value during times of significant volatility 
the company weighted the market capitalization method at since the company had no history trading as a public company and volatility in markets may not have provided the most accurate depiction of fair value 
the company weighted the implied valuation from preferred stock at since the instrument contained features that resemble both debt and equity and  therefore  provided a less reliable depiction of pure equity value 
had the company weighted these four techniques evenly  the impairment charge would have increased by million 
significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
indefinite lived intangible assets as of december   the carrying values of indefinite lived intangible assets were million 
indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts with affiliated closed end registered investment companies 
indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed annually  or more frequently should circumstances change which would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
the company estimated fair value of intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis 
management believes a discounted cash flow analysis is most appropriate in valuing the indefinite lived intangible assets because it has concluded that it is a likely method that would be utilized by market participants 
the key variables impacting the valuation of the intangible assets under this model include the discount rate and assets under management related to the relevant investment advisory contracts 
for the year ended december   there were no indefinite lived intangible asset impairments as the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
consistent with the overall market conditions in  with the s p up approximately for the year ended december   there were significant improvements in key valuation assumptions used in management s valuation as compared to the prior year 
for our annual impairment test performed as of october   the discount rate applied in the calculation used by the company was  based on an estimated cost of capital that reflects the current economic conditions 
a increase in the discount rate to would not result in an impairment charge 
a decrease in assets under management underlying these investment advisory contracts would not result in an impairment charge 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a million impairment charge as a result of the changes in the market environment  specifically the equity market declines  a marked decrease in credit market liquidity and unprecedented government intervention in the financial markets 
for our annual impairment test performed as of october   the discount rate applied in the calculation used by the company was  based on an estimated cost of capital that reflected the then current economic conditions 
a increase in the discount rate to would result in additional impairment of million 
a decrease in assets under management underlying these investment advisory contracts would result in additional impairment of million 
significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
definite lived intangible assets as of december   the carrying values of definite lived intangible assets were million 
definite lived intangible assets are comprised of acquired investment advisory contracts 
the company monitors 
table of contents the useful lives of definite lived intangible assets and revises the useful lives  if necessary  based on the circumstances 
significant judgment is required in estimating the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on our amortization expense 
all amortization expense has been  and continues to be  calculated on a straight line basis 
for definite lived intangible assets  impairment testing is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the company determines the carrying value of the definite lived intangible assets is less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset we will quantify the impairment using a discounted cash flow model 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model include estimated remaining useful life of the intangible asset  discount rate  investment management fee rates on assets under management  and market expense ratio factor 
during the year ended december   no events or circumstances occurred that indicated the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets might be impaired and therefore no impairment tests were performed during this period 
during the year ended december   the company recorded definite lived intangible assets impairment charges totaling million 
an interim test was triggered by management s assessment that declines in assets and revenue supporting the advisory contracts coupled with a notice of termination from one large account required such a test 
other impairment tests were performed as the result of management s assessment that the carrying amount of the definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable as a result of changes in the market environment  primarily driven by equity market declines 
other contributors to the assessment were a marked decrease in credit market liquidity and unprecedented government intervention in the financial markets 
of the key assumptions considered  both the remaining useful lives and the discount rate are significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow model 
a one year decrease in the remaining useful life of definite lived intangible assets would have resulted in an additional million of intangible asset impairments and a increase from the discount rate that was used in the model to a discount rate would have increased the impairment charge by million 
in  the company had billion of institutional account redemptions 
of that amount  billion was from one affiliated manager  of which billion was from a single account relationship 
the company believes that the useful life for the remaining million of institutional definite lived intangible assets is approximately nine years given the characteristics of the remaining assets under management 
these characteristics include both long standing relationships with remaining clients and product performance of remaining assets under management 
management estimates remaining useful lives using its historical experience and long term operating trends 
this results in a range of years  depending on the product 
significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
revenue recognition investment management fees are recorded as income during the period in which services are performed 
investment management fees  which are accrued monthly  are earned based upon a percentage of assets under 
table of contents management  and are paid pursuant to the terms of the respective investment management contracts  which generally require monthly or quarterly payment 
management fees for structured finance products  such as clos and cdos  that accrue as services are rendered but are subordinate to other interests and payable only if certain financial criteria of the underlying collateral are met  are recorded as income when the structured finance products are in compliance with required financial criteria and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for investment management fees in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  and has recorded its management fees net of fees paid to unaffiliated advisors 
amounts paid to unaffiliated sub advisors for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
investment management fees are calculated based on our assets under management 
we rely on data provided to us by mutual funds and custodians in the pricing of assets under management  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
the boards of our mutual funds and management of custodians of the assets we manage have formal pricing policies and procedures over pricing of investments 
given our reliance on the data provided to us by the mutual funds and the custodians in the pricing of the assets under management  management has established internal procedures to corroborate that mutual fund and custodial pricing appears adequate and has implemented processes to ensure valuation discrepancies are investigated and resolved 
distribution and service fees are earned based on a percentage of assets under management and are paid monthly pursuant to the terms of the respective distribution and service fee contracts 
administration and transfer agent fees consist of fund administration fees  transfer agent fees  fiduciary fees and underwriter fees 
fund administration fees are earned based on the average daily assets in the funds 
transfer agent fees are earned based on a contractual amount plus a fee based on the number of accounts at the end of a month 
fiduciary fees are recorded monthly based on the number of k accounts 
underwriter fees are sales based charges on sales of certain class a share mutual funds 
the company outsources certain back office functions related to administration and transfer agent fees 
administration fees are reported on a gross basis and transfer agent fees are reported on a net basis in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
transfer agent fees  which are reported net of payments to third party service providers  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we concluded that a valuation allowance on substantially all of the company s deferred tax assets at december  is required 
our methodology for determining the realizability of deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from our operations and consideration of available tax planning strategies and actions that would be implemented by us  if necessary  as well as the expiration dates and amounts of carry forwards related to net operating losses and capital losses 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with demonstrated operating results 
the projection also includes consideration of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities that are in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
prior to december   the company was included in the consolidated federal income tax return filed by pnx and was a party to a tax sharing agreement by and among pnx and its subsidiaries 
in accordance with this agreement  federal income taxes for the years ended december  and were allocated as if they had been calculated on a separate company basis  except that benefits for any net operating loss were provided to the extent such loss was utilized in the consolidated federal tax return 
deferred tax assets and or liabilities were 
table of contents determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax reporting basis for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences were recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates was recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
the tax separation agreement the agreement between virtus and pnx as of december   as amended on april   required pnx to make certain elections and waivers 
the agreement provided for a waiver of tax basis by pnx in an amount that was necessary to preserve i the deferred tax assets of deferred tax assets reported as of december   which under generally accepted accounting principles  represents temporary differences and is recorded in the financial statements and ii tax basis in stock of subsidiary entities which  under generally accepted accounting principles  is not recorded in the financial statements 
in september  our former parent company filed its consolidated federal income tax return  which included virtus as a majority owned subsidiary 
in its federal income tax filing  pnx provided a waiver of tax basis sufficient to preserve the company s tax basis in intangible assets 
the waiver and elections made by pnx and included in their tax return were contemplated and reflected in the company s deferred tax assets reported as of december  based on our review of the information filed in the tax return  there were no significant changes in previously reported deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance have been adjusted  as necessary with no net impact to the company s income tax expense  to reflect changes in estimates that were identified based on the return filed by our former parent company 
uncertain tax positions taken by the company are accounted for under asc  income taxes  which may require certain benefits taken on a tax return to not be recognized in the financial statements when there is the potential for certain tax positions to be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
loss contingencies the likelihood that a loss contingency exists is evaluated using the criteria of asc  loss contingencies  and is recorded if the likelihood of a loss is considered both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our reasonable estimate of the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisor for the funds and accounts we manage as investment advisor 
most of our revenue for the three years ended december  was derived from investment management  distribution and fund administration fees  which are typically based on the market value of assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the market value of our investments  consisting primarily of marketable securities 
at december   the fair value of marketable securities was million 
assuming a increase or decrease in the fair value of marketable securities at december   our net loss would change by million and our total comprehensive loss would change by million for the year ended december  interest rate risk in connection with the company s entry into the credit facility  on september  the company repaid the previously outstanding note payable  which had a fixed interest rate of per annum 
at december   the company has million outstanding under the credit facility that has a variable interest rate 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at the company s option  either libor for interest periods of   or months or an alternate base rate  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
at december   the interest rate in effect for the credit facility was 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates for the year ended december  assuming our credit facility was in place on january  would have changed our interest expense by approximately million
