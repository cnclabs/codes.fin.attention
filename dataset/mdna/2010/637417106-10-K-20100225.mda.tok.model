item a 
risk factors carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
if any of the events or developments described below were actually to occur  nnn s business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
current financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on nnn  its tenants  and commercial real estate in general 
current financial and economic conditions continue to be challenging and the continuation or worsening of such conditions  including any disruption in the capital markets  could adversely affect nnn s business and results of operations and the financial condition of nnn s tenants  developers  borrowers  lenders or the institutions that hold nnn s cash balances and short term investments  which may expose nnn to increased risks of default by these parties 
there can be no assurance that actions of the united states government  federal reserve or other government and regulatory bodies intended to stabilize the economy or financial markets will achieve their intended effect 
additionally  some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions  capital providers  retailers  consumers or nnn s financial condition  results of operations or the trading price of nnn s shares 
potential consequences of the current financial and economic conditions include the financial condition of nnn s tenants  which operate in the retail industry may be adversely affected  which may result in tenant defaults under the leases due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failures or for other reasons  the ability to borrow on terms and conditions that nnn finds acceptable  or at all  may be limited  which could reduce nnn s ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt  reduce nnn s returns from acquisition and development activities and increase nnn s future interest expense  reduced values of nnn s properties may limit nnn s ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices and may reduce the availability of buyer financing  the value and liquidity of nnn s short term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold nnn s cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which nnn has made short term investments  the dislocation of the markets for nnn s short term investments  increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors  and one or more lenders under the credit facility could fail and nnn may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms  or at all 
nnn may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms  if at all 
nnn may be unable to obtain capital on favorable terms  if at all  to further its business objectives or meet its existing obligations 
debt and equity capital availability in the real estate market is severely strained 
nearly all of nnn s debt  including the credit facility  is subject to balloon principal payments due at maturity 
these maturities range between and the ability of nnn to make these scheduled 
table of contents principal payments may be adversely impacted by nnn s inability to extend or refinance the credit facility  the inability to dispose of assets at an attractive price or the inability to obtain additional debt or equity capital 
capital that may be available may be materially more expensive or available under terms that are materially more restrictive than nnn s existing capital which would have an adverse impact on nnn s business  financial condition or results of operations 
loss of revenues from tenants would reduce nnn s cash flow 
nnn s five largest tenants accounted for an aggregate of approximately percent of nnn s annual base rent as of december  the default  financial distress  bankruptcy or liquidation of one or more of nnn s tenants could cause substantial vacancies among nnn s investment portfolio 
vacancies reduce nnn s revenues  increase property expenses and could decrease the ultimate sale value of each such vacant property 
upon the expiration of the leases that are currently in place  the tenant may choose not to renew the lease or  nnn may not be able to re lease the vacant property at a comparable lease rate or without incurring additional expenditures in connection with such renewal or re leasing 
a significant portion of the source of nnn s investment portfolio annual base rent is heavily concentrated in specific industry classifications  tenants and in specific geographic locations 
as of december   approximately  percent of nnn s investment portfolio annual base rent is generated from five retail lines of trade  including convenience stores percent and full service restaurants percent  percent of nnn s investment portfolio annual base rent is generated from five tenants  including pantry percent and susser percent  percent of nnn s investment portfolio annual base rent is generated from five states  including texas percent and florida percent 
any financial hardship and or changes in these lines of trade  tenants or states could have an adverse effect on nnn s results of operations 
owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate carries inherent risks 
nnn s economic performance and the value of its real estate assets are subject to the risk that if nnn s properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet its operating expenses  including debt service  nnn s cash flow and ability to pay distributions to its shareholders will be adversely affected 
as a real estate company  nnn is susceptible to the following real estate industry risks  which are beyond its control changes in national  regional and local economic conditions and outlook  decreases in consumer spending and retail sales  economic downturns in the areas where nnn s properties are located  adverse changes in local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply  reduction in demand or intense competition for tenants  changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of nnn s properties to tenants  zoning  regulatory restrictions  or change in taxes  and changes in interest rates or availability of financing 
all of these factors could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates  which could adversely affect nnn s results of operations 

table of contents nnn s real estate investments are illiquid 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  nnn s ability to adjust the portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited 
certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions  including i debt service if any  ii real estate taxes  and iii operating and maintenance costs 
this combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result  under certain market conditions  in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on nnn s financial condition 
nnn may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities 
subject to a determination of the level of risk and potential cost of remediation  nnn may acquire a property where some level of contamination may exist 
investments in real property create a potential for substantial environmental liability on the part of the owner of such property from the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property or the improper disposal of hazardous substances emanating from the property  regardless of fault 
as a part of its acquisition due diligence process  nnn generally obtains an environmental site assessment for each property 
in such cases where nnn intends to acquire real estate where some level of contamination may exist  nnn generally requires the seller or tenant to i remediate the problem  ii indemnify nnn for environmental liabilities  and or iii agree to other arrangements deemed appropriate by nnn  including  under certain circumstances  the purchase of environmental insurance to address environmental conditions at the property 
as of february   nnn has investment properties currently under some level of environmental remediation 
in general  the seller  the tenant or an adjacent land owner is responsible for the cost of the environmental remediation for each of these investment properties 
in the event of a bankruptcy or other inability on the part of these parties to cover these costs  nnn may have to cover the costs of remediation  fines or other environmental liabilities at these and other properties and may have liability to third parties 
nnn may also own properties where required remediation has not begun or adverse environmental conditions have not yet been detected 
this may require remediation or otherwise subject nnn to liability including liability to third parties 
nnn cannot assure that i it will not be required to undertake or pay for removal or remediation of any contamination of the properties currently or previously owned by nnn  ii nnn will not be subject to fines by governmental authorities or litigation  iii nnn will not be subject to litigation by and liability to third parties  or iv the costs of such removal  remediation fines  third party liability  or litigation would not be material 
nnn may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies 
nnn cannot assure that it will be able to implement its investment strategies successfully 
additionally  nnn cannot assure that its property portfolio will expand at all  or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size 
in addition  investment in additional real estate assets is subject to a number of risks 
because nnn expects to invest in markets other than the ones in which its current properties are located or properties which may be leased to tenants other than those to which nnn has historically leased properties  nnn will also be subject to the risks associated with investment in new markets or with new tenants that may be relatively unfamiliar to nnn s management team 
nnn s development activities are subject to  without limitation  risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals  the cost and timely completion of construction including risks from factors beyond nnn s control  such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages  the risk of finding tenants for the properties and the ability to obtain both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms 
these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and  under certain circumstances  could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken or provide a tenant the opportunity to terminate a lease 
any of these situations may delay or eliminate proceeds or cash flows nnn expects from these projects  which could have an adverse effect on nnn s financial condition 

table of contents nnn may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy 
nnn may be unable to sell properties targeted for disposition including its inventory properties due to adverse market conditions 
this may adversely affect  among other things  nnn s ability to sell under favorable terms  execute its operating strategy  achieve target earnings or returns  retire or repay debt or pay dividends 
a change in the assumptions used to determine the value of commercial mortgage residual interests could adversely affect nnn s financial position 
as of december   the residuals had a carrying value of  the value of these residuals is based on assumptions made by nnn to determine their value 
these assumptions include discount rate  loan loss  prepayment speed and interest rate assumptions made by nnn to determine their value 
if actual experience differs materially from these assumptions  the actual future cash flow could be less than expected and the value of the residuals  as well as nnn s earnings  could decline 
nnn may suffer a loss in the event of a default or bankruptcy of a borrower 
if a borrower defaults on a mortgage  structured finance loan or other loan made by nnn  and does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the loan  nnn may suffer a loss of principal and interest 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower  nnn may not be able to recover against all or any of the assets of the borrower  or the assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy the balance due on the loan 
in addition  certain of nnn s loans may be subordinate to other debt of a borrower 
these investments are typically loans secured by a borrower s pledge of its ownership interests in the entity that owns the real estate or other assets 
these agreements are typically subordinated to senior loans secured by other loans encumbering the underlying real estate or assets 
subordinated positions are generally subject to a higher risk of nonpayment of principal and interest than the more senior loans 
as of december   mortgages and notes receivables had an outstanding principal balance of  if a borrower defaults on the debt senior to nnn s loan  or in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower  nnn s loan will be satisfied only after the borrower s senior creditors claims are satisfied 
where debt senior to nnn s loans exists  the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit nnn s ability to amend loan documents  assign the loans  accept prepayments  exercise remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 
bankruptcy proceedings and litigation can significantly increase the time needed for nnn to acquire underlying collateral  if any  in the event of a default  during which time the collateral may decline in value 
in addition  there are significant costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process 
certain provisions of nnn s leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable 
nnn s rights and obligations with respect to its leases  structured finance loans  mortgage loans or other loans are governed by written agreements 
a court could determine that one or more provisions of such an agreement are unenforceable  such as a particular remedy  a loan prepayment provision or a provision governing nnn s security interest in the underlying collateral of a borrower or lessee 
nnn could be adversely impacted if this were to happen with respect to an asset or group of assets 
property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit nnn s control of those investments 
joint ventures or partnerships involve risks not otherwise present for direct investments by nnn 
it is possible that nnn s co venturers or partners may have different interests or goals than nnn at any time and they may take actions contrary to nnn s requests  policies or objectives  including nnn s policy with respect to maintaining its qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture or partnership investments include impasses on decisions because in some instances no single co venturer or partner has full control over the joint venture or partnership  respectively  or the co venturer or partner may become 
table of contents insolvent  bankrupt or otherwise unable to contribute to the joint venture or partnership  respectively 
further  disputes may develop with a co venturer or partner over decisions affecting the property  joint venture or partnership that may result in litigation  arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution 
competition with numerous other reits  commercial developers  real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede nnn s ability to grow 
nnn may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to complete suitable property acquisitions or developments on advantageous terms due to competition for such properties with others engaged in real estate investment activities 
nnn s inability to successfully acquire or develop new properties may affect nnn s ability to achieve anticipated return on investment or realize its investment strategy  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
operating losses from retail operations on investment properties may adversely impact nnn s results of operations 
in june  nnn acquired the operations of the auto service business which was operated on investment properties 
a third party manages and staffs these operations on behalf of nnn 
the results of business operations from these properties are subject to the typical execution risks inherent with many retail operations including merchandising  pricing  customer service  competition  consumer preferences and behavior  safety  compliance with various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  environmental contamination  unfavorable weather conditions  or other trends in the markets they serve 
these factors could negatively impact nnn s results of operations from these investment properties 
uninsured losses may adversely affect nnn s ability to pay outstanding indebtedness 
nnn s properties are generally covered by comprehensive liability  fire  flood  and extended insurance coverage 
nnn believes that the insurance carried on its properties is adequate in accordance with industry standards 
there are  however  types of losses such as from hurricanes  wars or earthquakes which may be uninsurable  or the cost of insuring against these losses may not be economically justifiable 
if an uninsured loss occurs or a loss exceeds policy limits  nnn could lose both its invested capital and anticipated revenues from the property  thereby reducing nnn s cash flow 
acts of violence  terrorist attacks or war may affect the markets in which nnn operates and nnn s results of operations 
terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may negatively affect nnn s operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be terrorist attacks against businesses within the united states 
these attacks may directly impact nnn s physical facilities or the businesses or the financial condition of its tenants  developers  borrowers  lenders or financial institutions with which nnn has a relationship 
the united states is engaged in armed conflict  which could have an impact on these parties 
the consequences of armed conflict are unpredictable  and nnn may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business 
more generally  any of these events or threats of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economies 
they also could result in  or cause a deepening of  economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on nnn s financial condition or results of operations 
vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect nnn s business or financial condition 
as of december   nnn owned vacant  un leased investment properties  including two vacant land parcels  which accounted for approximately four percent of total investment properties 
nnn is actively marketing these properties for sale or lease but may not be able to sell or lease these properties on 
table of contents favorable terms or at all 
the lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from the rejection by any bankrupt tenant of any of their respective leases with nnn could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations of nnn if nnn is unable to re lease the investment properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner 
as of december   approximately one percent of the total gross leasable area of nnn s investment portfolio was leased to two tenants that have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and have the right to reject or affirm their lease with nnn 
nnn anticipates the number of vacancies and bankrupt tenants will increase 
the amount of debt nnn has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect nnn s business and financial condition 
as of december   nnn had total mortgage debt outstanding of approximately  total unsecured notes payable of  and no balance outstanding on the credit facility 
nnn s organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that it may incur 
if nnn incurs additional indebtedness and permits a higher degree of leverage  debt service requirements would increase and could adversely affect nnn s financial condition and results of operations  as well as nnn s ability to pay principal and interest on the outstanding indebtedness or cash dividends to its stockholders 
in addition  increased leverage could increase the risk that nnn may default on its debt obligations 
the credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions to nnn s common and preferred stockholders 
the amount of debt outstanding at any time could have important consequences to nnn s stockholders 
for example  it could require nnn to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt  thereby reducing funds available for operations  real estate investments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future  increase nnn s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit nnn s ability to obtain any additional financing it may need in the future for working capital  debt refinancing  capital expenditures  real estate investments  development or other general corporate purposes  make it difficult to satisfy nnn s debt service requirements  limit nnn s ability to pay dividends in cash on its outstanding common and preferred stock  limit nnn s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the factors that affect the profitability of its business  and limit nnn s flexibility in conducting its business  which may place nnn at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms 
nnn s ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on its debt  or to retire or refinance such debt will depend primarily on its future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to the creditworthiness of its tenants  competition  and economic  financial  and other factors beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that nnn s business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt or meet its other cash needs 
if nnn is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from its business  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt  sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet its debt obligations and other cash needs 
nnn cannot assure stockholders that any such refinancing  sale of assets or additional financing would be possible or  if possible  on terms and conditions  including but not limited to the interest rate  which nnn would find acceptable or would not result in a material decline in earnings 

table of contents nnn is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt that could restrict its operating activities  and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under such debt 
nnn s unsecured debt contains various restrictive covenants which include  among others  provisions restricting nnn s ability to incur or guarantee additional debt  make certain distributions  investments and other restricted payments  including dividend payments on its outstanding common and preferred stock  limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to nnn  enter into transactions with certain affiliates  create certain liens  consolidate  merge or sell nnn s assets  and pre pay debt 
nnn s secured debt generally contains customary covenants  including  among others  provisions relating to the maintenance of the property securing the debt  restricting its ability to sell  assign or further encumber the properties securing the debt  restricting its ability to incur additional debt  restricting its ability to amend or modify existing leases  and relating to certain prepayment restrictions 
nnn s ability to meet some of its debt covenants  including covenants related to the condition of the property or payment of real estate taxes  may be dependent on the performance by nnn s tenants under their leases 
in addition  certain covenants in nnn s debt  including its credit facility  require nnn  among other things  to limit certain leverage ratios  maintain certain minimum interest and debt service coverage ratios  limit dividends declared and paid to nnn s common and preferred stockholders  and limit investments in certain types of assets 
nnn s failure to comply with certain of its debt covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under such debt and limit the dividends paid to nnn s common and preferred stockholders which would likely have a material adverse impact on nnn s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  these defaults could impair its access to the debt and equity markets 
costs of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect nnn s results of operations 
nnn cannot predict what other environmental laws or regulations will be enacted in the future  how future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted  or how future laws or regulations will affect nnn s properties 
compliance with new laws or regulations  or stricter interpretation of existing laws  
table of contents may require nnn  its retail tenants  or consumers to incur significant expenditures or impose significant environmental liability and could cause a material adverse effect on nnn s results of operation 
the market value of nnn s equity and debt securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 
as with other publicly traded securities  the market price of nnn s equity and debt securities depends on various factors  which may change from time to time and or may be unrelated to nnn s financial condition  operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices 
these factors  among others  include general economic and financial market conditions including the current global economic downturn  level and trend of interest rates  nnn s ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  changes in nnn s funds from operations or earnings estimates  changes in nnn s debt ratings or analyst ratings  nnn s financial condition and performance  market perception of nnn compared to other reits  and market perception of reits compared to other investment sectors 
nnn s failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability 
nnn intends to operate in a manner that will allow nnn to continue to qualify as a reit 
nnn believes it has been organized as  and its past and present operations qualify nnn as a reit 
however  the internal revenue service irs could successfully assert that nnn is not qualified as such 
in addition  nnn may not remain qualified as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within nnn s control 
furthermore  new tax legislation  administrative guidance or court decisions  in each instance potentially with retroactive effect  could make it more difficult or impossible for nnn to qualify as a reit or avoid significant tax liability 
if nnn fails to qualify as a reit  it would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing taxable income and would become subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
in this event  nnn could be subject to potentially significant tax liabilities and penalties 
unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  nnn would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost 
even if nnn remains qualified as a reit  nnn may face other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow 
even if nnn remains qualified for taxation as a reit  nnn may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes  such as mortgage recording taxes 
any of these taxes would decrease earnings and cash available 
table of contents for distribution to stockholders 
in addition  in order to meet the reit qualification requirements  nnn holds some of its assets through the trs 
adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce nnn s earnings  cash flow and market price of nnn s common stock 
at any time  the federal and state income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may change 
any such changes may have retroactive effect  and could adversely affect nnn or its stockholders 
for example  legislation enacted in and extended in generally reduced the federal income tax rate on most dividends paid by corporations to individual investors to a maximum of percent through 
reit dividends  with limited exceptions  will not benefit from the rate reduction  because a reit s income generally is not subject to corporate level tax 
as such  this legislation could cause shares in non reit corporations to be a more attractive investment to individual investors than shares in reits  and could have an adverse effect on the value of nnn s common stock 
compliance with reit requirements  including distribution requirements  may limit nnn s flexibility and negatively affect nnn s operating decisions 
to maintain its status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  nnn must meet certain requirements on an on going basis  including requirements regarding its sources of income  the nature and diversification of its assets  the amounts nnn distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of its shares 
nnn may also be required to make distributions to its stockholders when it does not have funds readily available for distribution or at times when nnn s funds are otherwise needed to fund capital expenditures or to fund debt service requirements 
nnn generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on amounts distributed to stockholders  providing it distributes percent of its reit taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a reit 
for each of the years in the three year period ended december   nnn believes it has qualified as a reit 
notwithstanding nnn s qualification for taxation as a reit  nnn is subject to certain state taxes on its income and real estate 
changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact nnn s reported financial performance 
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how nnn records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the commission  who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards  may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of nnn s financial statements 
these changes could have a material impact on nnn s reported financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  nnn could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in restating prior period financial statements 
nnn s failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and share price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
if nnn fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting  as such standards may be modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  nnn may not be able to ensure that it can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of moreover  effective internal control over financial reporting  particularly those related to revenue recognition  are necessary for nnn to produce reliable financial reports and to maintain its qualification as a reit and are important in helping to prevent financial fraud 
if nnn cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  its business and operating results could be harmed  reit qualification could be jeopardized  investors could lose confidence in the company s reported financial information  and the trading price of nnn s shares could drop significantly 

table of contents nnn s ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors 
nnn s ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described in this section were to occur

in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  nnn has classified the revenues related to i all investment properties that were sold and leasehold interest which expired  ii all inventory properties which generated revenues prior to disposition  and iii all investment and inventory properties which generated revenue and were held for sale at december   as discontinued operations 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed funds from operations ffo as a relative non gaap financial measure of performance of a reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
ffo is defined by nareit and is used by nnn as follows net earnings computed in accordance with gaap plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry  excluding gains or including losses on the disposition of investment assets and nnn s share of these items from nnn s unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of operating performance of real estate companies 
ffo does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of nnn s operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of operating performance of an equity reit because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the 
table of contents real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as an operating performance measure 
nnn s computation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo used by other equity reits  and therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
nnn has earnings from discontinued operations in each of its segments  investment assets and inventory assets 
all property dispositions from nnn s investment segment are classified as discontinued operations 
in addition  certain properties in nnn s inventory segment that have generated revenues before disposition are classified as discontinued operations 
these inventory properties have not historically been classified as discontinued operations  therefore  prior period comparable consolidated financial statements have been restated to include these properties in its earnings from discontinued operations 
these adjustments resulted in an increase in nnn s reported total revenues and total and per share earnings from continuing operations and a decrease in nnn s earnings from discontinued operations 
however  nnn s total and per share net earnings available to common stockholders is not affected

the term nnn or the company refers to national retail properties  inc and all of its consolidated subsidiaries 
nnn has elected to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries and their majority owned and controlled subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the trs 
overview nnn  a maryland corporation  is a fully integrated real estate investment trust reit formed in nnn s operations are divided into two primary business segments i investment assets  including real estate assets  mortgages and notes receivable including structured finance investments  and commercial mortgage residual interests collectively  investment assets  and ii inventory real estate assets inventory assets 
nnn acquires  owns  invests in  manages and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long term net leases and primarily held for investment investment properties or investment portfolio 
the inventory assets typically represent direct and indirect investment interests in real estate assets acquired or developed primarily for the purpose of selling the real estate inventory properties or inventory portfolio 
inventory assets typically consist of two types of properties  property for development development properties or development portfolio and improved properties exchange properties or exchange portfolio 
as of december   nnn owned  investment properties including properties with retail operations that nnn operates  with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately  square feet  located in states 
approximately percent of total properties in nnn s investment portfolio was leased or operated at december  in addition  as of december   nnn had  in mortgages and notes receivable including accrued interest receivable and structured finance investments and  of commercial mortgage residual interests 
as of december   nnn owned inventory properties  of which were development properties completed inventory and six land parcels and one was an exchange property 
nnn transferred properties from the inventory portfolio to the investment portfolio in december nnn s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of nnn 
the key indicators for nnn include items such as the composition of nnn s investment portfolio and structured finance investments such as tenant  geographic and line of trade diversification  the occupancy rate of nnn s investment portfolio  certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures  and industry trends and performance compared to that of nnn 
nnn continues to maintain its diversification by tenant  geography and line of trade 
nnn s highest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant including full and limited service sectors 
these sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace which nnn believes represents an area of attractive investment opportunity 
nnn also has some geographic concentration in the south and southeast which nnn believes are historically areas of above average population growth 
given these concentrations  any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic locations  respectively  could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of nnn 
during the years ended december   and  investment properties have remained at least percent leased 
the investment portfolio s average remaining lease term of years has remained 
table of contents fairly constant over the past three years which  coupled with its net lease structure  provides enhanced probability of maintaining occupancy and operating earnings 
the poor current economic environment has made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain debt and equity capital  which will likely reduce the pace of investments in new acquisitions or developments as well as the volume of dispositions 
additionally  the poor economic and retail environment will result in more retailers filing for bankruptcy and will make it more difficult to lease properties  which may have an adverse impact on nnn s occupancy 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of nnn s consolidated financial statements in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments on assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions  which in turn could have a material impact on nnn s financial statements 
a summary of nnn s accounting policies and procedures are included in note of nnn s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of nnn s consolidated financial statements 
real estate investment portfolio 
nnn records the acquisition of real estate at cost  including acquisition and closing costs 
the cost of properties developed by nnn includes direct and indirect costs of construction  property taxes  interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate subject to a lease 
in accordance with the fasb guidance on business combinations  the fair value of the real estate acquired with in place leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  value of in place leases  and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their relative fair values 
real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property  generally including property taxes  insurance  maintenance and repairs 
the leases are accounted for using either the operating or the direct financing method 
such methods are described below operating method leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate 
revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses including depreciation are charged to operations as incurred 
buildings are depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold interests are amortized on the straight line method over the terms of their respective leases 
when scheduled rental revenue varies during the lease term  income is recognized on a straight line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease 
accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight line basis 
direct financing method leases accounted for using the direct financing method are recorded at their net investment which at the inception of the lease generally represents the cost of the property 
unearned income is deferred and amortized into income over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on nnn s net investment in the leases 
real estate inventory portfolio 
the trs acquires and or develops and owns properties primarily for the purpose of selling the real estate 
the properties that are classified as held for sale at any given time may consist of properties that have been acquired in the marketplace with the intent to sell and properties 
table of contents that have been  or are currently being  constructed by the trs 
the trs records the acquisition of the real estate at cost  including the acquisition and closing costs 
the cost of the real estate developed by the trs also includes direct and indirect costs of construction  interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy 
real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value 
impairment real estate 
based upon the events or changes in certain circumstances  management periodically assesses its investment properties for possible impairment indicating that the carrying value of the asset  including accrued rental income  may not be recoverable through operations 
management determines whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  including the residual value of the real estate  with the carrying cost of the individual asset 
if an impairment is indicated  a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
commercial mortgage residual interest at fair value 
commercial mortgage residual interests  classified as available for sale  are reported at their market values with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the commercial mortgage residual interests were acquired in connection with the acquisition of percent equity interest of orange avenue mortgage investments  inc oami 
nnn recognizes the excess of all cash flows attributable to the commercial mortgage residual interests estimated at the acquisition transaction date over the initial investment the accretable yield as interest income over the life of the beneficial interest using the effective yield method 
losses are considered other than temporary valuation impairments if and when there has been a change in the timing or amount of estimated cash flows  exclusive of changes in interest rates  that leads to a loss in value 
revenue recognition 
rental revenues for non development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with the fasb guidance on accounting for leases  based on the terms of the lease at the time of acquisition of the leased asset 
rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant 
adoption of new accounting standards with change in accounting principles 
effective january   nnn adopted the new fasb guidance on accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
the new guidance requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
the debt component is to be recorded based upon the estimated fair value of non convertible debt with similar terms 
the resulting debt discount is amortized over the period during which the debt is outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
the new guidance has been applied retrospectively 
effective january   nnn adopted the new fasb guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities which also required retrospective application 
the adoption of the new guidance on convertible debt and share based payments resulted in non cash adjustments to the amounts and per share amounts 
use of estimates 
additional critical accounting policies of nnn include management s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
additional critical accounting policies include management s estimates of the useful lives used in calculating depreciation expense relating to real estate assets  the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including the commercial mortgage residual interests  the recoverability of the income tax benefit  the collectibility of receivables from tenants  including accrued rental income and capitalized overhead relating to development projects 
actual results could differ from those estimates

interest income on commercial mortgage residual interests 
interest income on commercial mortgage residual interests residuals decreased for the year ended december   as compared to december  but remained stable as a percent of total revenue from continuing operations

impact of inflation nnn s leases typically contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on nnn s results of operations 
tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases  increases in the consumer price index  and or increases in the tenant s sales volume 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 

table of contents the investment properties are leased to tenants under long term  net leases which typically require the tenant to pay certain operating expenses of a property  thus  nnn s exposure to inflation is reduced 
inflation may have an adverse impact on nnn s tenants 
liquidity general 
nnn s demand for funds has been and will continue to be primarily for i payment of operating expenses and cash dividends  ii property acquisitions and development  iii origination of mortgages and notes receivable including structured finance investments  iv capital expenditures  v payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness  and vi other investments
