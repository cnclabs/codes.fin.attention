we aim to strengthen our global partner program  with emphasis on developing strategic relations and achieving close integration with partners 
our partners continue to generate business in key areas such as archiving  records management and compliance 
outlook for fiscal we believe that we have a strong position in the ecm market and that the market for content solutions remains generally stable 
we think that our diversified geographic profile helps strengthen our position  in that approximately half of our revenues comes from outside of north america and thus helps cushions us from a downturn in any one specific region 
additionally  we believe that our focus on compliance based products also helps to partially insulate us from downturns in the macroeconomic environment 
we also believe we have a strong position in the ecm market because over of our revenues are from customer support revenues  which are generally a recurring source of income  and we expect this trend will continue 
we expect our revenue mix for fiscal to be in the following ranges of total revenue license to customer support to services and other to 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenue by product type and geography the following tables set forth our revenues by product  and as a percentage of total revenue as well as revenue by major geography and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the periods indicated revenue by product type in thousands change increase decrease license customer support services and other total of total revenue license customer support services and other total revenue by geography in thousands change increase decrease north america europe other total of total revenue north america europe other total license revenues consists of fees earned from the licensing of software products to customers 
our license revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions  the competitive strength of our software products  and our acquisitions 
license revenues increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in license revenue is geographically attributable to an increase in north america license sales of million and an increase in license sales in other geographies of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in europe of million 

table of contents overall our increase in license revenue is primarily due to the impact of our fiscal acquisitions and the result of a larger quantity of deals in excess of million achieved in fiscal compared to fiscal large deals achieved in fiscal compared to large deals achieved in fiscal 
customer support revenue consists of revenue from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenue is generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
therefore  changes in customer support revenue do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenue from period to period 
the terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months  with customer renewal options 
customer support revenues increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this was partially due to the impact of our fiscal acquisitions and growth of our north america operations 
the increase in customer support revenues was attributable to an increase in north america customer support sales of million  an increase in europe customer support sales of million and the remainder of the change due to sales generated in other geographies 
service and other revenues 
service revenue consists of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide implementation  training and integration services professional services 
other revenue consists of hardware revenue 
these revenues are grouped within the service and other category because they are relatively immaterial 
professional services  if purchased  are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses 
service and other revenues increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in service and other revenues is partially due to the impact of our fiscal acquisitions 
geographically  the increase is due to an increase in north america of million  partially offset by a decrease in revenues from europe of million 
the remainder of the difference was due to increased revenue generated in other geographies

overall gross margin on customer support revenue has remained relatively stable at approximately 
cost of service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration  customization and training with respect to our various software products 
the most significant components of these costs are personnel related expenses  travel costs and third party subcontracting 
cost of services and other revenues increased by million during fiscal  primarily as a result of higher training and support costs associated with an increase in service and other revenues 
of this increase approximately million  was the result of our hardware costs and sales commencing in the second quarter of fiscal overall gross margin on cost of services and other revenues has decreased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily on account of an increase in direct labour and labour related costs 
amortization of acquired technology based intangible assets increased by million due to the increase in intangible assets on account of acquisitions during fiscal operating expenses the following table sets forth total operating expenses by function and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands change increase decrease research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired customer based intangible assets special charges total in of total revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired customer based intangible assets special charges 
table of contents research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  contracted research and development expenses  and facility costs 
research and development enables organic growth and as such we dedicate extensive efforts to update and upgrade our product offering 
the primary driver is typically budgeted software upgrades and software development 
research and development expenses increased by million primarily due to an increase in direct labour and labour related benefits and expenses of million  partially offset by a reduction in consulting related expenses 
overall  our research and development expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  have remained relatively stable at roughly 
headcount at june  related to research and development activities  increased by employees compared to june  our expectation for fiscal is that research and development expenses will be in the range of of total revenue

depreciation expenses increased by million in fiscal  as a result of capital asset acquisitions made by us in fiscal 
table of contents amortization of acquired customer based intangible assets increased by million due to an increase in intangible assets resulting from acquisitions made by us in fiscal special charges typically relate to amounts that we expect to pay in connection with restructuring plans relating to employee workforce reduction and abandonment of excess facilities  impairment of long lived assets  acquisition related costs with effect from july  and onwards and other similar charges 
generally  we implement such plans in the context of streamlining existing open text operations with that of acquired entities 
actions related to such restructuring plans are  more often than not  completed within a period of one year 
in certain limited situations  if the planned activity does not need to be implemented  or an expense lower than anticipated is paid out  we record a recovery of the originally recorded expense to special charges 
in accordance with the new business combination accounting rules which are applicable to us with effect from july   acquisition related expenses are required to be included in the determination of income and may not  as was permitted earlier  be capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisition 
as a result  we recorded an additional expense within special charges of million during fiscal on account of expenses related to these acquisitions 
for more details on special charges  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income expense relates to certain non operational charges consisting primarily of foreign exchange gains losses  changes in the market value of financial assets hedges  and tax related penalties 
for fiscal  net other expense increased by million  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of transactional foreign currency adjustments  offset by a gain of million resulting from re measuring to fair value our investment in vignette common shares held before the date of acquisition see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense is primarily made up of cash interest paid on our debt facilities offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on our long term debt obtained for the purpose of partially financing our hummingbird acquisition the term loan 
the term loan bears floating rate interest at libor plus a fixed rate which is currently set at per annum 
the carrying value of the term loan  as of june   is approximately million 
net interest expense decreased by million primarily due to a decrease in the interest paid on the term loan on account of lower interest rates in fiscal for more details on interest expenses see note to our consolidated financial statements  and also the discussion under long term debt and credit facilities under the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
income taxes the reduction in tax expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the impacts of an internal reorganization of our international subsidiaries initiated to consolidate our intellectual property within certain jurisdictions and to effect an operational reduction of our global subsidiaries with a view to  eventually  having a single operating legal entity in each jurisdiction 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth changes in cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities for the periods indicated in thousands change increase decrease cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased marginally by million in fiscal due to an increase in net income of million and non cash adjustments of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the increase in non cash adjustments was primarily due to i an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  largely as the result of the impact of acquisition related activities and fixed asset purchases  ii an increase in excess tax benefits on share based compensation expense of million and iii an increase in share based compensation expense of million 
these increases were offset by i a decrease in pension expense of million  ii a release of an unrealized gain on marketable securities to income of million  and iii a decrease in deferred taxes of million 
the remaining change in non cash adjustments relates to miscellaneous items 
the decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to  i a decrease in cash flows of million relating to a higher accounts receivable balance  ii a decrease in cash flows of million as a result of a net increase in other assets  and iii a decrease in cash flows of million related to a lower net income taxes payable balance 
these decreases were offset by i an increase in cash flows of million relating to a higher deferred revenue balance  ii an increase in cash flows of million relating to a higher accounts payable balance  and iii an increase in cash flows of million due to a lower prepaid and other assets balance 
the remaining change in operating assets and liabilities relates to miscellaneous items 
overall  the year over year growth in operating cash flows was adversely impacted by increased restructuring costs in fiscal additionally  starting in fiscal acquisition related costs are required to be recorded as a reduction of operating cash flow  whereas in fiscal these could be capitalized as part of the acquisition and hence included under investing costs 
absent the incremental impact of such costs and the internal reorganization costs incurred in fiscal  operating cash flow for fiscal was approximately million 
cash flows used in investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily on account of business acquisitions 
in fiscal  cash flows used in investing activities decreased by approximately million 
this was primarily due to the maturity of short term investments we held  of million which occurred in fiscal and an overall reduction in acquisition related spending of approximately million 
the remainder of the decrease was due to changes in miscellaneous items 
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities consist of long term debt financing and monies received from shares exercised by our employees 
these inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non scheduled repayments of our long term debt financing and  when applicable  the repurchases of our shares 
during fiscal  cash flow from financing activities decreased by million primarily due to i a decrease in the proceeds from common shares exercised by our employees in the amount of million  ii a 
table of contents decrease in excess tax benefits on share based compensation expense in the amount of million  and iii a repurchase of our shares in the amount of million compared to nil in fiscal  to fund an executive long term incentive compensation plan 
the remainder of the decrease was due to other financing related activities 
we did not enter into any new or additional long term debt arrangements during the year 
long term debt and credit facilities on october   we entered into a million credit agreement the credit agreement with a canadian chartered bank the bank consisting of the term loan facility in the amount of million and a million committed revolving long term credit facility the revolver 
the term loan was used to partially finance the hummingbird acquisition and the revolver will be used for general business purposes  if necessary 
no amount has been drawn under the revolver to date 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
for details relating to this and our other credit facilities  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the material financial covenants under our term loan agreement are that we must maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than at the end of each financial quarter 
consolidated leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt  including guarantees and letters of credit  over our trailing twelve months net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and we must maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of or more at the end of each financial quarter 
consolidated interest coverage ratio is defined for this purpose as our consolidated ebitda over our consolidated interest expense 
as of june   the carrying value of the term loan was million and we were in compliance with all loan covenants relating to this facility 
we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  as well as available credit facilities and committed loan facilities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  contractual commitments  and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
any material acquisition related activities may require additional sources of financing 
pensions as part of the acquisition of captaris  we acquired an unfunded pension plan and certain long term employee benefit plans 
as of june   our total unfunded pension plan obligation was million  of which million is payable within the next months 
we expect to be able to make the long term and short term payments related to these obligations  in the normal course 
for a detailed discussion see note to our consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contractual obligations we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum annual payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows payments due by total period ending june  july  june  july  june  july  and beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations net of million of non cancelable sublease income to be received from properties which we have subleased to other parties 

table of contents the long term debt obligations are comprised of interest and principal payments on our term loan agreement and a five year mortgage on our headquarters in waterloo  ontario  canada 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as of june  there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolver  however if the revolver is drawn down  it would increase our contractual obligations 
litigation we are subject from time to time to legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  our management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not enter into off balance sheet financing as a matter of practice except for the use of operating leases for office space  computer equipment  and vehicles 
none of the operating leases described in the previous sentence has  or potentially may have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenue  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
in accordance with us gaap  neither the lease liability nor the underlying asset is carried on the balance sheet  as the terms of the leases do not meet the criteria for capitalization 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
in particular  significant estimates  judgments and assumptions include those related to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts  iii testing goodwill for impairment  iv the valuation of acquired intangible assets  v the valuation of long lived assets  vi the recognition of contingencies  vii restructuring accruals  viii acquisition accruals and pre acquisition contingencies  ix asset retirement obligations  x realization of investment tax credits  xi the valuation of stock options granted and liabilities related to share based payments  including the valuation of our long term incentive plan  xii the valuation of financial instruments  xiii the valuation of pension assets and obligations  and xiv accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition a license revenues we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa in october  as amended by sop issued in december we record product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance by the customer  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 

table of contents our multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and our significant pcs renewal experience  from our existing worldwide base 
our multiple element sales arrangements generally include irrevocable rights for the customer to renew pcs after the bundled term ends 
the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty for failure to renew 
further  the renewal pcs options are for services comparable to the bundled pcs and cover similar terms 
it is our experience that customers generally exercise their renewal pcs option 
in the renewal transaction  pcs is sold on a stand alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement 
the exercised renewal pcs price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement  although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes is not uncommon 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we assess whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring 
our sales arrangements generally include standard payment terms 
these terms effectively relate to all customers  products  and arrangements regardless of customer type  product mix or arrangement size 
exceptions are only made to these standard terms for certain sales in parts of the world where local practice differs 
in these jurisdictions  our customary payment terms are in line with local practice 
b service revenues service revenues consist of revenues from consulting  implementation  training and integration services 
these services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services 
for those contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction  we determine vsoe of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
these consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are  on average  less than six months in length 
revenue from these services is recognized at the time such services are rendered as the time is incurred by us 
we also enter into contracts that are primarily fixed fee arrangements wherein the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element 
in such cases  the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenue 
revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which these services are performed 
c customer support revenues customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to provide pcs to license holders 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advance billings of pcs are not recorded to the extent that the term of the pcs has not commenced and payment has not been received 
deferred revenue deferred revenue primarily relates to support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services 
generally  the services will be provided in the twelve months from signing of the agreement 

table of contents long term sales contracts we entered into certain long term sales contracts involving the sale of integrated solutions that include the modification and customization of software and the provision of services that are essential to the functionality of the other elements in this arrangement 
as prescribed by asc topic  software revenue recognition asc topic  we recognize revenue from such arrangements in accordance with the contract accounting guidelines in asc topic  construction type and production type contracts asc topic  after evaluating for separation of any non asc topic elements in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  multiple element arrangements asc topic 
when circumstances exist that allow us to make reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenues  contract costs and the progress of the contract to completion  we account for sales under such long term contracts using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
under the poc method  progress towards completion of the contract is measured based upon either input measures or output measures 
we measure progress towards completion based upon an input measure and calculate this as the proportion of the actual hours incurred compared to the total estimated hours 
for training and integration services rendered under such contracts  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
we will review  on a quarterly basis  the total estimated remaining costs to completion for each of these contracts and apply the impact of any changes on the poc prospectively 
if at any time we anticipate that the estimated remaining costs to completion will exceed the value of the contract  the loss will be recognized immediately 
when circumstances exist that prevent us from making reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenues  we account for sales under such long term contracts using the completed contract method 
sales to resellers and channel partners we execute certain sales contracts through resellers and distributors collectively  resellers and also large  well capitalized partners such as sap ag and accenture inc collectively  channel partners 
we recognize revenue relating to sales through resellers when all the recognition criteria have been met in other words  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred in the reporting period  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
typically  we recognize revenue to resellers only after the reseller communicates the occurrence of end user sales to us  since we do not have privity of contract with the end user 
in addition we assess the creditworthiness of each reseller and if the reseller is newly formed  undercapitalized or in financial difficulty any revenues expected to emanate from such resellers are deferred and recognized only when cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue relating to sales through channel partners in the reporting period in which we receive evidence  from the channel partner  of end user sales collectively  the documentation and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as a result  if the documentation is not received within a given reporting period we recognize the revenue in a period subsequent to the period in which the channel partner completes the sale to the end user 
rights of return and other incentives we do not generally offer rights of return or any other incentives such as concessions  product rotation  or price protection and  therefore  do not provide for or make estimates of rights of return and similar incentives 
allowance for product returns we provide allowances for estimated returns and return rights that exist for certain legacy captaris customers 
in general  our customers are not granted return rights at the time of sale 
however  captaris has 
table of contents historically accepted returns and  has therefore  reduced recognized revenue for estimated product returns 
for those customers to whom we do grant return rights  we reduce revenue by an estimate of these returns 
if we cannot reasonably estimate these returns  we defer the revenue until the return rights lapse 
for software sold to resellers for which we have granted exchange rights  we defer the revenue until the reseller sells the software through to end users 
when customer acceptance provisions are present and we cannot reasonably estimate returns  we recognize revenue upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
business combinations in fiscal  we adopted accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations asc topic  which revised the accounting guidance that we were required to apply for our acquisitions in comparison to prior fiscal years 
the underlying principles are similar to the previous guidance and require that we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  generally at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that we identify adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income 
as a result of adopting the revised accounting guidance provided for by asc topic as of the beginning of fiscal  certain of our policies differ when accounting for acquisitions in fiscal and future periods in comparison to the accounting for acquisitions in fiscal and prior periods  including the direct transaction costs associated with the business combination are expensed as incurred prior to fiscal  direct transaction costs were included as a part of the purchase price  the costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company are accounted for separately from the business combination prior to fiscal  these restructuring and exit costs were included as a part of the assumed obligations in deriving the purchase price allocation  and changes in estimates associated with income tax valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions after the measurement period are generally recognized as income tax expense with application of this policy also applied prospectively to all of our business combinations regardless of the acquisition date prior to fiscal  any such changes were generally included as a part of the purchase price allocation indefinitely 
costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as one time termination and exit costs pursuant to asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations asc topic  and  as noted above  are accounted for separately from the business combination 
uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information relating to facts and circumstances that existed at acquisition date 
changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances made subsequent to the measurement period or if they relate to facts and circumstances that do not exist at acquisition date  are recorded in our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of income 

table of contents acquired intangibles acquired intangibles consist of acquired technology and customer relationships associated with various acquisitions 
acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income producing capabilities of software products acquired on acquisitions 
we amortize acquired technology over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer relationships represent relationships that we have with customers of the acquired companies and are either based upon contractual or legal rights or are considered separable  that is  capable of being separated from the acquired entity and being sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
these customer relationships are initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
we amortize customer relationships on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate the remaining estimated useful life of our intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
asc topic intangibles goodwill and other asc topic requires the carrying amounts of these assets be periodically reviewed for impairment at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment analysis is comprised of two steps 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units on a geographical basis comprising of three reporting segments north america  europe  and other  other primarily consists of australia  japan  singapore and the united arab emirates 
the primary valuation method selected was the income approach discounted cash flow to estimate the fair value of the reporting units and have also considered the market approach to test the reasonableness of the conclusions reached through the primary approach 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results and related assumptions that are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets could occur 
there have been no significant changes in management s valuation assumptions from the prior year assessment 
the fair value of the reporting units have been determined based upon the present value of future cash flows for each of the reporting units and based upon a discount rate that represents a risk adjusted rate of return 
for this purpose we have used a discount rate of based upon our estimate of the weighted average cost of our capital 
our annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of april  the analysis indicated that carrying values were substantially above their fair values and therefore there was no impairment for goodwill in any of our reporting units during fiscal no impairments were recorded for fiscal and fiscal 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment asc topic 
we test long lived assets or asset groups  such as capital assets and definite lived intangible assets  for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value  which for this purpose is based upon the discounted projected future cash flows of the asset or asset group 
we have not recorded any impairment charges for long lived assets during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal we recorded an impairment charge to intangible assets of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment and based on these evaluations  we adjust our credit limit to the respective customer 
in addition to these evaluations  we conduct on going credit evaluations of our customers payment history and current creditworthiness 
the allowance is maintained for of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible and  for those receivables not specifically identified as uncollectible  an allowance is maintained for a specific percentage of those receivables based upon the aging of accounts  our historical collection experience and current economic expectations 
to date  the actual losses have been within our expectations 
no single customer accounted for more than of the accounts receivable balance as of june  and income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes asc topic 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
these temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
we account for our uncertain tax provisions by using a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not  based solely on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize 
the amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized 
the tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not capable of being sustained 
on subsequent recognition and measurement the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the company s best estimate  given the information available at the reporting date  although the outcome of the tax 
table of contents position is not absolute or final 
upon adopting the revisions in asc topic  we elected to follow an accounting policy to classify accrued interest related to liabilities for income taxes within the interest expense line and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the other expense line of our consolidated statements of income see note to our consolidated financial statements for more details 
restructuring charges we record restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations and other exit costs in accordance with asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations asc topic 
asc topic requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
in order to incur a liability pursuant to asc topic  our management must have established and approved a plan of restructuring in sufficient detail 
a liability for a cost associated with involuntary termination benefits is recorded when benefits have been communicated and a liability for a cost to terminate an operating lease or other contract is incurred when the contract has been terminated in accordance with the contract terms or we have ceased using the right conveyed by the contract  such as vacating a leased facility 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires us to make certain judgments regarding the nature  timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities  including estimating sub lease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances 
for details  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
litigation we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with asc topic contingencies 
share based payment we measure share based compensation costs  in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc topic on the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award 
we have elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period  which in our circumstances is the stated vesting period of the award  provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro rata value of the award that has vested 
compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
this estimate is adjusted in the period once actual forfeitures are known 
for details  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for pensions  post retirement and post employment benefits pension expense is accounted for in accordance with asc topic  compensation retirement benefits asc topic  based upon management s assumptions 
pension expense consists of actuarially computed costs of pension benefits in respect of the current year of service  imputed returns on plan assets for funded plans and imputed interest on pension obligations 
the expected costs of post retirement benefits  other than pensions  are accrued in the financial statements based upon actuarial methods and assumptions 
the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans are recognized as an asset or a liability with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity  respectively  on the balance sheet 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for details relating to our pension plans

our license revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and industry conditions  the competitive strength of our software products  and our acquisitions 
our license business is also characterized by long sales cycles whereby the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues 
license revenue increased by approximately million primarily as the result of increased revenues from our north america operations and the impact of increased partner influenced sales 

table of contents the increase in license revenue is geographically attributable to an increase in north america license sales of million and an increase in license sales in other geographies of million offset by a decrease in europe license sales of million 
overall  our average license transaction size for sales in excess of  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as set out in the table below 
fiscal year fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter customer support revenues consists of revenues from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenue is generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
therefore changes in customer support revenues do not necessarily correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period 
the terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months  with customer renewal options 
customer support revenues increased in fiscal by approximately million 
this was largely due to the growth of our north america operations 
the increase in customer support revenues was attributable to an increase in north america customer support sales of million  an increase in europe customer support sales of million and the remainder of the increase is due to sales generated in other geographies 
service and other revenues 
service revenue consists of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide implementation  training and integration services professional services 
other revenue consists of hardware revenue 
these revenues are grouped within the service and other category because they are relatively immaterial 
professional services  if purchased  are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses 
the increase in services and other revenues is due to an increase in north america service and other revenues of million  offset by a decrease in europe service and other revenues by million 
the remainder of the change in service and other revenues is from revenue generated in other geographies

cost of service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration  customization and training with respect to our various software products 
the most significant components of these costs are personnel related expenses  travel costs and third party subcontracting 
also  starting in the second quarter of fiscal  the cost of selling hardware was grouped within this category 
overall gross margins on service and other revenues have improved as a result of higher margins related to hardware sales 
amortization of acquired technology based intangible assets increased by million due to the increase in intangible assets in fiscal on account of the acquisitions made by us in fiscal operating expenses the following table sets forth total operating expenses by function and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands change increase decrease research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired customer based intangible assets special charges recoveries total in of total revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired customer based intangible assets special charges recoveries research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  contracted research and development expenses  and facility costs 
research and development enables organic growth and as such we dedicate extensive efforts every quarter to update and upgrade our product offering 
the primary driver is typically budgeted software upgrades and software development 

table of contents research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained stable at for both fiscal and research and development expenses increased by approximately million  due to an increase in direct labour and labour related benefits and expenses of million as well as an increase in consulting expenses of million offset by a decrease in overhead expenses of million and a decrease in miscellaneous expenses of million 
the remainder of the difference was due to a decrease in miscellaneous research and development related expenses

headcount at june   related to general and administrative activities increased by employees compared to june  depreciation expenses remained consistent in fiscal as compared to fiscal amortization of acquired intangible customer based assets increased by million due to the increase in intangible assets in fiscal on account of the acquisitions made by us in fiscal special charges recoveries typically relate to amounts that we expect to pay on account of restructuring plans relating to employee workforce reduction and abandonment of excess facilities  impairment of long lived assets and other similar charges 
generally  we implement such plans in the context of streamlining existing open text operations that get impacted by significant acquisitions 
actions related to such restructuring plans are  more often than not  completed within a period of one year 
in certain limited situations  if the planned activity does not need to be implemented  or an expense lower than anticipated is paid out  we record a recovery of the originally recorded expense to special charges 
prior to july   restructuring plans relating to legacy 
table of contents employee workforce reduction and abandonment of legacy excess facilities of the acquired company were not included within special charges  but were accounted for as part of the cost of the acquisition  unless such charges relate to additional accruals recorded after the purchase price allocation period 
the increase in special charges was due to the implementation of the fiscal restructuring plan which was announced in the second quarter of fiscal the plan is designed to restructure our workforce and to rationalize and consolidate our excess facilities 
net interest expense is primarily made up of cash interest paid on our term loan and the unrealized gain loss on our interest rate collar  offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on our million long term debt obtained in october  the term loan  for the purpose of partially financing our hummingbird acquisition 
the term loan bears floating rate interest at libor plus a fixed rate which was currently set at per annum in fiscal net interest expense decreased by million  which is primarily due to a decrease in the interest expense of the long term loan in the amount of million with the remainder of the change due to miscellaneous items 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relate primarily to our term loan  as we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolver as of june  as of june   we had an outstanding balance of million on the term loan 
the term loan bears a floating interest rate of libor plus a fixed rate of 
as of june   an adverse change in libor of basis points would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the term loan by approximately million  assuming that the loan balance as of june   is outstanding for the entire period 
foreign currency risk our reporting currency is the u 
s dollar 
on account of our international operations  a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents is held in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of june   this balance represented approximately of our total cash and cash equivalents 
a adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar would have decreased our reported cash and cash equivalents by approximately 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from subsidiaries  other than those located in the us  are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
these functional currencies include euros  canadian dollars  australian dollars and british pounds 
the income statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the foreign currency conversion of these foreign currency denominated transactions into us dollars results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income loss for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income loss will increase for our international operations  if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
we cannot predict the effect foreign exchange fluctuations will have on our results going forward 
however  if there is a change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar  it could have a material effect on our results of operations
