overview we are a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems  primarily for the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
we also leverage the specialized skill sets required to support semiconductor capital equipment to serve the technologically similar markets in the flat panel  medical  energy and research industries  collectively referred to as other addressed industries 
we develop  design  prototype  engineer  manufacture and test subsystems which are highly specialized and tailored to specific steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process as well as the manufacturing process in other addressed industries 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems including chemical mechanical planarization cmp subsystems  chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies  process modules and other high level assemblies 
the global economy has contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate 
reduced growth and uncertainty regarding future growth in economies throughout the world have caused companies to reduce capital investment and may in the future cause further reduction of such investments 
economic uncertainty has led to low consumer confidence levels and has caused and may in the future cause our customers to push out  cancel  or refrain from placing orders with us  which in turn has reduced and may in the future reduce our sales and negatively impact our cash flow 
our sales were million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year our three largest customers in were applied materials  inc  intuitive surgical  inc  and lam research corporation  each of which accounted for more than of our total sales in and as a group these three customers accounted for and of the company s sales for and  respectively 
in  applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc each accounted for more than of our total sales and as a group accounted for of total sales 
we incurred a net loss of million for  however  we expect a positive yet challenging environment for fiscal as the company ramps for its expected higher sequential revenues in the first quarter of 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue year ended january  january  december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill impairment of long lived assets total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss year ended january  compared with year ended january  sales sales for the year ended january  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the change in sales reflects a decrease in semi conductor equipment and non semiconductor demand as a result of the overall slowdown in the global economy 
we expect sequential revenues to be higher in the first quarter of gross profit cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  inventory write downs  labor and overhead  including depreciation  associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
gross profit for the year ended january  decreased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for the year ended january  the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to declining unit volume manufactured due to declining sales during fiscal year and lower factory utilization in compared to research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of activities related to new component testing and evaluation  test equipment  design and implementation  new product design and testing and other product development activities 
research and development expense increased slightly to million  or of sales  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of sales for the year ended january  the increase in expense is primarily due to the reassignment of existing resources to new product development activities 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our sales and service employees  salaries paid to our engineers who work with our sales and service employees to help determine the components and configuration requirements for new products and other costs related to the sales of our products 
sales and marketing expense was million and million for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
the decrease in spending was due primarily to reduced headcount related expenses as a result of reduced headcount  salary reductions and lower sales commissions 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense increased to for the year ended january  compared to for the year ended january  due to the lower revenue base in compared as to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and overhead of our administrative staff and professional fees 
general and administrative expense decreased to million  or of sales  for the year ended january   from million  or of sales  for the year ended january  the decrease in expense is due to primarily to reduced payroll and related benefit costs due to decreases in headcount and salary reductions 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets during  as a result of our annual impairment test of goodwill  we determined that the carrying amount of certain reporting units exceeded their fair value resulting in impairment charges of million to goodwill see note to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that an adverse change in our business climate required us to test the recoverability of our long lived assets 
as a result of these tests we determined that the carrying amount of certain reporting units had exceeded their fair value resulting in impairment charges of million for other intangible assets and million for property  plant and equipment 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal components of interest and other income expense relate primarily to the interest expense incurred for debt financing 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million in the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates on debt 
as a result of a new loan agreement with our credit facility in the first quarter of  the average interest rates on our debt have remained flat during the year and are similar to the average interest rates applied on our debt facilities during the same period in the prior year 
interest expense was lower for fiscal year compared to due primarily to lower average debt balances 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for the year ended january  was compared to an income tax benefit of for the year ended january  our effective tax rate is substantially impacted by several items including section deduction for domestic production activities  state taxes and the effect of foreign operations  as well as a change in our geographic mix of us and china earnings 
year ended january  compared with year ended december  sales sales for the year ended january  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales reflected a decrease in semi conductor equipment demand as a result of the overall slowdown in the industry  partially offset by sequential minor increases in non semiconductor revenue 

table of contents gross profit gross profit for the year ended january  decreased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to declining unit volume manufactured due to declining sales during fiscal year  lower factory utilization  costs associated with the centralization and closure of our facilities and employee severance charges resulting from a series of reductions in force 
research and development expense research and development expense remained relatively flat decreasing to million  or of sales  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of sales for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of sales was due primarily to a lower revenue base in as compared to sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense was million and million for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
the decreased spending was due primarily to reduced travel expense and sales commissions offset by an increase in severance payments 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense increased to for the year ended january  compared to for the year ended december  due to the lower revenue base in compared as to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased to million  or of sales  for the year ended january   from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in spending was due to lower outside service costs of approximately million resulting from reduced accounting and consulting costs related to sox compliance and reduced legal fees 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in facility expenses related to the move to our new facility in hayward  california in mid fiscal  higher depreciation costs due to the implementation of our new erp system in late fiscal and employee severance charges resulting from a series of reductions in force 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets during fiscal  as a result of our annual impairment test of goodwill  we determined that the carrying amount of certain reporting units exceeded their fair value resulting in impairment charges of million to goodwill see note to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that an adverse change in our business climate required us to test the recoverability of our long lived assets 
as a result of these tests we determined that the carrying amount of certain reporting units had exceeded their fair value resulting in impairment charges of million for other intangible assets and million for property  plant and equipment 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for fiscal was million compared to million in components of interest and other income expense related primarily to the interest expense incurred for debt financing 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million in the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates on debt 
this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in interest income of approximately million 

table of contents income tax provision our effective tax rate for fiscal year was a benefit of compared to for fiscal year our effective tax rate was substantially impacted by several items including section deduction for domestic production activities  state taxes and the effect of foreign operations  and in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our effective tax rate was impacted by the impairment of goodwill for which there is no tax benefit 
the decreased rate in reflected primarily the impact of our goodwill impairment charge as well as a change in our geographic mix of us and china earnings 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  inventories  intangible assets  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  business combinations  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and equity incentives to employees to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenue is highly concentrated in four oem customers in the semiconductor capital equipment  energy  flat panel and medical industries 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we ship the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product 
in arrangements which specify title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in addition  if we have not fulfilled the terms of the agreement at the time of shipment  revenue recognition is deferred until completion 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of  and do not require collateral from  our customers 
we have not experienced significant collection losses in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability 
inventory valuation we write down the carrying value of our inventory to net realizable value for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is 
table of contents written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specific identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a subsystem or as separate inventory 
for the years ended january  and january   we wrote off million and million  respectively  in inventory determined to be obsolete 
accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of tax deductions  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
in determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
based on our recent historical operating results and our outlook for fiscal and beyond  we determined it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as such  in the second quarter of  we recorded a tax valuation allowance reducing our deferred tax asset value of million to zero with a corresponding non cash charge 
for fiscal we recorded a tax valuation allowance totaling million 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for the tax years and the outcome of the examination is not known  and therefore  we are unable to estimate the effect of the audit to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s and state income tax returns are currently under examination by the california franchise tax board cftb 
the company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the internal revenue service for fiscal years through and the company s state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the fiscal years through business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we may engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets such as trade name and customer relationships 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets we evaluate our intangible assets in accordance with the fasb s guidance regarding accounting for the impairment of goodwill  at least annually  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in 
table of contents circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  such as an adverse change in our business climate or a decline in the overall industry  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company s only intangible asset is tradename 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the provisions of the fasb s guidance regarding accounting for the impairment of goodwill require an impairment test annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in testing for a potential impairment  the provisions of the fasb s guidance regarding accounting for the impairment of goodwill require the application of a fair value based test at the reporting unit level 
we operate in one reportable segment and have one reporting unit 
therefore  all goodwill is considered enterprise goodwill and the first step of the impairment test prescribed by the fasb s guidance regarding accounting for the impairment of goodwill requires a comparison of our fair value to our book value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the book value  the fasb s guidance regarding accounting for the impairment of goodwill requires an estimate of the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this estimate requires valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development and developed technology 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon this two step process 
in accordance with the fasb s guidance regarding accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company tests other long lived assets  including property  equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  the company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach  which is the present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flow produced by each asset group  and compare it to its carrying value 
the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value 
the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value 
see additional disclosure of these analyses in note to our consolidated financial statements including the impairment charges recorded during the fiscal year the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill or long lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as  but not limited to  the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment and the asset group to be tested for recoverability 
the company is also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  future operating performance and cash flows  cost of capital  terminal values  control premiums and remaining economic lives of assets 
equity incentives to employees we have accounted for stock based compensation under the fasb s guidance regarding stock based compensation and the sec s guidance requiring the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of underlying stock 
our expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of our common stock 
we determined that historical volatility reflects market conditions and is a good indicator of future volatility 
our expected term represents the period 
table of contents that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on our historical experience with similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules

unaudited quarterly financial results the following tables set forth statement of operations data  in thousands  for the periods indicated 
the information for each of these periods is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included herein and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our unaudited operations data for the periods presented 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year sales gross profit loss net income loss sales gross profit net income loss our operating results for fiscal reflect a downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry beginning in the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs  satisfy our debt obligations  maintain our equipment and purchase new capital equipment 
as of january   we had cash of million compared to million as of january  for the year ended january  we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to million for the year ended january  operating cash flow in was unfavorably impacted by our net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in other liabilities of  operating cash flows were favorably impacted by net non cash activity of million  including depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million and increased net deferred income taxes of million  an increase in accounts payable of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended january  decreased million to million from million in the year ended january  investing activities in were high due primarily to our investment in equipment and leasehold improvements for our new hayward  california facility 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended january  decreased million to million from million in the year ended january  our use of cash in financing activities was primarily due to net principal payments on short term debt of million 
during fiscal and  we took steps to reduce our operating costs in line with our declining revenues in the form of factory shutdowns  reductions in headcount and other cost cutting measures 
we anticipate that our existing cash balance and operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under our credit facility as amended on february  see borrowing arrangements below  will be sufficient to meet our working 
table of contents capital requirements and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  the state of the worldwide economy  the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the other industries we serve and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
borrowing arrangements in the second quarter of  the company entered into a borrowing arrangement and a term loan loan agreement 
the loan agreement provided senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  consisting of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan original term loan 
on february   the company amended its loan agreement resulting in a reduction of the revolving credit facility from million to million while extending its maturity to january   and instituting a new million  three year term loan  as amended  also maturing on january  the original term loan expired on june  the outstanding balance of the new term loan as of january  was approximately million 
the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory total eligible inventory not to exceed million and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the revolving credit facility bears interest per annum at a variable rate equal to the greater of the bank s stated prime rate or plus a margin of basis points 
the new term loan  as amended  bears interest per annum at a variable rate equal to the greater of the bank s stated prime rate or plus a margin of basis points 
the revolving credit facility contains certain reporting and financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth and liquidity ratios that must be met on a monthly basis in order for the company to remain in compliance 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants in our loan agreement 
the outstanding balance of the revolving line of credit as of january  was approximately million 
interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility and the term loan ranged from to per annum during fiscal year and were and per annum  respectively  as of january  the company also has a million equipment loan that is secured by certain of its equipment and expires in may the interest rate and outstanding balance on the equipment loan was and million  respectively  as of january  the combined balance outstanding on the loan agreement and equipment loan at january  was million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million in the year ended january   primarily due to the fixed assets acquired from allegro for our singapore location 
see note for further discussion 
we made capital expenditures of million in the year ended january   million of which was used for our new headquarters in hayward  california and million was used for expansion of our facilities in china 
capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  was used primarily for facilities expansion in china and the implementation of our new erp system which went live during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents contractual obligations other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate  we have no off balance sheet transactions  unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments and  other than the revolving credit facility described above  are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
the following table summarizes our future minimum lease payments and principal payments under debt obligations as of january  in thousands thereafter total capital lease operating lease borrowing arrangements purchase obligations total operating lease expense reflects a the lease for our headquarters facility in hayward  california  b the lease for a manufacturing facility in portland  oregon that expires on october  net of estimated sublease rental income  c the leases for manufacturing facilities in south san francisco that expire from through  d the leases for manufacturing facilities in austin  texas that expire in and as a result of the implementation of fasb s guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we have recorded an additional tax liability to offset the recognition of previously recorded excess tax benefits 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the future payment of these liabilities  the amount has been excluded from the table above 
recently issued accounting standards during the second quarter of  the company adopted the fasb s guidance regarding the disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual financial statements 
this guidance also amends previous guidance regarding interim financial reporting  to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
the adoption of this guidance had no financial impact on the company s condensed consolidated financial statements or related footnotes 
in may  the fasb issued its guidance regarding subsequent events  which established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events 
the company adopted this guidance during its second quarter of in june  the fasb issued guidance regarding accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this guidance has become the single official source of authoritative us gaap other than guidance issued by the sec  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants  emerging issues task force eitf  and related literature 
one level of authoritative us gaap will exist  and all other literature will be considered non authoritative 
the company has adopted this guidance and has updated its disclosures to conform to the codification in this form q 
during the first quarter of the company adopted the fasb s guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets which amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under the fasb s guidance regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of this guidance had no financial impact on the company s condensed consolidated financial statements or related footnotes 
in april  the fasb issued guidance regarding the determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset or liability has 
table of contents declined significantly 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted this guidance  which did not have a financial impact on the company s condensed consolidated financial statements or related footnotes 
in september  the fasb issued guidance regarding the fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
during the first quarter of the company adopted this guidance for the company s non financial assets and non financial liabilities without impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements or related footnotes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign exchange rates currently  a significant majority of our sales and arrangements with third party suppliers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to material exchange rate fluctuations 
therefore  we do not expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have a material effect on our results of operations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
interest rates our interest rate risk relates primarily to our third party debt which totals million and carries interest rates pegged to the libor and prime rates 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase our interest expense by approximately  per quarter 
this would be partially offset by increased interest income on our invested cash 
conversely  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates would decrease our interest expense by approximately  per quarter 
this would be partially offset by decreased interest income on our invested cash
