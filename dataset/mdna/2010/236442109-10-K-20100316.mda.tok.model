item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the purpose of management s discussion and analysis is to focus on certain significant factors that have affected our operating results and financial condition  and to provide shareholders a more comprehensive review of the financial data contained in the report 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this report 
general danvers bancorp  inc is the holding company for danversbank 
on october   the company acquired beverly national corporation and on february   all beverly national bank customer deposit and loan accounts were merged into danversbank 
danversbank is a community bank primarily providing commercial and industrial  or c i  commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans and a variety of retail deposit products and services to our business and retail customers 
long term growth is an essential element in our business plan 
lending is the major driver of revenue and we are committed to supporting our loan growth 
we recognize that loan and deposit growth are interdependent and over the long term both must grow consistently 
one of our biggest challenges is to grow our customer base and to grow the depth and breadth of our customer relationships 
we address this challenge by maintaining our focus on anticipating  understanding and assisting our customers in achieving their financial goals 
our results of operations depend  to a large extent  on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income represented and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  and our net interest margin was and  respectively 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of the regulatory agencies 
general economic conditions and a continued decline in the real estate markets could affect the demand for our loan and other products and the ability of borrowers to repay loans  which could in turn lead to a decline in credit quality and increased loan losses 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations are also affected by fee income from banking and non banking operations  provisions for loan losses  loan servicing and other non interest income 
non interest expense principally consists of employee compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  data processing  advertising  business development and other expense 
we use the efficiency ratio non interest expense for the period minus expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets divided by the sum of net interest income before the loan loss provision plus non interest income and the expense ratio non interest expense to total average assets as the primary measurements to monitor and control non interest expense 
for the years ended december  and  our efficiency and expense ratios were and and and  respectively 
despite our continued balance sheet growth  the industry wide margin compression has mitigated much of the associated revenue growth over the past two years  thereby contributing to the adverse trends in our efficiency and expense ratios 
as a result of the conversion from a mutual bank to a stock corporation  we incurred a number of one time expenses that adversely impacted our expense ratios 
management has implemented various expense reduction initiatives aimed at controlling our non interest expenses 
danversbank s net interest margin improved during the years ended december  and and revenues have also increased 
in the absence of further margin 
table of contents compression  management expects revenues will eventually rise and that as a result  our efficiency ratio is expected to improve 
post conversion 
while this discussion focuses primarily on past performance  there are several facets of our operation that were significantly affected in due to the conversion and the acquisition 
the offering proceeds have substantially increased our capital and our capital ratios have increased accordingly 
as we deploy the capital over the next several years  we expect these ratios will decline 
our gross revenues benefited from the earnings on the offering proceeds 
however  our non interest expenses also increased as a result of becoming a public company  particularly in the areas of audit  investor relations  periodic filings  and compliance with new internal control reporting and governance requirements and branch expansion 
we also incurred higher legal costs and other miscellaneous holding company expenses 
there were increased expenses associated with employee benefits  particularly our new employee stock ownership plan and phantom stock plan for which the change in control provisions were triggered by the conversion 
the contribution to establish the danversbank charitable foundation  inc resulted in a million one time charge in the first quarter of the conversion also resulted in a million one time charge during the first quarter of related to the immediate vesting and payout of danversbank s phantom stock plan 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assessments by management  and which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered critical due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the underlying assumptions used  and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in material changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered necessary 
the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and the board of directors and is based on a periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and size of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
for a full discussion of the allowance for loan losses  please refer to business asset quality allowance for loan losses on page other real estate owned 
oreo includes property acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and is recorded fair value  less estimated costs to sell  at the time of acquisition 
the excess  if any  of the loan balance over the fair value of the property at the time of transfer from loans to oreo is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to the transfer to oreo  if the fair value of the property less estimated selling costs is less than the carrying value of the property  the deficiency is charged to income 
due to changing market conditions  there are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions with respect to the estimated fair value of oreo 
therefore  the amount ultimately realized may differ from the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the company s goodwill and intangible assets are the result of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed arising from acquisitions of other financial institutions and the long term value of depositor relationships arising from the contractual rights acquired in the acquisition of financial institutions 
the company accounts for its goodwill and intangible assets using the acquisition method 
the recorded fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is an estimate determined by a third party valuation model 

table of contents the company will test for goodwill impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates the realizability of intangible assets based on the value of the underlying depositor relationships 
if the value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  the company would recognize an impairment loss 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability or balance sheet method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when  based upon the available evidence including historical and projected taxable income  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized see note to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f 
income tax benefits related to stock compensation in excess of grant date fair value less any proceeds on exercise are recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital upon vesting or exercising and delivery of the stock 
any income tax effects related to stock compensation that are less than grant date fair value less any proceeds on exercise would be recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital to the extent of previously recognized income tax benefits and then through income tax expense for the remaining amount 
this discussion has highlighted those accounting policies that management considers critical  however  all accounting policies are important  and therefore you are encouraged to review each of the policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f to gain a better understanding of how our financial performance is measured and reported 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and the expense on interest bearing liabilities

we document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
in conjunction with an independent third party  we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
the company offers certain derivative products directly to qualified commercial borrowers 
the company economically hedges derivative transactions executed with commercial borrowers by entering into mirror image  offsetting derivatives with third parties 
derivative transactions executed as part of this program are not designated as qualifying hedging relationships and are  therefore  marked to market through earnings each period 
because the derivatives have mirror image contractual terms  the changes in fair value substantially offset one another through earnings 
during  the company entered into five of these interest rate swap agreements that mature at various dates ranging from december  through may  the notional amount of the interest rate swaps was  with a variable pay rate of the month libor and a fixed receive rate ranging from through

danversbank does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without 
table of contents considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  and therefore the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on its performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
impact of recent accounting standards in june  the fasb issued guidance  which is incorporated in asc topic  that improves financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
asc topic guidance changes the accounting principles and disclosure requirements related to securitizations and special purpose entities 
specifically  this guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and changes how a company determines when an entity this is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
this guidance also expands existing disclosure requirements to include more information about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
this guidance will be effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
the recognition and measurement provisions regarding transfers of financial assets shall be applied to transfers that occur on or after the effective date 
the company will adopt this new guidance on january   as required 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management recognizes that managing risk is fundamental to the business of banking and to the safe and sound operation of danversbank 
through the development  implementation and monitoring of its policies with respect to risk management  danversbank strives to measure  evaluate and control the risks it faces 
the most significant risks faced by danversbank are credit risk  market risk including interest rate risk  liquidity risk  operational or transaction risk and compliance risk 
within management  the responsibility for risk management rests with the risk management committee chaired by the executive vice president and chief operating officer  the chief executive officer  chief information officer  chief financial officer  compliance officer and a number of other senior department heads 
the risk management committee periodically reviews the status of our risk management practices  internal and external audit findings  new business  product or service initiatives  emerging regulatory compliance standards and issues  technology initiatives  insurance  the activities of the asset liability committee  or alco  with respect to monitoring interest rate and liquidity risk and a host of other operational issues 
the committee tracks any open items requiring corrective action with the goal of ensuring that each item is addressed on a timely basis 
the executive vice president and chief operating officer reports activities of the risk management committee and status of risk management practices directly to the danvers bancorp  inc audit committee 
management of credit risk 
danversbank considers credit risk to be the most significant risk it faces  in that it has the greatest potential to affect our financial condition and operating results 
credit risk is managed through a combination of policies established by the board of directors of danversbank  the monitoring of compliance with these policies  and the periodic evaluation of loans in the portfolio  including those with problem characteristics 
in general  danversbank s policies establish maximums on the amount of credit that may be granted to a single borrower including affiliates  the aggregate amount of loans outstanding by type in relation to total assets and capital  loan concentrations  underwriting authority and approval limits and processes 
collateral and debt service 
table of contents coverage ratios and other underwriting criteria are also specified 
policies also exist with respect to performing periodic credit reviews  the rating of loans  when loans should be placed on non performing status and factors that should be considered in establishing danversbank s allowance for possible loan losses 
management is aided in these efforts by the use of an independent third party that conducts outside reviews of danversbank s loan portfolio three times per year 
for additional information  refer to business lending activities on page management of market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates  and typically encompasses exposures such as sensitivity to changes in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
danversbank has no exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodity price movements 
because net interest income is danversbank s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is a significant market risk to which danversbank is exposed 
interest rate risk is the exposure of danversbank s net interest income in response to movements in interest rates 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as by fluctuations in the level and duration of danversbank s assets and liabilities 
over and above the influence that interest rates have on net interest income  changes in rates may also affect the volume of lending activity  the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans  the volume of loan prepayments and refinancing  the availability  mix and cost of deposits and other funding alternatives  and the market value of danversbank s assets and liabilities 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by danversbank through periodic evaluations of the current interest rate risk inherent in its rate sensitive assets and liabilities  primarily deposits  borrowings  loans and investment securities  coupled with determinations of the level of risk considered appropriate given danversbank s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy and performance objectives 
through such management  danversbank seeks to manage the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
strategies used by danversbank to manage the potential volatility of its earnings may include emphasizing the origination and retention of variable rate c i loans and commercial real estate loans  adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit  investing in securities with relatively short maturities and or expected average lives  classifying nearly all of the investment portfolio as available for sale in order to provide for flexibility in liquidity management  and lengthening liabilities such as term certificates of deposit and federal home loan bank of boston borrowings as appropriate 
the asset liability committee  or alco  chaired by the chief financial officer and comprised of several members of senior management  is responsible for managing interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  this committee reviews with the board of directors its analysis of our exposure to interest rate risk  the effect subsequent changes in interest rates could have on danversbank s future net interest income  key interest rate risk strategies and other activities  and the effect of those strategies on danversbank s operating results 
this committee is also actively involved in danversbank s planning and budgeting process as well as in determining pricing strategies for deposits and loans 
management is aided in these efforts by the use of an independent third party that convenes with management on a quarterly basis for a complete asset liability analysis and review 
the primary method that alco uses for measuring and evaluating interest rate risk is an income simulation analysis 
this analysis considers the maturity and interest rate repricing characteristics of all of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet components over a range of interest rate scenarios 
interest rate scenarios tested 
table of contents generally include parallel and flattening steepening rate ramps over a one year period  and static  or flat  rates 
the simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon  usually a two year period 
the simulations also show the net interest income volatility for up to five years 
for december   we used a simulation model to project changes for three rate scenarios 
no simulation was run for the falling rate scenarios given that the federal funds rate is currently in the range between and basis points 
this analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasts for these scenarios compared to the net interest income forecast using a flat rate scenario 
in each of these instances  federal funds is used as the driving rate 
the table below sets forth  as of december   the estimated changes in danversbank s net interest income that would result 
net portfolio value net interest income estimated increase decrease increase decrease in estimated net interest income change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated net interest income amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands bp     bp     bp     bp   assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re pricing relationships for each of our products 
many of our assets are floating rate loans tied to the prime rate or libor  which are assumed to re price immediately and to the same extent as the change in market rates  according to their contracted index 
many of these credit relationships  however  now have interest rate floors at above market levels 
many of these loans may not re price with the first couple of increases in short term interest rates 
conversely  we have various transaction account products that would not increase or decrease in the same increments or at the same speed 
money market accounts  as an example  are assumed to increase sooner and in larger increments than savings and now accounts 
these assumptions are based on our prior experience with the changes in rates paid on these non maturity deposits coincident with changes in market interest rates 
the model begins by disseminating data into appropriate repricing buckets 
assets and liabilities are then assigned a multiplier to simulate how much that particular balance sheet item will reprice when interest rates change 
the final step is to simulate the timing effect of assets and liabilities with a month by month simulation to estimate the change in interest income and expense over the next months 
this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it does not incorporate any balance sheet growth  and it assumes that the structure and composition of the balance sheet will remain comparable to the structure at the start of the simulation 
it does not account for other factors that might impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income 

table of contents for the rising interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased  on an instantaneous and sustained basis  by  and basis points 
at december   our net interest income exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within our established guidelines 
there are inherent shortcomings to income simulations  given the number and variety of assumptions that must be made in performing the analysis 
the assumptions relied upon in making these calculations of interest rate sensitivity include the level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar attributes react to changes in market interest rates  and the degree to which non maturity deposits  such as checking accounts  react to changes in market rates 
although the analysis shown above provides an indication of danversbank s sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time  these estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on danversbank s net interest income and may differ from actual results 
liquidity risk management 
liquidity risk is the risk to earnings and capital arising from an organization s inability to meet its obligations without incurring unacceptable losses 
this risk is managed by danversbank s chief operating officer and chief financial officer  who monitor on a daily basis the adequacy of danversbank s liquidity position 
oversight and updates are provided through weekly meetings of the finance department and by the alco  which reviews danversbank s liquidity position on a quarterly basis 
the board of directors of the company reviews the adequacy of our liquidity resources on a quarterly basis as well 
our primary sources of funds are from deposits  customer repurchase agreements  amortization  prepayments  the maturity of loans and mortgage backed securities and the maturity of other investments  and other funds provided by operations 
while scheduled payments from amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by the interest rate environment  economic conditions and competition 
we maintain excess funding in the form of cash and short term interest bearing deposits with one or more of our correspondent banking relationships 
at december   cash and due from banks and cash equivalents totaled million or of total assets 
we also rely on borrowings from the fhlbb as an additional funding source 
over the past several years  danversbank has expanded its use of fhlbb advances to fund growth in the loan portfolio and to assist in the management of its interest rate risk 
danversbank s deposits increased by million during the year ended december   and this was augmented by increases in outstanding fhlbb advances of million 
as of december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million from the fhlbb 
we use our liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and borrowings  to fund other deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets and to meet operating expenses 
danversbank anticipates that it will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet its commitments 
we intend to expand our lending activities 
the cash flow required to fund those potential increases in loans will likely be provided primarily by increases in deposits  as we implement our strategy to expand our franchise geographically and to increase our deposit market share in areas where danversbank already has a presence 
to the extent that cash flow provided by our deposit gathering efforts does not completely fund increases in loans and investments  we will likely borrow funds from the fhlbb to provide the necessary cash flow 
the capital necessary to support future growth in assets is anticipated to be provided by our capital resources in hand following the conversion  augmented over time by increases from net income  net of dividends paid  if any 

table of contents contractual obligations 
the following table presents information indicating various contractual obligations and commitments of danversbank as of december  and their respective maturity dates up to one year more than one year to two years more than two years to three years more than three years to five years more than five years total in thousands federal home loan bank advances repurchase agreements subordinated debt operating leases total all repurchase agreements mature on a daily basis and are secured by obligations of government sponsored enterprises 
loan commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
the following table presents information indicating various danversbank s loan commitments outstanding and their respective maturity dates as of december  one year or less more than one year to two years more than two years to three years more than three years to five years more than five years total in thousands commitments to grant loans unfunded commitments under lines of credit unadvanced funds on construction loans commercial and standby letters of credit management of other risks 
two additional risk areas that receive significant attention by management and the board of directors are operational risk and compliance risk 
operational risk is the risk to earnings and capital arising from control deficiencies  problems with information systems  fraud  error or unforeseen catastrophes 
compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of  or nonconformance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  internal policies and procedures or ethical standards 
compliance risk can expose danversbank to fines  civil money penalties  payment of damages and the voiding of contracts 
danversbank addresses such risks through the establishment of comprehensive policies and procedures with respect to internal controls  the management and operation of its information and communication systems  business contingency and disaster recovery  and compliance with laws  regulations and banking industry best practice 
monitoring of the effectiveness of policies  procedures and our internal control structure is performed through a combination of danversbank s internal audit program  through periodic internal and third party compliance reviews  and through the ongoing 
table of contents attention of our managers charged with supervising compliance and operational controls 
oversight of these activities is provided by the internal audit services department  risk management committee and the audit committee of the board of directors of the company
