table of contents item a 
risk factors there are many factors that affect our business and the results of our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
the risks described in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   are not the only risks facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or operating results 
because of the significant percentage of our sales to certain customers  the loss of  or a substantial decline in sales to  a top customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
for  and  we derived   and  respectively  of our revenues from our five largest customers during these periods 
these five customers were danaher  nokia siemens networks  philips healthcare  okaya end customer fujitsu and miltope  which each purchase a variety of products from us 
during  and  revenues attributable to nokia siemens networks were   and  respectively 
because of our significant customer concentration  our largest customers have additional pricing power over us 
further  a financial hardship experienced by  or a substantial decrease in sales to  any one of our customers could materially affect our revenues and profitability 
generally  our products are building blocks for our customers products and  in certain instances  our customers are not the end users of our products 
if any of these customers efforts to market the products we design and manufacture for them or the end products into which our products are incorporated are unsuccessful in the marketplace or if these customers experience a decrease in demand for such products  our design wins  sales and or profitability will be significantly reduced 
furthermore  if these customers experience adverse economic conditions in the end markets into which they sell our products  we would expect a significant reduction in spending by these customers in addition to increasing our exposure to credit risk  which may limit our ability to collect 
some of these end markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change and economic uncertainty and as such there is no guarantee that the revenues associated with the potential loss of a key customer will be replaced by the establishment of new business relationships 
our exposure to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in demand from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
our ability  as well as our contract manufacturers ability  to meet customer demand depends largely on our ability to obtain raw materials and a reduction or disruption in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our business 
the continued global economic contraction has caused many of our component suppliers to reduce their manufacturing capacity 
as the global economy improves  our component suppliers are experiencing and will continue to experience supply constraints until they expand capacity to meet increased levels of demand 
these supply constraints may adversely affect the availability and lead times of components for our products 
increased lead times mean we may have to forsake flexibility in aligning our supply to customer demand changes and increase our exposure to excess inventory since we may have to order material earlier and in larger quantities 
further  supply constraints will likely result in increased expedite and overall procurement costs as we attempt to meet customer demand requirements 
in addition  these supply constraints may affect our ability  as well as our contract manufacturers ability  to meet customer demand and thus result in missed sales opportunities and a loss of market share  negatively impacting revenues and our overall operating results 
our projections of future revenues and earnings are highly subjective and may not reflect future results which could cause volatility in the price of our common stock 
we have several contracts with most of our major customers but these contracts do not commit them to purchase a minimum amount of our products 
these contracts generally require our customers to provide us with forecasts of their anticipated purchases 
however  our experience indicates that customers can change their purchasing patterns quickly in response to market demands  changes in their management or strategy  among other factors  and therefore these forecasts may not be relied upon to accurately forecast sales 
from time to time we provide projections to our shareholders and the investment community of our future sales and earnings 
since 
table of contents we do not have long term purchase commitments from our major customers and the customer order cycle is short  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the amount of our sales and related earnings in any given period 
our projections are based on management s best estimate of sales using historical sales data  information from customers and other information deemed relevant 
these projections are highly subjective since sales to our customers can fluctuate substantially based on the demands of their customers and the relevant markets 
our period to period revenues have varied in the past and may continue to vary in the future 
unanticipated reductions in purchase orders from our customers may also result in us having to write off excess or obsolete inventory 
in addition and as stated above  we have a high degree of customer concentration 
any significant change in purchases by any one of our large customers can significantly affect our sales and profitability 
if demand for our products fluctuates  our revenues  profitability and financial condition could be adversely affected 
important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include changes in customer product needs  changes in the level of customers inventory  changes in business and economic conditions  changes in the mix of products we sell  and market acceptance of our products 
the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by numerous factors  such as general economic and market conditions  changes in analysts estimates regarding earnings as well as factors relating to the commercial systems and communication networking markets in general 
we cannot accurately forecast all of the above factors 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons may not be indicative of future operating results 
our operating results in any future period may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
the growth of our business is dependent in part on successfully implementing our international expansion strategy 
during  we launched two significant strategic initiatives within manufacturing operations and engineering 
as part of the initiatives  we plan to transition to a fully outsourced manufacturing model  which will transfer remaining manufacturing from our manufacturing plant in hillsboro  oregon to our contract manufacturing partners in asia 
the plan also includes consolidating our north american research and development positions and programs and expanding our research and development operations in shanghai  china 
as part of this expansion in china  we have doubled our engineering space and have begun increasing headcount in that location 
both of these strategic initiatives increase our international presence  which along with our existing international operations involve risks inherent in doing business on an international level 
these risks include the following difficulties in managing operations due to distance  language  and cultural differences  different or conflicting laws and regulations  accounting including managing internal control over financial reporting in our non us subsidiaries  tax and legal complexities arising from international operations  burdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements  including data protection requirements  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and different laws and regulations surrounding taxes and their potentially adverse consequences 

table of contents our foreign currency exchange risk management program reduces  but does not eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
if we cannot manage our international operations successfully  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our customers and suppliers are exposed to risks associated with the worldwide economic downturn and financial turmoil that could adversely affect their payment of our invoices or the continuation of their businesses at the same level 
the businesses of many of our customers and suppliers are exposed to risks related to the current economic environment 
a number of our customers and suppliers have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the worldwide financial turmoil  disruptions to the capital and credit markets and decreased demand for their products and services 
in the event that any of our large customers or suppliers  or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers  are adversely affected by these risks  we may face disruptions in supply  further reductions in demand for our products and services  failure of customers to pay invoices when due and other adverse effects that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our failure to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions and ongoing demands for greater speed and functionality 
therefore  we must continually design  develop and introduce new products with improved features to be competitive 
to introduce these products on a timely basis we must design innovative and performance improving features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  including new standards for our products  accurately define and design new products to meet market needs  anticipate changes in end user preferences with respect to our customers products  rapidly develop and produce these products at competitive prices  respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others  and provide effective technical and post sales support for these new products as they are deployed 
not all new design wins ramp into production  and even if ramped into production  the timing of such production may not occur as we or our customers had estimated or the volumes derived from such projects may not be as significant as we had estimated  which could have a substantial negative impact on our anticipated revenues and profitability 
our revenue growth expectations for our next generation products are highly dependent upon successful ramping of our design wins 
the time between when we achieve a design win with a customer and when we begin shipping to that customer at production levels generally has been shortened with our standards based model 
in some cases there is no time in between when a design win is achieved and when production level shipments begin 
with many new design wins with our atca platforms and our com express module s  customers may require us to provide customization to our products 
in addition  customers may require significant time to port their own applications to our systems 
customization of our products as well as porting of customer specific applications can take six to twelve months and in some circumstances can be as long as months 
after that  there is an additional time lag from the start of production ramp to peak revenue 
not all design wins ramp into production and  even if a design win ramps into production  the volumes derived from such projects may be less than we had originally estimated 
customer projects related to design wins are sometimes canceled or delayed  or can perform below original expectations  which can adversely impact anticipated revenues and profitability 
in particular  the volumes and time to production ramp associated with new design wins depend on the adoption rate of new technologies in our customers end markets  especially in the communications networking sector 
program delays or cancellations could be more frequent during times of 
table of contents meaningful economic downturn 
should technologies such as voice over ip  ip multimedia subsystem  g and g wireless technologies  iptv  advanced multimedia applications  femtocell applications and other emerging technologies not be adopted as fast as we or our customers anticipate  actual volumes from new design wins may be lower than we are expecting  which could adversely affect our revenue growth and gross margin expectations 
our business depends on conditions in the communications networks and commercial systems markets 
demand in these markets can be cyclical and volatile  and any inability to sell products to these markets or forecast customer demand due to unfavorable or volatile market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and gross margin 
we derive our revenues from a number of diverse end markets  some of which are subject to significant cyclical changes in demand 
in  we derived and of our revenues from the communications networks and commercial systems markets  respectively 
in  we derived and of our revenues from the communications networks and commercial systems markets  respectively 
in  we derived and of our revenues from the communications networks and commercial systems markets  respectively 
we believe that our revenues will continue to be derived primarily from these two markets 
communications networks revenues include  but are not limited to  sales to alcatel lucent  avaya  bigband networks  british telecom  cisco systems  comverse  global crossing  huawei technologies co  ibm  ip access  italtel  kineto wireless  lg nortel  motorola  nanjing  nei end customer danaher  nokia siemens networks  pgi formerly premiere global  qwest  samsung  tellabs  tomen end customer nec  viasat  webex  west corporation  and zte 
commercial systems revenues include  but are not limited to  sales to aai textron  agilent technologies  arrow electronics  danaher  diebold  ge healthcare  hp  ibm  irobot  miltope  mindray  philips healthcare  and siemens medical 
generally  our products are building blocks for our customers products and  in certain instances  our customers are not the end users of our products 
if our customers experience adverse economic conditions in the end markets into which they sell our products  we would expect a significant reduction in spending by our customers 
some of these end markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change and economic uncertainty 
our exposure to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in customer demand in these end markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
we are expanding into applications either through new product development projects with our existing customers or through new customer relationships  but no assurance can be given that this strategy will be successful 
we forecast manufacturing needs based on customer demand 
changes in this demand could cause us or our contract manufacturers to hold excess or obsolete inventory that may not be salable to other customers on commercially reasonable terms  and which could require inventory valuation write downs that reduce our gross margin and profitability 
this risk is exacerbated by a current trend from our customers of requiring shorter lead times between placing orders with us and the shipment date 
that typically necessitates an increase in our inventory or inventory of our products at our contract manufacturers locations  raising the likelihood that upon cancellation or deferral  we may be holding greater amounts of inventory and or incurring additional costs 
additionally  we have adverse purchase commitment liabilities  which means we are contractually obligated to reimburse our contract manufacturers for the cost of excess inventory used in the manufacture of our products for which there is no forecasted or alternative use 
in addition  customer demand for our products is subject to significant fluctuation 
a prolonged economic downturn in the business or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a decline in our revenue  gross margin and overall profitability 
volatility and disruption of financial and credit markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and invest in network infrastructure and therefore could also reduce demand for our products and result in a decline revenue  gross margin and overall profitability 
if we overestimate demand  we may experience underutilized capacity and excess inventory levels 
as such  if we underestimate demand  we may miss sales opportunities and incur additional costs for labor overtime  equipment overuse and logistical complexities 
unexpected decreases in customer demand or our inability to accurately forecast customer demand could also result in increases in our adverse purchase commitment liability and have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

table of contents because of the limited number of direct and indirect suppliers  or in some cases  one supplier  for some of the components we and our contract manufacturers use  as well as the limited number of contract manufacturers who supply a majority of our products  a loss of a supplier  a decline in the quality of these components  a shortage of any of these components  or a loss or degradation in performance of a contract manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our business or our profitability 
there are only a limited number of direct and indirect suppliers  or in some cases  only one supplier  for a continuing supply of the components we and our contract manufacturers use in the manufacture of our products and any disruption in supply could adversely impact our financial performance 
for example  intel is the only indirect supplier of some microprocessors and other components used in our products 
we obtain these microprocessors and other components from resellers  integrators  component manufacturers and contract manufacturers 
alternative sources of components that are procured from one supplier or a limited number of suppliers could be difficult to locate and or would require a significant amount of time and resources to establish 
we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience difficulty obtaining adequate quantities of key components used in certain of our products  which have resulted and may result in delayed or lost sales 
in addition  current economic conditions expose us to an increased risk of vendor insolvency  which  given our reliance upon a limited supply base  could result in an inability to procure adequate quantities of materials and components to meet our customers demand and or ability to procure the quality of materials and components our customers require 
we have almost completed the transition to a fully outsourced model of manufacturing 
in  contract manufacturers provided approximately of all of our unit volume  most of which was attributable to foxconn and jabil 
furthermore  we intend to continue transferring manufacturing capabilities to our contract manufacturers in the future  and there is no guarantee that these transitions will be successful and timely 
in addition  if these third party manufacturers fail to adequately perform  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
among other things  inadequate performance by our contract manufacturers could include the production of products that do not meet our quality standards or schedule and delivery requirements and could cause us to manufacture products internally or seek additional sources of manufacturing 
additionally  if our contract manufacturers are responsible for a patent or copyright infringement including through the supply of counterfeit parts  we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies 
such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products  which would adversely affect our net sales of those products  and could affect our customer relationships more broadly 
in addition  alternative internal or external sources of manufacturing for our products could require significant time and resources to establish or transition 
we operate in intensely competitive industries  and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete 
we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments  changes in industry standards  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and improvements 
if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments  we may lose our competitive position  and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete 
similarly  if there are changes to technology requirements  it can render our products and technologies uncompetitive 
to compete successfully  we must maintain a successful r d effort  develop new products and production processes  and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors 
we may not be able to successfully develop and market these new products  the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers  and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect the demand for our products 
these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our profitability and financial condition  such as reducing our revenue  increasing our costs  lowering our gross margin  and requiring us to recognize and record impairments of our assets 

table of contents competition in the market for embedded systems is intense  and if we lose our market share  our revenues and profitability could decline 
we face competition in the design of embedded solutions from a number of sources 
our principal competition remains the internal design resources of our own customers 
many of our customers retain the ability to design embedded solutions in house 
in order to achieve design wins and receive subsequent orders from these customers  we must convince them of the benefits associated with using our design services and solutions rather than solutions designed by their in house personnel 
while we believe that many of our customers will increase the proportion of their solutions sourced from merchant suppliers  we will need to continue to demonstrate the benefits of our solutions relative to similar products that could be developed by our customers internal personnel in order to successfully execute our strategy 
in addition  consolidation of our customers can cause material changes in their use of third parties to realize new product designs 
we also compete with a number of companies and divisions of companies that focus on providing embedded solutions  including  but not limited to  advantech co  audiocodes  a division within emerson  a division within general electric company  hewlett packard  interphase  ibm  kontron ag  mercury computer systems  movius  and sun microsystems 
because the embedded systems market is growing  the market is attracting new non traditional competitors 
these non traditional competitors include contract manufacturers that provide design services and asian based original design manufacturers 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have a number of significant advantages over us  including a longer operating history  greater name recognition and marketing power  preferred vendor status with our existing and potential customers  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements  broader product and service offering to provide more complete and valued solutions  and lower cost structures which  among other things  could include different accounting principles relative to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
furthermore  existing or potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with each other or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
as a result of increased competition  we could encounter significant pricing pressures and or suffer losses in market share 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  many of the industries we serve  such as the communications industry  are encountering market consolidation  or are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future  which could result in increased pricing pressure and additional competition thus weakening our position or causing delays in new design wins and their associated production 

table of contents we have shifted our business from predominately perfect fit custom solutions to more standards based products  such as atca  ip media servers  and com express 
this required substantial expenditures for r d and if this strategy is not successful  our long term revenues  profitability and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we have shifted our business from predominately perfect fit or custom solutions  to more standards based solutions  such as atca  ip media server  and com express products 
we believe that over the next several years customers will continue to increasingly design their embedded computing platforms around standards based architectures and increasingly source embedded solutions from third party suppliers  such as radisys 
however  there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
in addition  the current state of the economy could further delay or prolong the transition or adoption of standards based products 
during  this strategy required us to make substantial expenditures for r d in new technologies  which were reflected as current expenses in our financial statements 
there is no assurance that these new products and technologies will be accepted by all of our customers and  if accepted  how large the market will be for these products or what the timing will be for any meaningful revenues 
customers may choose not to use standards based products to the extent  or in the timeframe that we are projecting 
if customers continue to use perfect fit architectures when designing their systems  we may not be well positioned to receive orders for such projects  or if we do receive such orders  they may not be profitable given our operational focus on standards based solutions 
if we are unable to successfully develop and sell standards based products to our customers  our revenues  profitability and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  if we successfully develop standards based products we may incur incremental r d expenses as we tailor the standards based products for our customers 
furthermore  we are building standards based products to meet industry standards that define the basis of compatibility in the operation and communication of a system supported by different vendors 
these standards constantly change and new competing standards emerge 
the development or adaptation of products and technologies requires us to commit financial resources  personnel and time significantly in advance of sales 
in order to compete  our decisions with respect to those commitments must accurately anticipate  sometimes two years or more in advance  both future demand and the technologies that will gain market acceptance to meet that demand 
if we are unable to accurately anticipate future demand and the technologies that will gain market acceptance  or appropriately allocate personnel and financial resources to meet such demand  our revenues  profitability and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
acquisitions and partnerships may be more costly or less profitable than anticipated and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
future acquisitions and partnerships may involve the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity or equity linked securities  issuances of debt and amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives 
moreover  to the extent that any proposed acquisition or strategic investment is not favorably received by shareholders  analysts and others in the investment community  the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  unanticipated liabilities  performance by the acquired business below our expectations  and issues with meeting the needs of acquired customers 

table of contents in the event that we make an acquisition or enter into a partnership and we are unable to successfully integrate operations  technologies  products or personnel that we acquire  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may expend additional resources without receiving a related benefit from strategic alliances with third parties 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur  restructuring and other charges  the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately 
from time to time  we have sought to optimize our operational capabilities and efficiencies and focus our efforts and expertise through business restructurings 
in the future we may decide to engage in discrete restructurings of our operations if business or economic conditions warrant 
possible adverse consequences related to such actions may include various charges for such items as idle capacity  disposition costs  severance costs  loss of propriety information and in house knowledge 
we may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to restructure our business  which may have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations expose us to additional political  economic and regulatory risks not faced by businesses that operate only in the united states 
in   and  as measured by delivery destination  we derived  and  respectively  of our revenues from canada and mexico   and  respectively  of our revenues from emea and  and  respectively  from asia pacific 
for the year ended december   approximately of our unit volume consisted of products manufactured by our asian contract manufacturing partners 
continuing this trend  during we continued to globally diversify our operations and began our transition to a fully outsourced manufacturing model 
as part of this plan we have begun to transfer our remaining internally manufactured products from our plant in hillsboro  oregon to lower cost manufacturing partners in asia 
as a result of all these activities  we are subject to worldwide economic and market conditions risks generally associated with global trade  such as fluctuating exchange rates  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest  wars and other acts of terrorism and changes in other economic conditions 
these risks  among others  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
additionally  some of our sales to overseas customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the us department of commerce 
protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or other countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance laws  trade restrictions resulting from war or terrorism  or other trade policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to manufacture in international markets 
additionally  us federal and state agency restrictions imposed by the buy american act or the trade agreement act may apply to our products manufactured outside the united states 
furthermore  revenues from outside the united states are subject to inherent risks  including the general economic and political conditions in each country 
as a result of the recent financial crisis and tightening of the credit markets  our customers and suppliers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit  which could impair our customers ability to make timely payments to us and could cause key suppliers to delay shipments and face serious risks of insolvency 
these risks  among others  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
our ability to procure contracts  maintain and increase revenues in foreign markets may be negatively impacted by increasing protectionism of foreign governments 
some foreign governments have come under increased pressure to protect their domestic economy and national security 
economic and security concerns have resulted in increasing protectionism that excludes foreign market participants from successfully procuring contracts and gaining sales in foreign markets 
as a result  our revenues could decrease and business and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable competitive advantage or be forced to endure costly litigation 
we are a technology dependent company  and our success depends on developing and protecting our intellectual property 
we rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property 
at the same time  our products are complex and are often not patentable in their entirety 
we also license intellectual property from third parties and rely on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
we cannot be certain that our actions will protect our proprietary rights 
any patents owned by us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  or if we are unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  some of our products are now designed  manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
despite the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property  this international exposure may reduce or limit protection of our intellectual property  which is more prone to design piracy outside of the united states 
third parties may also assert infringement claims against us in the future  assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation and we may not prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
changes to the inputs used to value our share based awards could adversely affect our operating results 
we are required to recognize the fair value of stock options and other share based payment compensation to employees as compensation expense in the statement of income 
option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility  expected life and forfeiture rate of such options 
we base our estimates on historical experience as well as other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of updating our assumptions 
accordingly  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates  which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
given the unpredictable nature and current significant volatility of the black scholes variables and other management assumptions such as number of options to be granted  underlying strike price and associated income tax impact  share based payment costs may differ from estimates as well as increase in future periods 
total share based compensation expense decreased for the year end december   as compared to the year ended december   however our stock price volatility has increased during the fourth quarter of  which along with unfavorable changes in the other assumptions used to value our share based payment arrangements could result in future increased compensation costs 
any such increase will be driven by significant fluctuations to the inputs used in applying our black scholes valuation model  which may have a material impact on our operating results 
decreased effectiveness of share based payment awards could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
we have historically used stock options and other forms of share based payment awards as key components of our total rewards employee compensation program in order to retain employees and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages 
we began recording charges to earnings for stock based compensation expense in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we have and will continue to incur increased compensation costs associated with our stock based compensation programs making it more expensive for us to grant share based payment awards to employees in the future 
like other companies  we have reviewed our equity compensation strategy in light of the current regulatory and competitive environment and have decided to reduce 
table of contents the total number of options granted to employees and the number of employees who receive share based payment awards 
due to this change in our stock based compensation strategy  we may find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business 
as of december   we had million outstanding stock options awarded to our employees with an average grant price of 
in addition  approximately of outstanding options were issued at a price above the closing price of our stock on december  if our stock price continues to decline  our stock option program will become ineffective as an incentive to retain key employees 
we rely on our key management and depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel  and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business 
a small number of key executives manage our business 
their departure could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  due to the specialized nature of our business  our future performance is highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and management personnel for our operations 
competition for personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
our failure to compete for these personnel could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if incentive programs we offer are not considered desirable by current and prospective employees  we could have difficulty retaining or recruiting qualified personnel 
if we are unable to recruit and retain key employees  our product development  and marketing and sales could be harmed 
as of december   we had million outstanding stock options awarded to our executive management team with an average grant price of 
as the average grant price of our outstanding options is greater than our current stock price  our stock option program may become less effective as an incentive to retain our current management team

these provisions authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without prior shareholder approval  which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock or common stock  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of shareholders to elect director candidates  and limit the ability of shareholders to take action by written consent  thereby effectively requiring all common shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our common shareholders 
in addition  if our common stock is acquired in specified transactions deemed to constitute control share acquisitions  provisions of oregon law condition the voting rights that would otherwise be associated with those common shares upon approval by our shareholders excluding  among other things  the acquirer in any such transaction 
provisions of oregon law also restrict  subject to specified exceptions  the ability of a person owning or more of our common stock to enter into any business combination transaction with us 
the foregoing provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and value of our convertible notes 
sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets  or the perception of such sales  could depress the market price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities in the public markets could depress the market price of our common stock  and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity related securities would have on the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes outstanding 
the price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity which we expect to occur involving our common stock 

table of contents the capped call transaction may affect the value of our common stock and any desired dilution mitigation will be limited to the extent that our stock price remains below per share 
the capped call transaction  which we entered into with a hedge counterparty in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes  is expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the capped call transaction  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the notes and is subject to certain adjustments similar to those contained in the convertible senior notes 
because the maximum number of shares deliverable under the capped call transaction is less than the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible senior notes  we refer to this effect as dilution mitigation 
if  however  the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction of per share  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  no additional shares would be delivered under the capped call transaction  and correspondingly  the dilution mitigation under the capped call transaction will be limited  which means that there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction 
in connection with hedging the capped call transaction  the hedge counterparty or its affiliates expect to purchase our common stock in the open market and or enter into various derivatives and or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock  and may enter into or unwind various derivatives and or purchase or sell our common stock in secondary market transactions 
these activities could have had the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the price of our common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the convertible senior notes and could have the effect of decreasing the price of our common stock during the period immediately prior to a conversion of the convertible senior notes 
the hedge counterparty or its affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions in relation to the capped call transaction from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling our common stock  other of our securities  or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging 
in addition  we intend to exercise options we hold under the capped call transaction whenever convertible senior notes are converted 
in order to unwind its hedge positions with respect to those exercised options  the counterparty or affiliates thereof expect to sell our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the period immediately prior to conversion of the convertible senior notes 
we have also agreed to indemnify the hedge counterparty and affiliates thereof for losses incurred in connection with a potential unwinding of their hedge positions under certain circumstances 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
for further information regarding the mechanics of our capped call transaction refer to our discussion in the liquidity and capital resources section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if the economic viability of our investment bank ubs ag deteriorates  we may incur permanent impairment charges which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings we currently hold investments in auction rate securities ars  the majority of which represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of government backed student loans with s p aaa or moody s aaa ratings at the time of purchase 
during the first quarter of  our portfolio of ars investments experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of 
table of contents purchase orders 
an auction failure  which is not a default in the underlying debt instrument  occurs when there are more sellers than buyers at a scheduled interest rate auction date and parties desiring to sell their auction rate securities are unable to do so 
during the fourth quarter of  we accepted a settlement offer from our investment bank  ubs ag  associated with the failed auctions 
under the terms of the offer  we have the right to require the bank to repurchase at par value our ars investments at any time between june  and june  as we plan to require ubs to repurchase our ars on june   these investments have been classified as short term investments 
for our ars settlement right  we have elected the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
we record our ars investments and corresponding settlement right at fair value in accordance with gaap for fair value measurements  using level inputs  as defined in note fair value of financial instruments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we considered various inputs to estimate the fair value of our ars investments at december   including the estimated time believed to allow the market for such investments to recover  projected estimates of future risk free rates  as well premiums designed to account for liquidity and credit risks associated with our ars holdings 
we determined the fair value of our ars settlement right based on the difference between the estimated fair value of the ars and the par value of the ars 
this difference was then discounted based on the future date when the settlement right is expected to be exercised to account for the time value of money 
the discount rate used took into consideration the risk free rate as well as ubs s credit quality 
the valuation of our ars settlement right is contingent upon the financial viability of our investment bank and accordingly  we have assigned a credit risk component based on market data available at the time of valuation 
however  if market conditions change and our investment bank is unable to fulfill its commitment  the realizable value of our ars settlement right would be adversely affected 
additionally  the inputs used in our valuation are based on managements estimates at the time of valuation and require significant judgment 
if any of these inputs vary or market conditions change significantly  actual results may differ and our overall financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
conversion of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders  including holders who have previously converted their convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes have a conversion price of equivalent to per share 
upon conversion of our convertible senior notes  some or all of the ownership interests of existing shareholders may be diluted 
although the capped call transaction is expected to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of our convertible senior notes  the conversion of our convertible senior notes could still have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the cap price of per share for the capped call 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the anticipated conversion of our convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
there are a number of trends and factors affecting our markets  including economic conditions in the united states  europe and globally  which are beyond our control 
these trends and factors may result in increasing upward pressure on the costs of products and an overall reduction in demand 
there are trends and factors affecting our markets and our sources of supply that are beyond our control and may negatively affect our cost of sales 
such trends and factors include adverse changes in the cost of raw commodities and increasing freight  energy  and labor costs in developing regions such as china 
our business strategy has been to provide customers with faster time to market and greater value solutions in order to help them compete in an industry that generally faces downward pricing pressure 
in addition  our competitors have in the past lowered  and may again in the future lower  prices in order to increase their market share  which would ultimately reduce the price we may realize from our customers 
if we are unable to realize prices that allow us to continue to compete on this basis of performance  our profit margin  market share  and overall financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected

dividend policy we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to declare cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
our ability to pay dividends is restricted by our policy as well as the covenants arising from our line of credit agreement with silicon valley bank

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of application ready software and hardware platforms for use in the communications  multi media  military aerospace and medical markets 
radisys innovative and market leading technologies help equipment manufacturers and network operators bring the most advanced products and services to market faster and more economically 
our product offerings include our media server products  atca products and commercial products 
we enable our customers to focus their resources and development efforts on their key areas of differentiation  while allowing them to provide higher value systems with a time to market advantage at a lower total cost 
financial results total revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
backlog was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within months 
the decrease in revenues during compared to was driven by decreased revenues in all of our product groups 
the increase in revenues during compared to was due to increases in revenues in the communications networks market of million along with increased revenues of million in the commercial systems market 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues were  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues was driven by favorable changes in our product mix  a reduction in the amortization of purchased technology  and lower charges incurred for warranty and excess and obsolete inventories 
the favorable change in our product mix resulted from a larger percentage of overall revenues coming from our higher margin next generation communications networks products 
amortization of purchased technology decreased by million during from this was driven by assets which have become fully amortized over the past two years  which accounted for million of the decrease  along with the extension of the useful lives of various intangible assets in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a decrease of million in amortization costs 
in addition  we incurred lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory primarily due to the continued realization of internal process improvements during during the year ended december   we also incurred in the first quarter a million charge associated with the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
we recognize deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence  including our projected three year us cumulative pre tax book loss and taxable loss  we concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against our us net deferred tax assets during net loss was million  million  million in  and  respectively 
net loss per share was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in net loss during from  was due primarily to the absence of goodwill impairment charges  which totaled million during this was offset by increased income tax provisions during driven primarily by the establishment of our deferred tax valuation allowance in the amount of million 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to operating cash flows in the amount of million and financing cash flows of million 
these positive cash flows were partially offset by cash outflows from investing activities in the amount of million 
investing cash outflows were driven by capital expenditures primarily related to upgrades and expansion of our internal infrastructure as well as costs due to our transition to a fully outsourced manufacturing model 
our investments  which include our ars settlement right  remained relatively consistent and totaled million at december  and 
table of contents million at december  decreases in our investments were driven by changes in the variables of our valuation model along with sales of ars during these decreases were almost fully offset by increases in the value of our ars settlement right during in the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  we intend to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation we record the inventory valuation allowance for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our inventory valuation allowances establish a new cost basis for inventory 
factors influencing the provision include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  regulatory requirements affecting components  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions for inventory reserves may be required 
our estimate for the allowance is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current provision for the inventory reserves may be inadequate 
additionally  we may incur additional expenses associated with any non cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer specific components 
adverse purchase commitments we are contractually obligated to reimburse our contract manufacturers for the cost of excess inventory used in the manufacture of our products  for which there is no alternative use 
excess inventory is defined as raw materials or assemblies components used in the manufacture of our products for which the contract manufacturers on hand and on order quantities are in excess of the requirements derived from our current product forecast of customer demand 
we are liable for excess inventory only to the extent that the contract manufacturer procures components to fulfill the manufacturing requirements as set forth in our current product forecast and agreed upon lead times and minimum order quantities 
unexpected decreases in customer demand or our inability to accurately forecast customer demand could result in increases in our adverse purchase commitment liability and have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
factors influencing the adverse 
table of contents purchase commitments liability include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  customer liability and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may incur additional expenses due to increases in our adverse purchase commitment liabilities 
our estimate for the adverse purchase commitments liabilities is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations to us 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current adverse purchase commitments liabilities may be inadequate 
estimates for adverse purchase commitments are derived from reports received on a quarterly basis from our contract manufacturers 
increases to this liability are charged to cost of goods sold 
when and if we take possession of inventory reserved for in this liability  the liability is transferred from other liabilities to our excess and obsolete inventory valuation allowance 
this liability  referred to as adverse purchase commitments  is provided for in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
accrued warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our standard product warranty terms generally include post sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time  which is generally months after shipment 
the workmanship of our products produced by contract manufacturers is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for a specified period of time ranging from to months 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates  internal repair costs  contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the contract manufacturer s warranty  average cost per call and current period product shipments 
if actual product failure rates  repair rates  service delivery costs  or post sales support costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
additionally  we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above 
accrued warranty reserves are included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
long lived assets our long lived assets include definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment 
the net balance of our definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment at december  amounted to million and million  respectively 
intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  primarily consist of acquired patents  completed technology  technology licenses  trade names and customer lists 
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  primarily consists of office equipment and software  manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements and other physical assets owned by us 
property and equipment are being depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from one to years 
we assess impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
conditions that would trigger a long lived asset impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if we determine that a long lived asset impairment assessment is required  we must determine the fair value of the asset  which is determined based on the associated value of estimated future cash flows 
we would estimate future cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to our business operations 
impairments would be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds this calculated fair value of the long lived assets 

table of contents considerable management judgment is required in determining if and when a condition would trigger an impairment assessment of our long lived assets and once such a determination has been made  considerable management judgment is required to determine the fair market value of the long lived asset 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period or if and when a condition has triggered an impairment analysis of our long lived assets  we may incur substantial impairment losses due to the write down or the write off of our long lived assets 
income taxes income tax accounting requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in our future tax returns 
to the extent that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we adjustment the valuation allowance accordingly 
the net deferred tax assets amounted to million as of december  we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
all future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated 
we record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
at december   of our accounts receivable was due from our largest customer 
if one of these large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay the amounts due to us  the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 
during the years ended december  and  there were no significant account balances reserved for and during the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by  as a result of the write off of previously specifically identified account balances 
we maintain a non specific bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events and historical experience 
typically  this non specific bad debt reserve amounts to approximately of quarterly revenues 
accrued restructuring and other charges because we have a history of paying severance benefits  expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable 
for leased facilities that were vacated and subleased  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of any future sublease income  was recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability 
table of contents to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by the following revenue recognition criteria an agreement with the customer  fixed pricing  transfer of title and risk of loss  and that the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  or for software  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we first allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
where the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined  we defer revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered or if support is the only undelivered element  revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the support 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions under which we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  infrequently we enter into agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
non standard terms and conditions can include  but are not limited to  customer acceptance criteria or other post delivery obligations 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
the components of total revenues were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  hardware software royalties and licenses software maintenance engineering and other services total revenues hardware under our standard terms and conditions of sale  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is shipped to the customer and revenue is recognized accordingly  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns for rotation rights as well as for price protection rights according to agreements with our distributors 
the amount of revenues derived from these distributors as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the software content included in hardware products such as our atca systems  certain mcpd products and cms solutions are considered to be more than incidental and our atca arrangements generally include multiple elements such as hardware  technical support services as well as specified software upgrades or enhancements 
as such  the revenue associated with these products is recognized in accordance with applicable software revenue recognition criteria 
software royalties and licenses revenue from customers for prepaid  non refundable software royalties is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for non prepaid royalties is recognized at the time the underlying product is shipped by the customer paying the royalty 
we recognize software license revenue at the time of 
table of contents shipment or upon delivery of the software provided all relevant revenue recognition criteria have been met and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we defer revenue on arrangements including specified software upgrades until the specified upgrade has been delivered 
software maintenance software maintenance services are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the terms of the contract 
the fair value of our post contract support has been determined by renewal rates within our support agreements as well as the actual amounts charged to customers for renewal of their support services 
engineering and other services engineering services revenue is recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
other services revenues include hardware repair services and custom software implementation projects 
hardware repair services revenues are recognized when the services are complete 
software implementation revenues are recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
deferred income deferred income represents amounts received or billed for the following types of transactions distributor sales certain sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor or return privileges and price protection rights terminate  at which time related estimated distributor resale revenue  estimated effects of distributor price adjustments  and estimated costs are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
our revenue reporting for these distributors is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues  deferred income on sales to distributors  and net income 
undelivered elements of an arrangement certain software sales include specified upgrades and enhancements to an existing product 
revenue for such products is deferred until the future obligation is fulfilled 
service sales certain sales are made for products and related service where the fair value of the service cannot be determined 
revenues for such sales are deferred until service obligations represent the only undelivered element  at which point revenues are recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
stock based compensation equity instruments are granted to employees  directors and consultants in certain instances  as defined in the respective plan agreements 
in   and  we issued stock options  restricted stock units under our stock plan and long term incentive plan ltip and stock under employee stock purchase plan espp 
we continue to use the black scholes model to measure the grant date fair value of stock options and espp shares 
the grant date fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is equal to the option vesting period  which is generally three years 
the 
table of contents grant date fair value of espp shares that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally months  subject to modification at the date of purchase due to the espp look back feature 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted under our stock plan and ltip is equal to the closing price of our shares as quoted on the nasdaq global select market on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock issued under our stock plan that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is three years 
the estimate of the number of options  espp shares  restricted stock unit awards issued under our stock plan expected to vest is determined based on historical experience 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock units issued under our ltip that are expected to vest is recognized ratably over the service period of the award 
the service period of restricted stock units issued under our ltip is equal to the period of time over which performance objectives underlying the awards are expected to be achieved 
the estimate of the number of restricted stock units  issued under our ltip  expected to vest is determined based upon our financial results as compared to the performance goals set for the award and is adjusted quarterly 
to determine the fair value of the stock options and espp shares  using the black scholes option pricing model  the calculation takes into consideration the effect of the following exercise price of the option or purchase price of the espp share  price of our common stock on the date of grant  expected term of the option or share  expected volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the option or share  risk free interest rate during the expected term of the option or share  and illiquidity associated with one year required holding period for espp shares 
the calculation includes several assumptions that require management s judgment 
the expected term of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises and represents a probability weighted average time period from grant until exercise of stock options  subject to information available at time of grant 
determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long term period and then considers the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
we also examined our historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations 
from this analysis  we identified three employee populations 
the expected term computation is based on historical vested option exercises and post vest forfeiture patterns 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option or share 
determining the appropriate fair value model and  as noted above  calculating the fair value of equity instruments associated with our employee benefit plans require the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these equity instruments represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 

table of contents the ltip performance awards are valued at the closing price of our common stock on the grant date which was on october  the corresponding compensation cost of each ltip award is expensed ratably over the measurement period of the award 
since the number of shares that may be issued under the ltip and the measurement period are both variable  we reevaluate the ltip awards on a quarterly basis and adjust the number of shares expected to be awarded based upon our financial results as compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to the number of shares awarded  and to the corresponding compensation expense  are made on a cumulative basis at the date of adjustment based upon the estimated probable number of shares to be awarded 
adjustments made to compensation expense resulting from a change in the estimated probable vesting date of the awards are made on a prospective basis 
for the year ended december   we recorded  in stock compensation expense associated with ltip awards 
on october   we announced an offer to exchange certain outstanding options for restricted stock units or new options 
eligible employees were permitted to exchange some or all of their outstanding options  with an exercise price greater than per share which is equal to the week high closing price of our common stock as of the start of this offer  that were granted on or before october   whether vested or unvested  for restricted stock units  except for employees in canada who received new stock options with new vesting schedules and exercise prices 
all employees of radisys and its subsidiaries  other than members of our board of directors  executive officers and employees located in the netherlands and israel were eligible to participate in the exchange offer  so long as they remain employed through the expiration date of the offer 
the option exchange took place on november  pursuant to the option exchange  eligible options were canceled and replaced with  restricted stock units and  stock options 
the new restricted stock units and stock options have a new three year vesting period that began on november  the exchange resulted in  in additional stock compensation expense which will be recognized over the new three year vesting period

all restructuring activities were completed during the first quarter of no charges associated with the second quarter restructuring plan were incurred during first quarter restructuring 
during the first quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan that included the elimination of positions 
the restructuring was initiated to align our costs with our annual operating plan 
during we incurred a total of million in restructuring charges  which were comprised almost entirely of employee payroll related severance costs 
included in these costs were charges related to the modification of equity awards to certain employees included in this restructuring activity 
we expect all activities associated with this restructuring to be completed by first quarter of second quarter restructuring 
during the second quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan that includes the elimination of positions and the relocation of eight employees as part of two strategic initiatives within manufacturing operations and engineering 
as part of the initiative  we plan to transition to a fully outsourced manufacturing model  which will transfer remaining manufacturing from our manufacturing plant in hillsboro  oregon to our manufacturing partners in asia 
the plan also includes consolidating our north american research and development positions and programs  and specifically transferring current projects from our design center in boca raton  florida  to other existing r d centers 
during we incurred a total of million in restructuring charges  which consisted of accrued severance obligations  healthcare benefits  relocation incentives and related payroll taxes

income tax provision we recorded tax expense and benefit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to a full valuation allowance provided against its us net deferred tax assets  revaluation of the canadian net deferred tax asset and canadian research and experimental development claims 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
in addition  we had valuation allowances of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
the million valuation at december  represents a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
the million valuation allowance at december  was related primarily to certain us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
based on our review of all positive and negative evidence  including a three year us cumulative pre tax loss and taxable loss  it was concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against our us net deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our foreign net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize all or a portion of the us net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance 
all future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  as of december  will be realized 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and ten foreign countries  and on occasion  we have been subject to corporate income tax audits 
specifically  we are currently under examination in the us and canada 
in determining the amount of income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions  we have evaluated whether certain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by taxing authorities 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may result from these examinations 
to the extent the ultimate outcome of the examinations differs from the amounts provided for as uncertain tax positions either additional expense or benefit will be recognized in the period in which the examinations are effectively settled 
in the fourth quarter of  the internal revenue service irs commenced its examination of the and years 
subsequent to december   the irs has issued and we have agreed to a notice of proposed adjustment 
the proposed adjustment was provided in full as an uncertain tax position at december   but did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

the capped call transaction provides for net share settlement in the event that the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock on the settlement date exceeds the strike price of approximately per share 
in such event  the hedge counterparty would deliver 
table of contents to us a number of shares equal to a formula determined by the quotient resulting from a the shares being settled times the difference between the volume weighted average price on the settlement date and the strike price of approximately per share  divided by b the volume weighted average price on the settlement date 
if the volume weighted average price on the settlement date equals or exceeds the cap price of per share  the difference in a would be minus  or 
because the maximum number of shares deliverable under the capped call transaction is less than the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible senior notes  we refer to this effect as dilution mitigation 
if the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction of  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  no additional shares would be delivered under the capped call transaction  and correspondingly  the dilution mitigation under the capped call transaction will be limited  which means that there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction 
although the capped call transaction covers approximately million shares  in order to facilitate an orderly settlement process  the shares are divided into tranches of approximately  shares each  settling on the twenty consecutive trading days prior to the date of maturity of our convertible notes 
thus  on each settlement date  approximately  shares would be settled  assuming a volume weighted average price on such settlement date of 
assuming volume weighted average price of  the hedge counterparty would deliver to us approximately  shares on each settlement date  calculated as follows  x we were advised by the hedge counterparty that  in order to hedge or manage its risk of having to deliver shares under the capped call transaction  depending on whether our stock price rises or falls  the counterparty may purchase our common stock in the open market or enter into derivative transactions equivalent to purchasing our stock in which case its derivative counterparty would be expected to purchase common stock or accomplish the equivalent in derivative transactions and or may sell our common stock  enter into derivative transactions equivalent to selling our stock or unwind that is  cancel upon payment of agreed consideration previous derivative transactions which would be the equivalent of selling our common stock 
these types of transactions are commonly referred to as modifying hedge positions 
such modifications to our counterparty s hedge positions may have an effect on our stock price 
as of december  and  we had outstanding convertible senior notes with a face value of million 
as of december  and  the fair value of our convertible senior notes was million and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes  with associated unamortized issuance costs of  we repurchased the notes in the open market for million and  as a result  recorded a net gain of million 
derivatives during  we began to enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange risks where natural hedging strategies could not be effectively employed 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the purpose of our hedging activities are to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets  liabilities and firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in general  our hedging activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose us to credit related losses in the event of non performance 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large financial institutions with high credit ratings 
all derivatives  including foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets and unrealized loss positions are recorded as other current liabilities 
changes in the fair values of the outstanding derivatives that are highly effective are 
table of contents recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged transaction 
typically  hedge ineffectiveness could result when the amount of our hedge contracts exceed our forecasted or actual transactions for which the hedge contracts were designed to hedge 
once a hedge contract matures the associated gain loss on the contract will remain in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income loss  at which time the gain loss will be recorded to the expense line item being hedged  which is primarily r d 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward foreign currency exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their nature  estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
if anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions change significantly  we would reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income loss to other income expense during the quarter in which the changes occur 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect of such on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
thereafter future minimum lease payments purchase obligations a foreign currency cash flow hedge contracts convertible senior notes interest on convertible senior notes total contractual obligations a purchase obligations include agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
these purchase obligations are entered into in the ordinary course of business and are expected to be funded by cash flows from continuing operations 
in addition to the above  as discussed in note income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have approximately million associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
these liabilities are primarily included as a component of other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as we do not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities  but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any activity involving special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
shelf registration statement on october   we filed an unallocated shelf registration statement on form s for the offering from time to time of up to million in securities consisting of common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  debt securities or units consisting of one or more of these securities 
the sec declared the shelf registration statement effective on november  except as may be stated in a prospectus supplement for any particular offering  we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities for general corporate purposes  which may include acquiring companies in our industry and related businesses  repaying existing debt  providing additional working capital and procuring capital assets 

table of contents on february   we offered and sold in a public offering pursuant to the shelf registration statement million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes  with an associated unamortized issuance costs of  we repurchased the notes in the open market for million and  as a result  recorded a net gain of million 
as such  we have million remaining capacity under this shelf registration statement 
liquidity outlook at december   our cash  cash equivalents and investments  net  amounted to million  of which million consisted of ars at fair value 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments  net  the cash generated from operations and our line of credit facilities will satisfy our short and long term expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  stock repurchases  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing business operations 
on june  we intend to exercise our right to require ubs to repurchase our ars investments for total gross proceeds of million 
the exercise of the settlement right will require us to pay off our line of credit with ubs  which is anticipated to require us to pay million 
this reduction in cash will be offset by ubs s payment to us in settlement of our ars investments and ars settlement right 
we believe the settlement of our ars investments and ars settlement right  offset by the pay off of our ubs line of credit  will result in a net improvement to our cash and cash equivalents of million 
if we were required to hold our ars until maturity  we believe we would still be able to satisfy our short and long term expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  stock repurchases  other liquidity requirements associated with our existing business operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could affect our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and those of high quality corporate issuers 
we attempt to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due to the short duration of most of the investment portfolios  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not necessarily have a direct impact on our earnings or cash flows 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected  to any significant degree  by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the securities portfolio 
the estimated fair value of our interest bearing investments at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the effect of an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies  namely  the canadian dollar  euro  chinese yuan  japanese yen  malaysian ringgit  british pound sterling  and new shekel 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely 
table of contents affected by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the balance sheets and income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during the consolidation process 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely affect overall expected profitability 
based on our policy  we have established a foreign currency exposure management program which uses derivative foreign exchange contracts to address nonfunctional currency exposures 
in order to reduce the potentially adverse effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we have entered into forward exchange contracts 
these hedging transactions limit our exposure to changes in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate  and as of december  the total notional or contractual value of the contracts we held was million 
these contracts will mature over the next months 
holding other variables constant  a adverse fluctuation  in relation to our hedge positions  of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would require an adjustment of million  reversing our hedge asset and creating a hedge liability as of december   in the amount of  a favorable fluctuation  in relation to our hedge positions  of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in an adjustment of million and increase our total hedge asset as of december   to million 
we do not expect a fluctuation to have any impact on our operating results as the underlying hedged transactions will move in an equal and opposite direction 
as of december  our hedged positions are associated with our exposure to movements in the canadian dollar 
if there is an unfavorable movement in the canadian dollar relative to our hedged positions this would be offset by reduced expenses  after conversion to the us dollar  associated with obligations paid for in the canadian dollar 
convertible notes 
the fair value of the convertible senior notes is sensitive to interest rate changes as well as changes in our stock price 
interest rate changes would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of the obligation 
fluctuations in our stock price would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes due to the value of the notes derived from the conversion feature 
unless we elect to repurchase our senior convertible notes in the open market  changes in the fair value of the senior convertible notes have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of the convertible senior notes was million at december
