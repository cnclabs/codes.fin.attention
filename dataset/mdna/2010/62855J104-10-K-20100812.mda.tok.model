item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading molecular diagnostics company focused on the development and marketing of novel predictive medicine  personalized medicine and prognostic medicine products 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies that help us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins may play in the onset  progression and treatment of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new molecular diagnostic products that are designed to assess an individual s risk for developing disease later in life predictive medicine  identify a patient s likelihood of responding to drug therapy and guide a patient s dosing to ensure optimal treatment personalized medicine  or assess a patient s risk of disease progression and disease recurrence prognostic medicine 
on june   we separated our main molecular diagnostic business from our research and drug development businesses by transferring our research and drug development businesses along with million of cash and marketable securities into our then wholly owned subsidiary  myriad pharmaceuticals  inc mpi 
all outstanding shares of mpi were then distributed to our stockholders as a pro rata  tax free dividend on june  by issuing one share of mpi common stock for every four shares of our common stock to stockholders of record on june  the separation resulted in mpi operating as an independent entity with its own publicly traded stock 
the results of operations for the former research and drug development activities conducted by us and by mpi until june  are included as part of this report for the periods prior to that date as discontinued operations 
we do not have any ownership in mpi subsequent to the separation 
mpi has recently changed its name to myrexis  inc during the fiscal year ended june   we devoted our resources to supporting our predictive medicine  personalized medicine and prognostic medicine products  as well as to the research and development of future molecular diagnostic candidates 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating segments 
our revenues consisted primarily of sales of molecular diagnostic products 
during the year ended june   we reported income from continuing operations before income tax of million and total net income of million 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred research and development expenses from continuing operations of million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
our research and development expenses include costs incurred in the development  maintenance and improvement of our eight current molecular diagnostic product offerings bracanalysis  colaris  colaris ap  melaris  theraguide fu  ondose  prezeon and prolaris and for costs incurred for the discovery  development and validation of other molecular diagnostic product candidates 
our sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses include costs associated with building our molecular diagnostic business 
we expect that these costs will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  share based payment expense  and income taxes revenue recognition 
revenue includes the sale of molecular diagnostic products for our predictive  personalized and prognostic medicine products  and is recorded at the invoiced amount net of any discounts or allowances 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the test  communication of results  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our molecular diagnostic products  which are recorded net of any discounts or contractual allowances 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge or credit to expense when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could materially affect our results of operations or financial position  however  to date these changes have not been material 
it is possible that we may need to adjust our estimates in future periods 
after a review of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of june  and  we have determined that a hypothetical ten percent increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts would result in additional bad debt expense and an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
share based payment expense 
we recognize share based equity compensation in our consolidated statements of operations at the grant date fair value of our stock options and other equity based compensation 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material increases to the valuation of options granted in future periods and increases in the expense recognized for share based payments 
income taxes 
our income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the liability method in accordance with accounting standards codification asc income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  or the expected results from any future tax examinations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future provision for income taxes 
those factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  the results of any future tax examinations  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  past levels of r d spending  acquisitions  changes in our corporate structure  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes all of which may result in periodic revisions to our provision for income taxes 
developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate and analysis of potential uncertain tax positions  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated valuation allowance we deem necessary to offset deferred tax assets 
during the fiscal year ended june   we determined that a valuation allowance was not required for our deferred tax assets because we have established a sufficient history of taxable income from operations 
however  if we do not maintain taxable income from operations in future periods  we may increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and record material adjustments to our income tax expense 
our judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our uncertain income tax positions in our consolidate financial statements  adverse determination by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
interest and penalties on income tax items are included as a component of overall income tax expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements including transfers in and out of levels and and a higher level of disaggregation for the different types of financial instruments 
for the reconciliation of level fair value measurements  information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements are presented separately 
this standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  with the exception of revised level disclosure requirements which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  comparative disclosures are not required in the year of adoption 
we adopted the provisions of the standard on january   which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations years ended june  and revenue is comprised primarily of sales of our molecular diagnostic products 
revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
sales of bracanalysis account for most of our revenues 
this increase in revenue is primarily attributable to increased testing volume 
increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and patients and increased testing volumes for the fiscal year ended june  we are currently in the process of expanding our sales force  executing a public awareness campaign and increasing our market penetration in the us ob gyn market 
through these and other efforts we are attempting to broaden utilization of bracanalysis with current physician customers and increase the number of new physician customers prescribing our products 
we believe these efforts may allow us to continue to grow molecular diagnostic revenue in future periods  however  the markets in which we operate are still experiencing high unemployment  reduced physician office visits  higher health insurance deductibles  and other economic challenges 
we believe that there continues to be a negative impact on our revenue growth due to these difficult economic conditions 
in addition  because bracanalysis and most of our molecular diagnostic products are only utilized once per patient  we will need to sell our services through physicians to new patients or develop new molecular diagnostic products in order to continue to generate revenue 
therefore  there can be no assurance that molecular diagnostic revenue will continue to increase at historical rates or at all 
cost of revenue is comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  royalty payments  equipment costs and facilities expense 
cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this modest increase in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
there can be no assurance that molecular diagnostic gross profit margins will continue to increase and we expect that our gross profit margins will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the introduction of new products as well as new technologies and operating systems in our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
research and development expenses from continuing operations are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  and equipment and facility costs 
research and development expenses for continuing operations incurred during the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to increased research and development costs associated with clinical studies to support our existing molecular diagnostic products  internal molecular diagnostic product discovery and development and clinical studies undertaken to support our existing products and the launch of new products 
we expect our research and development expenses will increase over the next several years as we work to develop our product pipeline and expand our offerings of molecular diagnostic products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for continuing operations consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  customer service  billing and collections  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing expense of approximately million to support the continued expansion of our ob gyn sales  dtc campaign in strategic southern and midwestern states  and other marketing initiatives  increased share based payment expense of approximately million  an increase of million in bad debt expense associated with increase in molecular diagnostic sales  and general increase in administrative costs of approximately million to support the growth in our revenues 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate depending on the number and scope of any new product launches and efforts in support of our existing molecular diagnostic products 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates during the period  the repurchase of approximately million of myriad common stock  and the contribution of approximately million of cash and marketable securities to mpi on june  other income for the fiscal year ended june  changed million from an expense of million for the fiscal year ended june  to million income for the fiscal year ended june  the change was due to an other than temporary impairment on marketable investment securities from our holding of lehman brothers holdings  inc lehman bonds recorded in fiscal due to lehman s bankruptcy filing in fiscal we determined that our investment in certain lehman bonds was impaired 
the income tax benefit of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  represents the reversal in full of our valuation allowance previously offsetting our deferred tax assets that was netted against our alternative miniumum tax and state tax expense see note in the consolidated financial statements 
years ended june  and revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
sales of bracanalysis account for most of our revenues 
this increase in revenue is primarily attributable to increased testing volume 
increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and patients and increased testing volumes for the fiscal year ended june  cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
research and development expenses for continuing operations incurred during the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease of was primarily due to decreased expenses associated with internal research projects of approximately million offset by an increase in share based payment expense of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing expense of approximately million to support the growth in our revenues  which included the continued expansion of our oncology and ob gyn sales force and our direct to consumer marketing campaign in florida and texas  general increases in administrative support and facility expenses of approximately million to support growth in molecular diagnostic sales and market expansion efforts  general increases in sales support costs of approximately million to support growth in our molecular diagnostic business  an increase of million in bad debt expense associated with increased molecular diagnostic sales  increased share based payment expense of approximately million 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was due primarily to lower market interest rates during the fiscal year 
other expense for the fiscal year ended june  increased million from an expense of million for the fiscal year ended june  to million expense for the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily attributed to due to an other than temporary impairment in on marketable investment securities from our holding of lehman 
due to lehman s bankruptcy filing in we determined that our investment in certain lehman bonds was impaired 
as noted above under overview  on june   we separated the research and drug development businesses conducted by us and by mpi and spun off mpi to our stockholders 
we do not have any ownership or other form of interest in mpi subsequent to the separation 
as a result of the separation  we have classified the operations from the research and drug development businesses that were conducted by us and mpi until june  as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended june   losses from discontinued operations increased by million  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to the lack of the one time million non refundable upfront fee recognized in the year ended june  related to the co marketing agreement with h 
lundbeck a s for our former alzheimer s disease program that partially offset our drug development costs 
on june   we discontinued our alzheimers disease program 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities increased million  or  from million at june  to million at june  this increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from sales of our molecular diagnostic products 
this increase was partially offset by expenditures for our internal research and development programs  purchase of capital assets  sales and marketing expense for our molecular diagnostic products  our share repurchase program and other expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
net trade receivables increased million excluding bad debt write offs reserves between june  and june   primarily due to the increase in product sales during the same period 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by million between june  and june   primarily due to payments made from our accounts payable related to our discontinued operations following the spin off of our former research and drug development businesses to mpi on june  our investing activities used cash of million  million and million during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities from the prior fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable investment securities during the year 
for the fiscal year ended june   purchases of marketable investment securities used cash of million  maturities and sales of marketable investment securities provided cash of million  and capital expenditures for research equipment used cash of million 
financing activities used cash of million  million during the fiscal year ended june  and and provided cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  cash utilized from financing activities in was primarily due to the purchase of million of our common stock through a share repurchase program 
the cash used in the share purchase was offset by cash provided by the exercise of stock options and sales of our shares under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
we believe that with our existing capital resources and expected net cash to be generated from sales of our molecular diagnostic products  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time and we may need or want to raise additional financing within this period of time 
our future capital requirements  cash flows  and results of operations could be affected by and will depend on many factors that are currently unknown to us  including failure to sustain revenue growth or margins in our molecular diagnostic business  termination of the licenses underlying our molecular diagnostic products or failure to enter into product or technology licensing or other arrangements favorable to us  delays or other problems with operating our laboratory facilities  the costs and expenses incurred in supporting our existing molecular diagnostic products  the progress  results and cost of developing and launching additional molecular diagnostic products for our molecular diagnostic business  the costs  timing  outcome  and enforcement of any regulatory review of our existing or future molecular diagnostic products  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications  maintaining and enforcing our issued patents and defending intellectual property related claims  the costs  timing and outcome of any litigation against us  the introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors  changes in intellectual property laws of our patents or enforcement in the united states and foreign countries  changes in the governmental or private insurers reimbursement levels for our products  changes in structure of the healthcare system or healthcare payment systems  and the impact of current economic conditions and job loss resulting in fewer doctor visits and loss of employer provided insurance coverage

certain factors that may affect future results of operations the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this annual report on form k contains such forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as may  anticipate  estimate  expects  projects  intends  plans  believes and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance  identify forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are management s present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward looking statements 
these risks include  but are not limited to the risk that sales and profit margins of our existing molecular diagnostic products may decline or will not continue to increase at historical rates  the risk that we may be unable to develop additional molecular diagnostic products  the risk that licenses to the technology underlying our molecular diagnostic products and any future products are terminated or cannot be maintained on satisfactory terms  risks related to delays or other problems with operating our laboratory testing facilities  risks related to public concern over our products  risks related to regulatory developments or enforcement in the united states and foreign countries and changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems  uncertainties about our ability to obtain new corporate collaborations and acquire new technologies on satisfactory terms  if at all  the development of competing products and services  the risk that we or our licensors may be unable to protect the proprietary technologies underlying our products  the risk of patent infringement claims  risks of new  changing and competitive technologies and regulations in the united states and internationally  and other factors discussed under the heading risk factors contained in item a of this annual report 
in light of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the results and events discussed in the forward looking statements contained in this annual report or in any document incorporated by reference might not occur

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our written investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
although our investment policy guidelines are intended to ensure the preservation of principal  current market conditions have resulted in high levels of uncertainty 
our ability to trade or redeem the marketable investment securities in which we invest  including certain corporate bonds and auction rate securities  has become difficult 
valuation and pricing of these securities has also become variable and subject to uncertainty 
as of june  we have net unrealized gains of million in our investment portfolio 
for the year ended june  we have experienced fluctuations in our portfolio value primarily from our investments in bonds of financial institutions 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates by basis points would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks
