critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experiences  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience  and the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectability of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection 
sale of sba loans the company has the ability and the intent to sell all or a portion of certain sba loans in the loan portfolio and  as such  carries the saleable portion of these loans at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value 
at december  and december   the fair value of sba loans exceeded aggregate cost and therefore  sba loans were carried at aggregate cost 
in calculating gain on the sale of sba loans  the bank performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portions of the loan 
the company assumptions are validated by reference to external market information 
available for sale securities the fair value of most securities classified as available for sale is based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
supplemental employee retirement plan the company has entered into supplemental employee retirement agreements with certain executive and senior officers 
the measurement of the liability under these agreements includes estimates involving life expectancy  length of time before retirement  and expected benefit levels 
should these estimates prove materially wrong  we could incur additional or reduced expense to provide the benefits 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has sufficient taxable income from current and prior periods to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
as such  we have provided no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
operating results for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss available to common shareholders of million or basic and diluted earnings per share  compared with a net loss of million or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  and net income of million or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the net loss available to common shareholders for was reduced by preferred dividends of million 
there were no preferred dividends during and the increase in earnings during compared to resulted primarily from a decrease in provision for credit losses 
the decrease in earnings during compared to resulted primarily from an increase of million for the provision for loan losses  offset  in part  by a decrease in the provision for income taxes of million 
see the specific sections below for details regarding these changes 
net interest income and margin net interest income is the principal source of the company s operating earnings 
net interest income is affected by changes in the nature and volume of earning assets held during the year  the rates earned on such assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

interest differential is affected by changes in volume  changes in rates and a combination of changes in volume and rates 
volume changes are caused by changes in the levels of average earning assets and average interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
rate changes result from changes in yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities 
changes not solely attributable to volume or rates have been allocated to the rate component

the decrease of million in net interest income in was primarily due to a decrease of million in interest income offset  in part  by a decrease of million in interest expense 
the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  and for the decline in net interest margin in was primarily the result of a decrease in short term interest rates  a decrease in income from interest rate swaps  an increase in nonperforming loans  and decreased balance sheet leverage 
during the year ended december   the net settlement from interest rate swaps contributed million to support net interest income compared to million for the year ended december  nonperforming loans had a negative impact on net interest margin of approximately of basis points in compared to basis points in the decline in net interest margin in compared to was primarily the result of growth in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities and decreased balance sheet leverage 
average loans represented of average earning assets in compared to in and in in addition  in the bank s ratio of average loans to average deposits was down from in and in  reflecting slightly faster deposit funding relative to loan growth during the year 
net interest income is the principal source of the company s operating earnings 
significant factors affecting net interest income are rates  volumes and mix of the loan  investment and deposit portfolios and changes in short term interest rates 
the interest rate earned on a majority of the company s assets  specifically the loan portfolio  adjust with changes in short term market rates 
as such  the nature of the company s balance sheet is that  over time as short term interest rates change  income on interest earning assets has a greater impact on net interest income than interest paid on liabilities 
the company s prime rate averaged   and for the years ended   and  respectively 
interest income for the year ended december   the company reported interest income of million  a decrease of million or over million reported in the decrease in interest income primarily reflects a decrease in short term interest rates  a decrease in income from interest rate swaps  and an increase in nonperforming assets

the allowance is reduced by charge offs and increased by provisions for credit losses charged to operating expense and recoveries of previously charged off loans 
based on management s evaluation of such risks  additions of million  million  and million were made to the allowance for credit losses in  and  respectively 
the significant increase in provision for came in response to increased risk posed by significant deterioration in real estate values and economic conditions generally  in addition to charge offs taken on specifically identified exposures in real estate loans 
during  the bank had million in charge offs  primarily due to the significant decrease in value of collateral securing real estate loans  and had recoveries of million as compared to million in charge offs and  in recoveries in and million in charge offs and  in recoveries in the allowance for credit losses was million representing of total loans at december  as compared to million representing of total loans at december  and million representing of total loans at december  management is of the opinion that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level adequate for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  the bank s loan portfolio  which includes approximately million in real estate loans  representing approximately of the portfolio  could be adversely affected if california economic conditions continue to contract and the real estate market in the bank s market area were to further weaken 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of non performing loans and other real estate owned oreo and the level of the allowance for loan losses  which could adversely affect the bank s future growth and profitability

at december  and  the fair value of sba loans exceeded aggregate cost and therefore  sba loans were carried at aggregate cost 
other loans consist primarily of loans to individuals for personal uses  such as installment purchases  overdraft protection loans and a variety of other consumer purposes 
at december   other loans totaled million as compared to million at december  allowance for loan losses a consequence of lending activities is the potential for loss 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions  rising interest rates and the financial experience of the borrowers 
the allowance for loan losses  which provides for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process  is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and decreased by the amount of charge offs net of recoveries 
there is no precise method of estimating specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the level of the related provision for loan losses are determined in management s judgment based on consideration of economic conditions borrowers financial condition loan impairment evaluation of industry trends historic losses  migrations and delinquency trends industry and other concentrations loans which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management continuing evaluation of the performing loan portfolio periodic review and evaluation of problem loans off balance sheet risks assessments by regulators and other third parties in addition to the internal assessment of the loan portfolio  the bank also retains a consultant who performs credit reviews on a regular basis and then provides an assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the federal banking regulators also conduct examinations of the loan portfolio periodically

based on an evaluation of the individual credits  historical credit loss experienced by loan type and economic conditions  management has allocated the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans at december of the previous five years as follows dollars in thousands as of december  commercial and other real estate other real estate construction land loans factoring asset based lending sba other commercial and other real estate other real estate construction land loans factoring asset based lending sba other beginning in the second quarter of  deterioration in economic conditions within the company s market area and  as applicable  the state of california and or national macroeconomic conditions resulted in increased stress to the loan portfolio  specifically construction and land development loans outside of the company s primary market of santa clara county and contiguous portions of san mateo and alameda counties 
in response to the deteriorating market conditions  the company undertook steps to aggressively reduce the exposure to construction and land development loans with particular emphasis on loans outside of its primary market 
management curtailed new loan origination  thoroughly reviewed collateral values of projects approaching maturity and conservatively evaluated the market prospects of collateral for indications of impairments 
at december   the company s land development portfolio was reduced to million with just million remaining exposure outside of the primary market area 
further  over of the remaining loans in this category are underwritten to amortizing term structures supported by cash flow from liquidity of the borrowers 
construction loans at december  were reduced to million with million remaining on projects outside of the primary market area 
in addition  at that date million  or  were loans to finance commercial projects and million  or were loans to finance residential projects of five or more units 
the aggressive management of credits in this category has resulted in elevated levels of nonperforming assets as loans are placed on nonaccrual through the marketing phase of the underlying project 
in addition  loans placed on nonaccrual have been reduced to the level of indicated impairments 
this has resulted in an elevated level of charge offs 
management believes that this practice results in a recorded level of nonperforming assets that generally has been reduced to a net liquidation value  and as these assets are liquidated do not expect to incur additional significant losses 
non performing loans at december   on average  have been reduced by approximately of the remaining contractual balance  which was taken as a charge off against the allowance for loan losses 
in response to the elevated level of charge offs  migration of construction and land portfolios  and general deterioration in economic conditions the company also increased provisions for potential loans losses and built the reserve to approximately of total loans 
the coverage ratio  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at december  management believes that the coverage ratio reflects the conservative charge off practice and that the allowance is adequate for losses not specifically identified in impairment analyses 
at december  nonperforming assets represented of total assets  compared to of total assets on december  nonperforming assets have increased primarily as a result of substantial deterioration in the real estate market and the company s commitment to aggressively manage credit exposure 
the following summarizes nonperforming assets at december      and as of december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis loans with principal or interest contracturally past due days or more nonperforming loans other real estate owned at december   there were three loans totaling million that were restructured and in compliance with modified terms 
these loans were considered performing loans and  as such  were accruing interest as of december  there were no loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms as of december  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectability of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection 
there were twenty four non accrual loans representing twenty two relationships totaling million at december  as compared to sixteen non accrual loans totaling million at december  and four non accrual loans at december  totaling million 
nonperforming loans have increased primarily as a result of substantial deterioration in the real estate market

in addition to regular interaction with the company s borrowers  the relationship managers review the credit ratings for each loan on a monthly basis and identify any potential downgrades 
for commercial  sba  and factoring asset based loans  the company receives quarterly financial statements and other pertinent reporting  such as borrowing bases for asset based facilities  so as to identify any deteriorating financial trends 
covenant compliance for these loans is also monitored on a quarterly basis 
for real estate construction and land loans  the development  construction and lease up or sell out status of each project is monitored on a monthly basis 
for loans secured by standing commercial or residential property  the company receives updated rent rolls and operating statements on an annual basis 
in addition  home equity loans are reviewed annually for deterioration in either the underlying property value or the borrower s payment history 
management also engages a third party loan review firm that reviews the loan portfolio every four months to further identify potential problem loans 
the loan review includes assessment of underwriting  quality of legal documents  management of the loan relationship  and adherence to the credit policy along with acceptable risk mitigation and rationale for exceptions to the policy 
as part of the loan approval process  management identifies the nature and type of underlying collateral supporting individual loans 
prior to or at the time of initial advances  any required lien positions are verified using ucc lien searches for personal property collateral  or title insurance for real property collateral 
the company engages a third party loan review firm to conduct an annual review of its loan documentation and the related policies and procedures regarding the loan documentation process 
the company primarily relies on fair market appraisals to determine the value of underlying collateral 
appraisals are required for real property secured loans of  or more  including increases to existing loans of  or more 
in the event there is evidence of deterioration in values  an evaluation of the collateral value and or a full new appraisal is required for an extension of the loan maturity 
potential problem loans are reappraised at a minimum of every months depending on current economic conditions 
the appraisals are performed by board approved appraisers that have appropriate licensing and experience 
when a prospective loan amount exceeds million  the completed appraisal is further reviewed by a qualified third party review appraiser 
to determine the value of underlying collateral for formula lines of credit that are predicated on a borrowing base of eligible assets  the company requires a pre loan funding field audit of the borrower s financial records to verify the accounts receivable  their eligibility for inclusion in the borrowing base  performance of the collateral and any asset concentrations 
on a monthly basis  relationship managers assess the collateral position of individual loans and identify any potential collateral shortfalls which  if left uncorrected  could result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan at some future date 
any potential collateral shortfalls are incorporated into a written corrective action plan 
the status of the correction action plans are reviewed by executive management 
review of ability to acquire additional collateral and the related timeframes are addressed on an individual loan basis 
at the time a loan is classified as substandard which includes any loans on non accrual  the company performs an impairment analysis of the collateral based on appraisals  field audits  other market value indicators  and management s judgment 
any shortfall between the collateral s realization value and the loan balance is charged off at that time 
impairment analyses are updated on a monthly basis 
additionally  as underlying collateral is reappraised the value of the collateral is reassessed and any additional charge off is taken at that time 
a similar practice is followed for downward adjustments to the company s oreo carrying value 
management is of the opinion that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level adequate for known and unidentified losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  the company s construction and land loan portfolios  representing approximately of the total loan portfolio  could be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company s market area were to weaken 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of non performing loans and other real estate owned and the level of the allowance for loan losses  which could adversely affect the company s future growth and profitability 
funding deposits represent the bank s principal source of funds 
most of the bank s deposits are obtained from professionals  small to medium sized businesses and individuals within the bank s market area 
the bank s deposit base consists of non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
the following table summarizes the composition of deposits as of december   and dollars in thousands as of december  amount percent amount percent amount percent noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand money market and savings certificates of deposit less than and more total deposit portfolio deposits decreased million or from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in deposits was primarily in money market and savings  and certificates of deposit less than  leverage total gross loan balances at december  were million 
the resulting loan to deposit ratio was 
other earning assets at december  were primarily comprised of investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits of million 
to date  the company has deployed other earning assets primarily in federal funds sold to address the potential volatility of deposit balances and to accommodate projected loan funding  and in short term fixed rate investments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the company s asset sensitive balance sheet 
when deploying other earning assets  the company implements strategic decisions that may have a beneficial or adverse impact on net interest income and on the net interest margin to manage the business through a variety of economic cycles 
during the fourth quarter of and throughout  as part of a strategic decision the company effectively repositioned the composition of its balance sheet and improved its liquidity position by deploying other earning assets primarily in federal funds in direct response to the recent economic downturn and potential volatility of the deposit portfolio 
capital resources the company s capital resources consist of shareholders equity  trust preferred securities and for regulatory purposes the allowance for credit losses subject to limitations 
at december   the company s capital resources decreased million to million from million at december  tier capital decreased million to million primarily due to net income 
tier capital decreased  primarily due to the decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the company and the bank are subject to the capital guidelines and regulations governing capital adequacy for bank holding companies and national banks 
additional capital requirements may be imposed on banks based on market risk 
the fdic requires a leverage ratio of for new banks during the first three years of operation 
after the first three years of operations  the comptroller requires a minimum leverage ratio of for national banks that have received the highest composite regulatory rating a regulatory measurement of capital  assets  management  earnings and liquidity and that are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum 
the comptroller s regulations also require national banks to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  including both on and off balance sheet exposures  which are multiplied by certain risk weights assigned by the comptroller to those assets 
at least one half of the qualifying capital must be in the form of tier capital 
the risk based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories of credit risk  and might not take into account many other factors that can affect a bank s financial condition 
these factors include overall interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  concentrations of credit risk  certain risks arising from nontraditional activities  the quality of loans and investments  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control financial and operating risks  including the risk presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities 
the comptroller has addressed many of these areas in related rule making proposals 
in addition to evaluating capital ratios  an overall assessment of capital adequacy must take account of each of these other factors including  in particular  the level and severity of problem and adversely classified assets 
for this reason  the final supervisory judgment on a bank s capital adequacy may differ significantly from the conclusions that might be drawn solely from the absolute level of the company s risk based capital ratio 
the comptroller has stated that banks generally are expected to operate above the minimum risk based capital ratio 
banks contemplating significant expansion plans  as well as those institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk  should hold capital consistent with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed 
further  the banking agencies have adopted modifications to the risk based capital regulations to include standards for interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and equity capital arising from movements in interest rates 
while interest rate risk is inherent in a bank s role as financial intermediary  it introduces volatility to bank earnings and to the economic value of the company 
the banking agencies have addressed this problem by implementing changes to the capital standards to include a bank s exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates as a factor that the banking agencies consider in evaluating an institution s capital adequacy 
bank examiners consider a bank s historical financial performance and its earnings exposure to interest rate movements as well as qualitative factors such as the adequacy of a bank s internal interest rate risk management 
finally  institutions with significant trading activities must measure and hold capital for exposure to general market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and exposure to specific risk associated with debt and equity positions in the trading portfolio 
general market risk refers to changes in the market value of on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items resulting from broad market movements 
specific market risk refers to changes in the market value of individual positions due to factors other than broad market movements and includes such risks as the credit risk of an instrument s issuer 
the additional capital requirements apply effective january  to institutions with trading assets and liabilities equal to or more of total assets or trading activity of billion or more 
the federal banking agencies may apply the market risk regulations on a case by case basis to institutions not meeting the eligibility criteria if necessary for safety and soundness reasons 
in connection with the recent regulatory attention to market risk and interest rate risk  the federal banking agencies will evaluate an institution in its periodic examination on the degree to which changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices can affect a financial institution s earnings or capital 
in addition  the agencies focus in the examination on an institution s ability to monitor and manage its market risk  and will provide management with a clearer and more focused indication of supervisory concerns in this area 
under certain circumstances  the comptroller may determine that the capital ratios for a national bank shall be maintained at levels  which are higher than the minimum levels required by the guidelines 
a national bank which does not achieve and maintain adequate capital levels as required may be subject to supervisory action by the comptroller through the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels 
in addition  the company is required to meet certain guidelines of the comptroller concerning the maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses 
in response to increasing risk perceived in the economic environment  during the fourth quarter of the company raised million of additional capital 
the following is a summary of these issuances private placement on december   investors agreed to purchase million of the company s series b and b mandatorily convertible cumulative perpetual preferred stock in a private placement  subject to the united states department of the treasury approving our participation in the tarp capital purchase program see discussion below and the company satisfying all legal requirements for selling equity securities to the treasury under the program

the series b and series b shares collectively the shares accrue dividends at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly 
the holders of the series b and b preferred shares have voting rights at a rate of votes per share and may convert their shares in to shares of the company s common stock at a conversion rate of per share  subject to customary adjustments for splits  dividends and other similar transactions 
each series b and b preferred share shall automatically convert to common stock after the later of months or such time that shareholder and regulatory approvals  to the extent required for conversion  are received mandatory conversion date 
if the average closing price of the company s common stock does not equal or exceed per share over the consecutive trading days immediately prior to the mandatory conversion date the current market price condition  such date will be extended for successive six month periods until the current market price condition is met 
the company can force conversion of the shares into common stock on or after january  through september   if a the company fully pays the accrued dividends and prepays the dividends that would have accrued up through september   b the company s shareholders have approved the conversion and c the current market price condition is met 
subsequent to september   the company can force conversion of the shares into common stock if the above three conditions are met  with the only exception being the necessity to pay all dividends accrued through the date of conversion as opposed to prepaying any such amount 
troubled assets relief program tarp on november   the united states department of the treasury the treasury approved the company s participation in the tarp capital purchase program  subject to the company raising additional equity in an amount satisfactory to the treasury 
on december   investors agreed to purchase million of the company s series b and b mandatorily convertible cumulative perpetual preferred stock in a private placement see discussion above  subject to the treasury approving the company s participation in the tarp capital purchase program and its ability to satisfy all legal requirements for selling equity securities to the treasury under the program 
based on discussions with the treasury representatives  the company understood that raising million would satisfy the requirement of the company raising additional equity 
on december   the company issued  shares of its fixed rate cumulative perpetual series c preferred stock  having a liquidation value of  to the treasury 
dividends accrue at the rate of per annum for the first five years and then per annum thereafter 
the dividends will be paid only as declared by the board of directors of the company 
however  in the event such dividends have not been paid for six or more quarters  whether or not consecutive  the holders of the series c preferred shares will have the right to elect two members to the company s board of directors 
in addition the company issued a warrant to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at a purchase price of per share  subject to certain adjustment provisions such as stock splits  issuances of common stock at or below a specified price relative to the then current market price of the stock  and other provisions 
the warrant expires ten years from the issuance date 
the warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time except that the treasury may not exercise more than one half of the shares underlying the warrant prior to the earlier of i december  or ii the date on which the company receives gross proceeds of not less than  in one or more qualified equity offerings 
in addition  the treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrant 
prior to december   unless the company has redeemed the series c preferred shares or the treasury has transferred the series c preferred shares to a third party  consent of the treasury will be required for the company to pay any dividend or other distribution to the holders of the common stock or redeem  purchase or acquire any shares of common stock or other equity securities other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practices 
in addition  the company s ability to declare common dividends or repurchase common stock or other equity securities will be subject to restrictions in the event the company fails to declare and pay  or set aside for payment  the full amount of dividends on the series c preferred shares 
finally  the company has agreed  so long as the treasury holds any securities of the company  to ensure that its benefit plans with respect to its senior executive officers comply with the applicable provisions of the emergency economic stabilization act of and the american recovery and reinvestment act of issuance costs of  incurred in connection with the issuance of both the private placement and tarp securities have been charged against additional paid in capital 
the company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the board of governors and the occ 
the company is required to maintain total capital equal to at least of assets and commitments to extend credit  weighted by risk  of which at least must consist primarily of common equity including retained earnings tier capital and the remainder may consist of subordinated debt  cumulative preferred stock or a limited amount of allowance for credit losses 
certain assets and commitments to extend credit present less risk than others and will be assigned to lower risk weighted categories requiring less capital allocation than the total ratio 
for example  cash and government securities are assigned to a risk weighted category  most home mortgage loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring a capital allocation and commercial loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring an capital allocation 
as of december   the company s and the bank s total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively for the company and for the bank at december

the regulations establish five capital categories with the following characteristics well capitalized  consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and which are not operating under an order  written agreement  capital directive or prompt corrective action directive  adequately capitalized  consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and which do not meet the definition of a well capitalized institution  undercapitalized  consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  significantly undercapitalized  consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  and critically undercapitalized  consisting of institutions with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
financial institutions classified as undercapitalized or below are subject to various limitations including  among other matters  certain supervisory actions by bank regulatory authorities and restrictions related to i growth of assets  ii payment of interest on subordinated indebtedness  iii payment of dividends or other capital distributions  and iv payment of management fees to a parent holding company 
the fdicia requires the bank regulatory authorities to initiate corrective action regarding financial institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements 
such action may result in orders to  among other matters  augment capital and reduce total assets 
critically undercapitalized financial institutions may also be subject to appointment of a receiver or implementation of a capitalization plan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity interest rate sensitivity the bank strives to manage its liquidity to provide adequate funds at an acceptable cost to support the borrowing requirements and deposit flows of its customers 
liquidity requirements are evaluated by taking into consideration factors such as deposit concentrations  seasonality and maturities  loan and lease demand  capital expenditures and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
the bank s business is generated primarily through customer referrals and employee business development efforts 
the bank is primarily a business and professional bank and  as such  its deposit base is more susceptible to economic fluctuations 
the bank strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
at december   liquid assets as a percentage of deposits were as compared to in in addition to cash and due from banks  liquid assets include interest bearing deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  and unpledged securities available for sale 
management regularly reviews general economic and financial conditions  both external and internal  and determines whether the positions taken with respect to liquidity and interest rate sensitivity continue to be appropriate 
the bank utilizes a monthly gap report as well as a quarterly simulation model to identify interest rate sensitivity over the short and long term 
management considers the results of these analyses when implementing its interest rate risk management activities  including the utilization of certain interest rate hedges 
the following table sets forth the distribution of repricing opportunities  based on contractual terms  of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie interest rate gap divided by interest rate sensitive assets and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio

that is  at december  the volume of assets that might reprice within the next year exceeded the volume of liabilities that might reprice 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of rate decreases 
net interest income is negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates and positively impacted by an increase in interest rates 
to partially mitigate the adverse impact of declining rates  the majority of variable rate loans made by the bank have been written with a minimum floor rate
