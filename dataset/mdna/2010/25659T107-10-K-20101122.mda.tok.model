overview dolby laboratories develops and delivers innovative products and technologies that are used throughout the entertainment industry to produce immersive and enjoyable experiences 
over the years  dolby has introduced innovations that have significantly improved audio entertainment  such as noise reduction for the recording and cinema industries and surround sound for cinema and home entertainment 
as a result of these innovations  we believe the dolby brand has come to symbolize a superior entertainment experience 
our audio technologies are used throughout the global entertainment industry to deliver a premium audio experience to consumers 
use of our technologies in each step of the entertainment creation  distribution  and playback process enables the creator  the producer  and the distributor to develop and present their content to consumers in the manner they intended 
there are a number of current industry trends that provide us with opportunities for future growth  such as the transition to digital television from analog television and the delivery of media content online and via mobile devices 
these trends present us with an opportunity to extend the adoption of our technologies to new devices  as the methods by which content can be delivered and the number of devices capable of playing back the content increase 
we are developing and marketing video technologies that we believe can improve the quality of video presentation 
our offerings include video products aimed at the cinema market  such as our digital cinema server  our dolby d digital cinema products  and our dolby prm professional reference monitor  which we market to video professionals 
in addition  we are developing and marketing voice technologies that improve voice clarity for use in online gaming and other markets 
we view the video and voice markets as early stage opportunities for us 
we believe that our well recognized brand  our existing customer relationships  and our history of introducing successful innovative technologies are important strengths that will help us pursue these opportunities 

table of contents business model dolby laboratories is a global organization that generates revenue by licensing technologies to manufacturers of ce products and to software vendors and by selling products and related services to entertainment content creators and to distributors 
we work with the global entertainment industry in three principal ways first  we offer products and services to content creators  such as studios  broadcasters  and downloadable content service providers to encode content using dolby s technologies 
by encoding content with our technologies  content creators are able to deliver rich and immersive audio experiences for consumers 
second  we license our technology to ce manufacturers and to software vendors so that consumers can enjoy the content that has been encoded with our proprietary technologies 
in so doing  we develop and deliver innovations directly to ce manufacturers and to software vendors 
third  we work directly with standards bodies in an effort to have our technologies adopted in their specifications to ensure a common standard across devices that improves the overall consumer experience 
we have licensed our technologies to ce manufacturers and to software vendors in countries and our licensees distribute their products incorporating our technologies throughout the world 
we sell our products and provide services in over countries 
in fiscal   and  revenue from outside of the united states was   and of our total revenue  respectively 
geographical data for our licensing revenue is based on the location of our licensees headquarters 
products revenue is based on the end location where we ship our products  while services revenue is based on the location where services are performed 
we provide products and services to creators and to distributors of audio content that enable them to encode content using our technologies 
such customers include studios  television broadcasters  cable television operators  satellite television operators  and increasingly  downloadable content service providers 
we then license our technologies  such as dolby digital  dolby digital plus  and dolby pulse  to ce manufacturers and to software providers which enable ce products to decode and play back audio content previously encoded using the same technologies 
today  our technologies are standard in a wide range of consumer entertainment devices  including virtually all dvd players  audio video receivers  and personal computer pc software dvd players 
in addition  the majority of cinemas around the world use our products to play back audio content 
opportunities  challenges  and risks our revenue increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal and we are optimistic about the prospects for our business 
however  our business could be affected by adverse changes in general economic conditions because our technologies are incorporated in entertainment oriented products  which are generally discretionary goods  such as pcs  digital televisions  set top boxes  dvd players and recorders  blu ray disc players  video game consoles  audio video receivers  mobile devices  in car entertainment systems  home theater in a box systems  camcorders  and portable media devices 
deterioration or continued weakness in economic conditions could suppress consumer demand and harm our business in the markets in which we license our technologies and sell our products 
licensing revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue  representing   and of total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  the decrease in our licensing revenue as a percentage of total revenue was due to a greater increase in the growth of our products revenue relative to the growth of our licensing revenue 
we categorize our licensing revenue into the following markets items listed in each market incorporate our technologies pc market primarily comprised of software dvd players and microsoft windows operating systems broadcast market primarily comprised of televisions and set top boxes ce market primarily comprised of dvd players and recorders  blu ray disc players  audio video receivers  and home theater in a box systems 
table of contents other markets gaming primarily comprised of video game consoles mobile primarily comprised of cell phones and other mobile devices licensing services revenue from the administration of joint licensing programs automotive primarily comprised of in car dvd players 
our pc market represented approximately   and of our licensing revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue from our pc market was driven primarily by the inclusion of our technologies in media applications or operating systems often included in pc shipments 
these media applications and operating systems include dvd playback and or dvd authoring functionality that use our technologies 
our pc market also includes revenue from our pc entertainment experience pcee program  a suite of technologies that enhances the audio quality of media on entertainment oriented pcs 
windows  microsoft s newest operating system  incorporates dolby technologies  including dolby digital plus  in four of the six available editions home premium  ultimate  professional  and enterprise 
prior to the release of windows  our technologies were only included in premium consumer editions of microsoft operating systems 
almost half of the world s pc shipments are to the business market 
the inclusion of our technologies in the professional and enterprise editions of windows  which are typically purchased by the business market  increases the potential for us to receive royalties on a greater percentage of pc shipments 
there are several uncertainties associated with the windows opportunity  including the following the inclusion of our technologies in windows professional and enterprise editions could result in our technologies residing in a greater percentage of pcs  though the benefit from this potential significant increase in reported units will be partially offset by substantial discounts  thereby reducing the average per unit royalty we would receive from microsoft over time 
we currently receive royalties from pcs that ship with third party dvd software applications containing our technologies 
as windows provides enhanced dvd playback and incorporates some of the functionality found in these third party software applications  some pc manufacturers have excluded  and others may exclude in the future  third party dvd software applications from their offerings 
business customers may take several years to upgrade to windows given the longer adoption cycles associated with enterprise customers 
consumers are increasingly purchasing low cost pcs  particularly netbooks and tablets  and this trend could continue in the future 
we expect these pcs to be sold with windows starter or home basic editions or other non windows operating systems  which do not contain our technologies 
our broadcast market  driven by demand for our technologies in televisions and set top boxes  represented approximately   and of our licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our broadcast market has benefited from increased global shipments of digital televisions containing our technologies in fiscal we view the broadcast market as an area for continued growth  primarily driven by broadcast markets outside of the united states 
we also view broadcast services  such as terrestrial broadcast or iptv services  which operate under particular bandwidth constraints  as another area of opportunity for us to offer dolby digital plus  he aac  and dolby pulse  which enable the delivery of high quality audio content at reduced bit rates  thereby conserving bandwidth 
notwithstanding our success in the broadcast market to date  we may not be able to capitalize on these opportunities and actual results may differ from our expectations 
our ce market  which was driven primarily by revenue attributable to sales of dvd players and recorders and blu ray disc players  represented approximately   and of licensing revenue in fiscal  
table of contents  and  respectively 
within our ce market in fiscal  we experienced an increase in revenue from blu ray disc players when compared to fiscal partially offset by decreases in revenue from camcorders that incorporate our technologies and from dvd players 
in fiscal  we had an increase in revenue from reported shipments of camcorders with our technologies that pertained to prior period sales 
blu ray disc continues to represent a revenue growth opportunity within our ce market  as blu ray disc players are required to support dolby digital for primary audio content and dolby digital plus for secondary audio content  and dolby truehd is an optional audio standard 
however  there is a risk that revenue growth from blu ray disc players may not offset future declines in revenue from dvd players 
revenue generated from our other markets was driven by gaming  mobile  licensing services  and automotive 
gaming and automotive revenue was primarily driven by sales of video game consoles  portable gaming devices  and in car entertainment systems with dolby digital  atrac  dolby truehd  and dolby digital plus technologies 
mobile revenue was primarily driven by demand for the aac  he aac  and dolby pulse audio compression technologies incorporated into mobile devices and to a lesser extent by dolby mobile  our suite of post processing technologies optimized for mobile devices 
we view the mobile market as an area of opportunity to increase revenue  however actual results may differ from our expectations 
revenue from licensing services was primarily driven by demand for standards based audio compression technologies used in broadcast  pcs  ce and mobile devices 
we have introduced new products and technologies that may allow further expansion of our broadcast and gaming markets  including our professional reference monitor product  dolby volume  and dolby axon 
our professional reference monitor is a flat panel video reference display for video professionals so they can complete color critical tasks  such as calibrating color accuracy to professional reference standards 
our professional reference monitor uses our dynamic range imaging technologies  which enable enhanced contrast  extended brightness and dynamic range  along with reduced power consumption in led backlit lcd televisions 
dolby volume is a sound leveling technology providing consistent volume and quality across various programs by performing measurement and analysis of signals according to a model based on the characteristics of human hearing 
dolby axon is a voice technology that delivers surround sound and enables online gamers to perceive the spatial location of other players  thus making the online gaming experience real and immersive 
we do not anticipate generating significant revenue from these products and technologies in fiscal digital entertainment products throughout the world incorporate our technologies 
we expect that sales of products incorporating our technologies in emerging economies  such as brazil  china  india  and russia  will increase as consumers in these markets have more disposable income to purchase entertainment products  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we also expect that manufacturers from lower cost manufacturing countries  including china  will increase production of digital entertainment products in the future to satisfy this increased demand 
there are risks associated with the opportunities of doing business in emerging economies that have affected  and will continue to affect  our operating results  such as manufacturers failing to report or underreporting product shipments containing our technologies 
products revenue consists primarily of sales of equipment to cinema operators and broadcasters representing   and of our total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our cinema products represented approximately   and of total products revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
this increase in cinema products revenue as a percentage of total revenue and total product revenue in fiscal was primarily due to increased unit sales of d and digital cinema products  coupled with a change in revenue recognition accounting standards 
see note summary of significant accounting policies for additional details about the changes in revenue recognition accounting standards 
there is a trend in the cinema industry to transition to digital cinema 
digital cinema offers the cinema industry a possible means to achieve cost savings in printing and distributing movies  to combat piracy  
table of contents and to enable repeated movie playback without degradation in image and audio quality 
we offer our dolby digital cinema server  which allows for the storage and playback of digital content 
we expect most exhibitors  which are either constructing new theaters or upgrading existing theaters  to choose digital cinema over traditional film cinema 
our digital d products provide d image capabilities when combined with a digital cinema projector and server 
we believe the success of certain recent d cinema releases is leading to the creation and distribution of cinema content 
we expect an increase in these releases to further drive the transition to d enabled screens because these screens will be needed to accommodate the increasing number of d motion pictures 
we have shipped over  d cinema units to equip screens around the world 
we view the transition to d enabled screens as a growth opportunity  however  actual results may differ from our expectations 
digital cinema is based on open standards  which  unlike traditional cinema standards  do not include our proprietary audio technologies 
we are facing more pricing and other competitive pressures in the digital cinema products market than we have historically experienced in our traditional cinema market 
several competitors have introduced digital cinema products that support the presentation of movies with higher resolution k digital cinema projectors 
certain major us exhibitors have begun installing k digital cinema equipment into their theaters 
in the future  other exhibitors may feel that they need to outfit some or all of their theaters with k digital cinema equipment to compete in the same markets where competitors are promoting k products 
dolby currently does not offer a k digital cinema product 
if we do not offer a product that supports k presentation  our future prospects in digital cinema may be limited and our business could be adversely affected 
our traditional cinema products are primarily used to read and decode a film s soundtrack  to calibrate cinema sound systems  and to adapt analog cinema audio systems to digital audio formats 
in fiscal  as the cinema industry transitions to digital cinema  revenue from our traditional cinema products has declined as a percentage of total cinema products revenue due to increases in d digital cinema revenue 
we expect this decline to continue 
our broadcast products represented approximately   and of products revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our broadcast products are used to encode  transmit  and decode multiple channels of high quality audio content for dtv and hdtv program production and broadcast distribution and to measure the subjective loudness of audio content within broadcast programming 
the decrease in broadcast product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in d and digital cinema product revenue noted above 
our services revenue  which represented approximately   and of total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively  is primarily tied to the cinema industry and  in particular  to the number of films being made by studios and independent filmmakers 
several factors influence the number of films produced in a given fiscal period  including strikes and work stoppages within the cinema industry as well as tax incentive arrangements that many governments provide filmmakers to promote local filmmaking 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap  and pursuant to securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations 
us gaap and sec rules and regulations require us to use accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if it is both important to a 
table of contents company s financial condition and or results of operations and if it requires significant judgment on the part of management in its application 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgment  and estimates 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies and estimates because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management judgments about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
see our risk factors for further information on the potential risks to our future results of operations 
revenue recognition we enter into revenue arrangements with our customers to license technologies  trademarks  and know how and to sell products and services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
judgment is required to assess whether collectibility is probable 
we determine collectibility based on an evaluation of our customer s recent payment history  the existence of a standby letter of credit between the customer s financial institution and our financial institution  and other factors 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the revenue recognition accounting standards to exclude sales of qualifying tangible products that contain essential software elements from the scope of the software revenue recognition standards 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted this accounting standard for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after september  due to this adoption  we no longer account for product sales that contain software elements under the software revenue recognition standards 
also in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple element me revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether these arrangements exist  how the elements should be separated  and how fees associated with a revenue arrangement arrangement fees should be allocated to each element  require an entity to allocate arrangement fees using the estimated selling price esp of each element if the entity does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the selling price or third party evidence tpe of the selling price  and  require a vendor to allocate arrangement fees using the relative selling price method 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the amended accounting standards for me revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after september  prior to adoption  we were not able to establish vsoe of the standalone selling price for the undelivered support and maintenance elements for a majority of our me arrangements 
the previous accounting standards required vsoe in order to allocate the arrangement fees to each undelivered element 
since we had not established vsoe  we allocated the arrangement fees to the undelivered element and ratably recognized the revenue over its estimated support period 
under the new accounting guidance  we allocate the arrangement fees to each element based on its relative selling price  which we establish using a selling price hierarchy 
we determine the selling price of each element based on its vsoe  if available  tpe  if vsoe is not available  or esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is 
table of contents available 
in the fiscal quarter ended september   we established vsoe for a majority of the undelivered elements in our me arrangements 
for these arrangements  the vsoe and the esp value are essentially the same 
for arrangements where vsoe does not exist  we use esp 
we determine our best estimate of the selling price for an individual element within a me revenue arrangement using the same methods utilized to determine the selling price of an element sold on a standalone basis 
if we sell the element on a standalone basis  we estimate the selling price by considering actual sales prices 
otherwise  we estimate the selling price by considering internal factors such as pricing practices and margin objectives 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies  customer demands  and industry technology lifecycles 
management applies judgment to establish margin objectives  pricing strategies  and technology lifecycles 
we evaluate each element in a me arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
an element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and delivery of an undelivered element is probable and within our control 
when these criteria are not met  the delivered and undelivered elements are combined and the arrangement fees are allocated to this combined single unit 
our adoption of the amended guidance changed our units of accounting for our revenue transactions by allowing us to use vsoe or esp to allocate the total fees amongst the delivered and undelivered elements in an arrangement 
if the unit separation criteria are met  we account for each element within a me arrangement such as hardware  software  maintenance  and other services separately and we allocate fees from the arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element 
for some arrangements  customers receive certain elements over a period after delivery of the initial product 
these elements may include support and maintenance and or the right to receive upgrades 
revenue allocated to the undelivered element is recognized over either its estimated service period or when the upgrade is delivered 
we do not recognize revenue that is contingent upon the future delivery of products or services or upon future performance obligations 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we have completed all contractual obligations 
we account for the majority of our digital cinema server sales as me arrangements that have two separate units  or elements  of accounting 
the first element consists of our digital cinema server hardware and the accompanying software  which is essential to the functionality of the hardware 
this element is typically delivered at the time of sale 
the second element is the right to receive support and maintenance  which is included with the purchase of the hardware element and is typically delivered over a service period subsequent to the initial sale 
the application of the new revenue accounting standards to our digital cinema server sales typically results in the allocation of a substantial majority of the arrangement fees to the delivered hardware element based on its esp  which we recognize as revenue at the time of sale 
a small portion of the arrangement fees are allocated to the undelivered support and maintenance element  based on its vsoe or esp  and is recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated service period 
goodwill  intangible assets  and long lived assets we evaluate and test our goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below 
our operating segments are aligned with the management principles of our business 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to its fair value 
if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we move to the second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and if an event occurs or circumstances change such that there is an indication of a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

table of contents we use the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units  which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit 
fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit 
during our annual goodwill impairment test  we had two reporting units via  which has no assigned goodwill  and dolby entertainment technology det  with goodwill of million 
the cash flow model was based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs 
we estimated our future revenue by applying growth rates  consistent with those used in our internal forecasts  to our current revenue forecasts 
the revenue and cost estimates were based on several sources including our historical information  third party industry data  and review of our internal operations 
the cash flow forecasts were adjusted by a discount rate of approximately based on our weighted average cost of capital derived by using the capital asset pricing model 
the primary components of this model include weighting our total asset structure between our equity and debt  the risk free rate of return on us treasury bonds  market risk premium based on a range of historical returns and forward looking estimates  and the beta of our common stock 
our model utilized an effective tax rate of approximately 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
our intangible assets principally consist of acquired technology  patents  trademarks  customer relationships  and contracts  which are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives ranging from two to fifteen years 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the total future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes we make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this includes estimating actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  including the timing of the recognition of stock based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
our policy is to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position is sustainable upon examination by tax authorities 
we include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes 
when accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued are reduced in the period and are reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax asset and liability balances  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  and the reserve resulting from uncertainties in income tax positions 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially affected if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or if the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
stock based compensation we determine the expense for all employee stock based compensation awards by estimating their fair value and by recognizing that value as an expense  on a ratable basis  in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period in which our employees earn the awards 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of the grant 
to determine the fair value of a stock based award using the black scholes option pricing model we make assumptions regarding the expected term of the award  the expected future volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate over the expected term of the award 
we estimate the expected term of our stock 
table of contents based awards by evaluating historical exercise patterns of our employees 
we utilize a blend of the historical volatility of our common stock and the implied volatility of our traded options as an estimate of the expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the awards 
we use an average interest rate based on us treasury instruments with terms consistent with the expected term of our awards to estimate the risk free interest rate 
we reduce the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of the grant and revise our estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimate

the increase in licensing revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from our broadcast and pc markets  and to a lesser extent  by increases in revenue from our ce and other markets 
the increase in revenue from our broadcast market was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of digital televisions that incorporate our technologies sold in europe and apac in fiscal when compared to fiscal the increase in revenue from our pc market was primarily driven by a greater number of computers sold containing windows operating systems that incorporate our technologies in fiscal when compared to fiscal the increase in revenue from our ce market was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from blu ray disc players incorporating our technologies in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in revenue attributable to camcorders  and to a lesser extent  dvd players that incorporate our technologies

the increase in revenue from our mobile market was primarily driven by the adoption of he aac technology  which was incorporated into a greater number of mobile devices sold in the current year than in the prior year 
products 
the increase in products revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to increases in d and digital cinema units sold  coupled with our adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standards in the beginning of fiscal we sold a greater number of d and digital cinema units in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to strong market demand driven by the success of certain recent d cinema releases and promotions that offered certain price discounts for various bundled sets of digital cinema units  d units  and d glasses in fiscal in addition  the new revenue recognition accounting standards allow us to recognize substantially all of the revenue associated with our digital cinema products sold in the period of sale 
see note summary of significant accounting policies for additional details 

table of contents the increase in product sales from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by the recognition of approximately million of digital cinema product revenue  including million relating to products sold in years prior to fiscal  as a result of achieving compliance with the digital cinema initiative dci specifications and satisfying all other revenue recognition criteria 
these increases in digital cinema related product revenue were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our traditional cinema products 
services 
the increase in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in film services  particularly mastering services on digital films  and distribution activities 
in addition  fiscal included million of costs incurred under a promotional arrangement with a customer 
this amount was charged against services revenue with no corresponding charge to cost of services 
the decrease in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by a million charge to services revenue as a result of costs incurred under the above described promotional arrangement with a customer in fiscal excluding this item  services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was largely unchanged

products gross margin increased points from fiscal to fiscal due to a greater proportion of higher margin d and digital cinema products sold in fiscal these products carried a higher gross margin in fiscal due  in part  to cost reductions and to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in fiscal the increase in gross margins was also due to the recognition of significant amounts of low margin digital cinema related products revenue and related costs as a result of achieving compliance with the dci specifications in fiscal product sales gross margin decreased by five points from fiscal to fiscal  due to the recognition of revenue and associated costs related to previously deferred digital cinema related equipment sales which had significantly lower margins than our traditional cinema and broadcast products 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  we had not recognized revenue related to sales of our digital cinema related products as we had not yet achieved compliance with the dci specifications 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we achieved compliance with the dci specifications and therefore began recognizing this revenue and related costs 
the total amount of products revenue which we recognized in fiscal as a result of achieving compliance with the dci specifications was million  including million relating to products sold in years prior to fiscal the product margins related to the digital cinema related equipment revenue recognized in fiscal were particularly low due to a combination of factors that are common with new product launches  including higher initial per unit costs resulting from low manufacturing volumes 
additionally  field upgrade costs were incurred after the initial shipment of the products to the end users to ensure our products complied with our contractual obligations 
as a result of these factors  product sales gross margin in fiscal was significantly lower than our product sales gross margin in the prior year 
services gross margin 
cost of services primarily consists of payroll and benefits costs for employees performing our professional services  the cost of outside consultants  and reimbursable expenses incurred on behalf of customers 
services gross margin was unchanged from fiscal to fiscal despite a million reduction to services revenue  related to an arrangement with a customer in fiscal  due to increases in personnel related expenses and performance based compensation in fiscal services gross margin decreased three points from fiscal to fiscal primarily driven by a million reduction to services revenue related to an arrangement with a customer in fiscal  with no corresponding credit to cost of services 
impairment of products provided under operating leases 
our products provided under operating leases represent digital cinema equipment that we leased to exhibitors beginning in fiscal in an effort to encourage the cinema industry to transition to digital cinema 
we receive a virtual print fee from participating film studios for each digital print delivered for exhibition on this equipment 
based on our estimates of future cash flows from virtual print fees and the potential sale value of this equipment  we determined that the equipment was impaired in the third quarter of fiscal accordingly  we recorded the million excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value of the equipment as an impairment charge 
we believe that the remaining carrying value of our products provided under operating leases is recoverable as of september  we have historically recorded the depreciation of our products provided under operating leases to cost of services

foreign currency exchange risk we maintain sales  marketing  and business operations in foreign countries  most significantly in the united kingdom 
we also conduct a growing portion of our business outside of the united states through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar primarily euros  british pounds  and australian dollars

most of our revenue from international markets is denominated in us dollars  while the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currency 
therefore  if the us dollar weakens against the local currency  we will have increased operating expenses  which will only be partially offset by net revenue 
conversely  if the us dollar strengthens against the local currency  operating expenses will decrease  which will only be partially offset by net revenue 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility
