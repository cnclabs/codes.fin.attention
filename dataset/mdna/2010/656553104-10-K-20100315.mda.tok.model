item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a wayzata  minnesota based full service ems contract manufacturer of wire and cable assemblies  printed circuit board assemblies  higher level assemblies and box builds for a wide range of industries 
we serve three major markets within the ems industry aerospace and defense  medical  and the industrial market which includes industrial equipment  transportation  vision  agriculture  oil and gas 
in minnesota  we have facilities in baxter  bemidji  blue earth  fairmont  merrifield and wayzata 
we also have facilities in augusta  wisconsin  and monterrey  mexico 
the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are built to the customer s design specifications and consist of a wide range of simple to highly complex manufacturing processes 
during  we continued our supply chain and lean manufacturing initiatives designed to reduce costs  improve asset utilization and increase responsiveness to customers 
our initiatives focused on improving our ability to promise based on our capabilities and scheduling as well as improving our manufacturing processes and yields by doing it right the first time 
our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base by focusing on sales and marketing efforts that fit our value added service strategy 
our mexico operation allows for medium volume and mix with lower cost production alternatives when the opportunities are presented 
we also benefit from our relationships with asian manufacturers and suppliers that allow us to meet higher volume  lower mix and lower cost customer requirements when lead times and product stability are not as critical 
the global economic downturn started to impact us in the fourth quarter of requiring us to take a number of cost reduction and cash management measures in the first quarter of when we began to experience even deeper cuts in our customer demand levels during the first half of  further actions were required 
during we closed our garner  iowa ems printed circuit board assembly operations and consolidated it into our merrifield  mn facility due to lower customer demand and order cancellations caused by the slow economy 
in addition  we had several large contracts expire during  resulting in a consolidation of our aerospace and defense cable assembly production into our  square foot facility in blue earth  mn 
prior to the consolidations  the majority of aerospace and defense cable assembly was in three fairmont  mn facilities that represented approximately  square feet of assembly production 
in november  we sold a  square foot building in fairmont  minnesota 
we still own two buildings in fairmont which together contain approximately  square feet 
one building is held for sale and the other contains a cnc machining center and office space 
the consolidation efforts reduced facility costs and improved manufacturing processes and material flow 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of compared to in late  we began to see improvement in our revenues  with the fourth quarter of up over the previous quarter  and the day backlog at december  was up compared to september  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the volume decline  excess capacity and high levels of fixed overhead costs for most of the year caused the lower gross profit percentage in as a result of the cost reduction and capacity consolidation efforts which were completed in the latter part of the third quarter  we began to see significant improvements in gross profit performance in the fourth quarter 
our fourth quarter operating income returned to profitability for the first time in our net loss in was  or per diluted common share compared to net income of  or per diluted common share in the vast majority of the loss was experienced in the first three quarters of  with the fourth quarter of gaining the full benefit from the cost reduction efforts taken in the previous quarters  reducing the net loss to  or per diluted common share for the quarter 
a large focus throughout was on cash management and cash conservation 
cash used from operating activities was  for the year  however cash provided from operating activities for the last months of was million 
we worked closely with our bank wells fargo bank  na or wfb throughout the first half of and on august  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement for both our line of credit and our real estate 
table of contents term notes 
terms  conditions and covenants of the agreement were adjusted to better fit the business environment and provided us the time required to adjust to the new sales and capacity levels 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical estimates that require significant judgment are as follows 
allowance for uncollectible accounts when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on outstanding accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of accounts receivable  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we have historically not experienced significant bad debts expense and believe the reserve is adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
we have an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate our inventory based on current usage and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we believe the total reserve at december  is adequate 
long lived and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge might be required to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
in connection with the closing of two facilities in  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  on certain property and equipment that will no longer be used in operations 
valuation allowance we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against these assets  thereby increasing income tax expense or decreasing the income tax benefit in the period the determination is made 
as of december  we expect to recover our deferred tax assets in their entirety  and thus no valuation allowance was deemed necessary 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting estimates and the underlying judgments and uncertainties of those estimates  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 

table of contents no matters have come to our attention since december  that would cause the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially 
operating results the following table presents statement of operations data as percentages of net sales for the indicated year net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses restructuring charges income loss from operations other expenses  net income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales for the years ended december  and  we had net sales of million and million  respectively  a decrease of million or 
we saw sales to our aerospace and defense customers decline mainly due to the end of major contracts and the timing of new replacement business 
the slow economy has also resulted in lower medical and industrial sales  with a larger impact on our industrial customers 
net sales by our major ems industry markets for the year ended december  and are as follows year ended december in thousands change aerospace and defense medical industrial total net sales backlog our day backlog as of december  was approximately million compared to approximately million on september  and approximately million on december  our backlog consists of firm purchase orders and we expect a major portion of the current day backlog to be realized as revenue during the following quarter 
backlog as of the quarter ended in thousands december december aerospace and defense medical industrial total backlog gross profit for the years ended december  and  we had gross profit of million and million  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was a direct result of the decline in sales volume which caused under utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated excess fixed costs 
measures were taken in to adjust our capacity and cost structure which resulted in a continuous improvement quarter over quarter throughout the year 
gross profit for each of the four quarters of was   and  sequentially 
selling selling expenses were million or of net sales for the year ended december  and million or of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease of million was a result of cost management and decreased spending 
our intent is to maintain our sales infrastructure and marketing initiatives during the economic downturn  providing high levels of customer service and taking advantage of the opportunities to expand our customer base 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for the year ended december  and million or of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease of million is mainly attributed to adjusting our cost structure by reducing personnel and discretionary spending levels to be in line with current business levels 

table of contents restructuring and impairment charges we recognized million of restructuring and impairment charges during the year ended december  included in our loss from operations 
the restructuring and impairment costs included million in non cash impairment charges for property and equipment that will no longer be used in operations and million related to employee benefits  contract termination costs  and other expenses incurred to relocate production 
the restructuring and impairment charges were the result of the facility closings and consolidation efforts taken throughout the year to better align our capacity to current customer demand levels 
the cash charges consisted of employee benefit costs of approximately  lease termination fees of  and other expenses incurred to relocate production of  total cash paid in was  with the remaining accrued liabilities of approximately  expected to be paid over the first six months of other income expense other expense for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
interest expense  foreign exchange transaction losses  and finance and legal charges incurred in securing the second amended and restated credit agreement make up the majority of the other expense in income taxes dues to the loss incurred in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  income tax expense for the year ended december  was million 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal net income loss our net loss in was  or per diluted common share compared to net income of  or per diluted common share in as previously stated  the vast majority of the loss was experienced in the first three quarters of  with the fourth quarter gaining the full benefit from the cost reduction efforts taken in the previous quarters 
as a result  the fourth quarter net loss was down to  or per diluted common share 
financial condition and liquidity we believe that our existing financing arrangements and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investments  and debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
credit facility on august   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with wfb which expires  if not renewed  on june  under the new agreement  both the line of credit and real estate term note are subject to variations in the libor rate 
our line of credit bears interest at three month libor at december  
the weighted average interest rate on our line of credit was for the year ended december  the line of credit and other installment debt with wfb contain certain covenants which  among other things  require us to adhere to regular reporting requirements  abide by annual shareholder dividend limitations  maintain certain financial performance  and limit the amount of annual capital expenditures 
the availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements  and advances are at the discretion of the lender 
the line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
this commitment is summarized as described below other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at december  date of expiration line of credit   june  as of december  we have net unused availability under our line of credit agreement of approximately million as supported by our borrowing base 

table of contents cash flow december cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease in cash and cash equivalents on december   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to million at the end of during  we used approximately million of cash flow from operating activities 
the cash flow used in operations is primarily due to net loss of million offset by million of noncash charges  including depreciation  amortization  property and equipment impairment charges  restructuring charges  the change in deferred taxes and other miscellaneous noncash expenses 
the cash flow used for operating assets and liabilities was million 
this was driven by an increase in income taxes receivable of million and a decrease in accruals of million offset in part by a million reduction in accounts receivable and a million reduction in inventory 
our net cash used in investing activities of million is primarily due to million of capital equipment purchases  offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of million and the change in restricted cash of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million consisted of an increase of million on our line of credit  and a net decrease in long term debt of million
