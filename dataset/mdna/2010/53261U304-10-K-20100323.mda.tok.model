item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectation  estimates  and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors  including those we discuss under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we have included a discussion of our acquisition of aem in june in certain portions of the following discussion and analysis section in order to provide some detail on the impact that this transaction has had and that we expect that this transaction will have on our results of operations and liquidity and capital resource requirements 
the unaudited pro forma financial and operational information included herein for the twelve months ended december  have been presented as if the aem acquisition occurred on january  such unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial or operational results would have been had the aem acquisition been consummated on such date 
overview general we are a provider of integrated energy engineering  consulting and implementation solutions specializing in improving the energy efficiency of our clients facilities  reducing their operating costs and carbon emissions 
we perform energy efficiency engineering and consulting as well as the development and implementation of energy efficient lighting  mechanical  electrical  water  weatherization  and renewable energy solutions 

table of contents we serve a wide range of commercial and industrial and public sector clients 
our commercial and industrial clients include many fortune companies for which we provide our energy efficiency solutions directly  as well as utilities for which we manage energy efficiency portfolio projects 
our public sector clients include government agencies and educational institutions  which we serve both through our relationships with escos and directly 
escos are awarded project contracts with the public sector as prime contractors  and we provide energy efficiency expertise to develop and implement tailored solutions under these contracts 
our revenue increased by million  or  to million during from million during we have invested significant capital and resources to build our business infrastructure to provide us with the operational platform to support continued future growth 
the services we provide include engineering and consulting we apply our engineering expertise to analyze each client s energy consumption and operational needs and develop customized energy efficiency solutions 
our energy engineering and consulting services include project development services  energy management planning  energy bill analysis  building energy audits and e commissioning 
we also provide design review and analysis of new construction projects to maximize energy efficiency and sustainability  project management of energy related construction  and processing and procurement of incentive and rebate applications 
implementation we provide a range of energy efficiency and conservation services  including energy efficient lighting upgrade services  mechanical and electrical conservation services  water conservation services  building envelope weatherization services and renewable energy solutions 
our objective is to improve the quality of our clients physical space  maximize their operational savings  capitalize on rebates available to them and reduce their maintenance costs 
we take into consideration factors such as infrastructure requirements  best available technologies  building environmental conditions  hours of operation  energy costs  available utility rebates and tax incentives  and installation  operation and maintenance costs of various efficiency alternatives 
in august  we sold our energy technology segment through which we offered our patented line of hvac and lighting controllers under the emac and umac brand names 
the emac technology provides remote monitoring  management and control of commercial rooftop hvac units 
in early we decided to sell this division  which had incurred significant losses  to allow us to focus on our faster growing energy services business 
we came to agreement with a buyer in early august and closed on the sale on august  this segment has been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
revenue and expense components revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services and the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
revenue includes charges for our engineering  installation and or project management services and the materials we purchase and resell to our customers 
the substantial majority of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts  although we occasionally bill on a time and materials basis 
under fixed price contracts  we bill our clients for each project once the project is completed or throughout the project as specified in the contract 
under time and materials arrangements  we bill our clients on an hourly basis with material costs and other reimbursable expenses passed through and recognized as 
table of contents revenue 
the time it takes to complete our projects ranges from a couple of days for a small project to four to eight months for some of our larger projects 
our revenues are somewhat seasonal with the strongest sales occurring in the second half of the year 
revenue recognition we recognize our revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence has been received that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and client acceptance 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue under either the completed contract method  for short term contracts  or the percentage of completion method for multi month projects 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized once the project is substantially complete  resulting in some variability in revenue 
under the percentage of completion method we recognize revenue throughout the term of the project based on the percentage of costs incurred 
under both methods of revenue recognition  any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue concentration during  honeywell international  inc and johnson controls  inc  both escos  each accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue  while honeywell and urs corporation accounted for approximately and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
we have relationships with large escos that have historically provided repeat revenue and have represented a significant percentage of revenue in any given period 
we expect large esco projects to continue to be a significant component of our total revenue 
in addition  in late we began serving as program managers to some utilities 
we expect these programs and others like them to be significant contributors to our revenue in future periods and one or more may grow to exceed of our total revenue 
as a result  we may experience more client concentration in future periods than we have in the past 
gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of materials  our internal labor and the cost of subcontracted labor 
gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
a portion of our cost of sales  such as the cost of certain supervisory personnel  is relatively fixed 
accordingly  an increase in the volume of sales will generally result in an increase to our gross profit margins since these fixed expenses are not expected to increase proportionately with sales 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  expenses related to our non production management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  
table of contents commission costs related to our independent sales representatives  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  legal and accounting expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 
amortization of intangibles when we acquire other companies we are required to allocate the purchase price between identifiable tangible and intangible assets  with any remaining value allocated to goodwill 
the value allocated to intangible assets is amortized over the estimated life of the related asset 
the acquisitions we completed within  and resulted in approximately million of intangible assets that are being amortized over periods ranging from month to years 
approximately million of these assets were determined to have indefinite lives and were not being amortized 
we determined during that this indefinite lived asset  which was comprised of the parke trade name  was impaired due to our decision to operate all of our businesses under the lime energy name 
as a result  we incurred a one time  million non cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of when we reduced this intangible asset s value to we recorded total amortization expense of million  million and million in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
based on the value of the intangible assets we are currently carrying  we expect to record amortization expense of thousand during and thousand during interest expense  net net interest expense consists of interest expense net of interest income 
net interest expense represents the interest costs associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  our lines of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  the our term notes and various vehicle loans 
all of this debt  with the exception of the mortgage and vehicle loans  was repaid or converted to common stock upon the completion of our public offering in september interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends represent the dividend expense associated with our convertible preferred stock 
all of the convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock in august general business trends and recent developments the trends  events  and uncertainties set out in this section have been identified as those we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect the comparison of historical operating results reported in this report to either other past period results or to future operating results 
these trends  events and uncertainties include recent establishment and expansion of energy efficiency services business in we established our energy efficiency services business through the acquisitions of parke and kapadia 
our acquisition of aem in june as well as additional acquisitions and the opening of new offices have significantly added to this segment 
our energy efficiency services represented 
table of contents of our consolidated revenue in and certain characteristics of this business  such as seasonality  margins and working capital requirements  are fundamentally different than those of our previous business  therefore  we believe our historical results will not be indicative of our future performance 
as an example  in  and  the energy efficiency services business was somewhat seasonal with a disproportionate amount of revenue recognized in the second half of the year 
this seasonality is likely to result in greater fluctuations in our revenue  earnings and working capital requirements throughout the year than we had experienced prior to the establishment of our energy efficiency services business 
because certain of our expenses are relatively fixed  fluctuations in our revenues are also likely to cause fluctuations in our profit 
sale of energy technology division in may we added the emac and umac line of hvac and lighting controllers through the acquisition of maximum performance group  inc mpg 
this product line never reached the level of sales necessary to achieve profitability 
in march we made the decision to exit the business and retained an investment bank to assist us in locating potential buyers 
on august  we sold certain assets of this business  including the rights to the emac and umac technology 
the results of operations from the energy technology segment have been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
during the quarter ended june   in anticipation of the sale  we reduced the carrying value of these assets to their expected fair value  incurring an impairment loss of  aem transaction on june   we acquired aem 
aem provides energy engineering and consulting services and energy efficiency services similar to our existing energy efficiency lighting solutions 
in addition  it provides mechanical and electrical conservation services  water conservation services and renewable energy solutions primarily for government and municipal facilities  all markets that we had not previously participated in 
the majority of aem s clients are escos and it operates primarily on the east coast 
because of the significance of this acquisition  our historical operating results are not expected to be indicative of our future operating results 
in particular  we expect our revenue and expenses to increase substantially as a result of this acquisition 
the following table reflects our historical operating results for selected income statement line items for the year ended december   and the same line items on a pro forma basis assuming the aem acquisition and the related financing transactions occurred effective january  
table of contents year ended december  pro forma actual unaudited revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense amortization of intangibles operating loss other expense loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net loss as a result of our acquisition of aem  our pro forma revenue and gross profit were higher than our actual revenue and gross profit 
also as a result of our acquisition of aem  our pro forma sg a expense was higher than our actual sg a expense 
the higher pro forma sg a expense more than offset the higher gross profit  resulting in a pro forma operating loss that was greater than our actual operating loss 
due to the interest expense that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of aem  our pro forma net interest expense was higher than our actual net interest expense 
as a result of our pro forma operating loss being greater than our actual operating loss and our pro forma net interest expense being higher than our actual net interest expense  our pro forma net loss was greater than our actual net loss 
the acquisition of aem may reduce the seasonality of our consolidated revenue because aem derives the majority of its revenue from long term government contracts that are generally not seasonal in nature 
however  because a few large projects are often responsible for a significant portion of aem s annual revenue  the level of activity  initial project delays or gaps between projects can have a significant impact on the revenue and earnings of a particular period 
we borrowed million on our line of credit to fund the cash portion of the aem acquisition price and we made a million equity infusion into aem immediately following the acquisition for working capital requirements 
the additional interest expense associated with this use of our line of credit has been included in our pro forma results for advb acquisition on november   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with controlling stockholders of advanced biotherapy  inc advb  pursuant to which we agreed to acquire of the outstanding capital stock of advb at per share in exchange for their shares of our common stock 
through a short form merger  we offered the remaining advb stockholders the same consideration for their common stock 
on march   we completed the merger and acquired advb 
advb s assets included approximately million of cash and an  note receivable 
advb s assets also included a revolving credit note due from us  which had an outstanding balance of approximately  as of the closing 
we have cancelled the revolving credit note 
we did not 
table of contents continue to operate advb s prior business and consider the transaction to have been in substance an equity offering in which we issued shares of our common stock in return for approximately million in cash and notes receivable 
public offering on september   we completed an underwritten follow on public offering of our common stock  receiving  in gross proceeds less  in underwriters discount and offering costs of  on october   the underwriters exercised their overallotment and purchased an additional  shares at per share  less a discount of for total net proceeds to the company of  proceeds from the offering were used to repay a million line of credit and million in notes payable 
the balance of the proceeds will be used for other general corporate purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  warranty accrual  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue and profit recognition we recognize our revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence has been received that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and client acceptance 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
historically  we have recognized revenue primarily on a completed contract basis 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized once the project is substantially complete  resulting in some variability in revenue 
this method works well with projects that are smaller and shorter in duration 
aem  however  recognizes  and will continue to recognize  all of its revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
aem s projects generally are larger in terms of revenue and longer in duration  therefore  aem recognizes revenue throughout the term of the project on a completion method based on 
table of contents the percentage of costs incurred 
as a result of the acquisition of aem  we expect that the majority of our revenue will be recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
under both methods of revenue recognition  any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance is largely based upon specific knowledge of clients from whom collection is determined to be doubtful and our historical collection experience with such clients 
if the financial condition of our clients or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  or if our estimates of certain clients ability to pay are incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
during we increased our allowance by  and wrote off receivables of  as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  or of our outstanding accounts receivable 
amortization of intangibles we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with the asc we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and intangible assets based on their fair values  with the excess of purchase price amount being allocated to goodwill 
the determination of the fair values of these intangible assets is based on a number of significant assumptions as determined by us  including evaluations of the future income producing capabilities of these assets and related future expected cash flows or replacement cost of the asset 
we also make estimates about the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets 
should different conditions result in the determination that the value of the acquired intangible assets has been impaired  we could incur write downs of intangible assets  or changes in the estimation of useful lives of those intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing which is discussed in greater detail below 
intangible assets included acquired technology  customer and contractual relationships  client backlog  non competition agreements and trade names 
acquired technology was initially recorded at fair value based on the estimated after tax cost to replace the asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer and contractual relationships represent contractual and separable relationships that we have with certain customers and partners 
these contractual relationships were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows and are amortized over their estimated useful life 
non competition agreements were initially recorded based on the present value of potential profits that could be lost  should the individual initiate a competing enterprise  and are amortized over the minimum term of the non competition agreements 
trade name intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the royalty payments that would need to be paid for the development and use of a comparable trade name should the name be unavailable to us 
trade name intangible assets are deemed to have an indeterminate life and are not amortized 
impairment loss we evaluate all of our long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill and fixed assets  periodically for impairment in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and 
table of contents operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
during  we determined that the parke trade name was impaired as a result of our decision to operate the business under the lime energy name 
as a result we incurred an impairment loss of million  net of the tax benefit  during the fourth quarter of goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  goodwill is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is less than value based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
many assumptions and estimates underlie the determination of an impairment loss  including economic and competitive conditions  operating costs and efficiencies 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
during the fourth quarter of we updated our projections for portions of the energy efficiency services and energy technology businesses and estimated the fair value based on the discounted current value of the estimated future cash flows 
we then compared the calculated fair values of the reporting units to their carrying values 
the analysis did not identify any impairment for the energy efficiency services business  but did indicate that the value of the energy technology s goodwill was impaired 
the decline in the fair value of the energy technology segment was primarily the result of lower than expected sales of the emac line of hvac controllers  in large part due to delays in a project to replace certain obsolete emac components 
as a result of the decline in the fair value  we recorded an impairment loss of million during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarters of we updated our analyses for the energy efficiency services business and concluded that the implied fair value of the businesses based on the discounted current value of the estimated future cash flows exceeded the carrying value  indicating that the goodwill was not impaired 
was the first period that we tested the goodwill associated with the aem purchase for impairment 
for goodwill testing purposes  we analyzed the goodwill associated with the aem acquisition and our c i business separately 
the goodwill impairment analysis indicated there was no goodwill impairment as the fair value of the c i and aem testing units exceeded their carrying values 
we considered various factors in determining the fair value of the testing units  including discounted cash flows from projected earnings  values for comparable companies and the market price of our common stock 
we will continue to monitor for any impairment indicators such as underperformance of projected earnings  net book value compared to market capitalization  declining stock price and significant adverse economic and industry trends 
in the event that either testing unit does not achieve projected results  or  as the result of changes in facts of circumstances  we could incur a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
stock based compensation we have a stock incentive plan that provides for stock based employee compensation  including the granting of stock options and shares of restricted stock  to certain key employees 
the plan is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted asc  share based payment sfas r  which requires that we record stock compensation 
table of contents expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options and restricted stock unit grants  over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we recognized million  million and million of stock compensation related to employee options expense during  and  respectively 
results of operations revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services as well as the sale of our proprietary products and the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
all of our revenue is earned in the united states 
our revenue includes charges for our engineering  installation and or project management services and the materials we purchase and resell to our clients 
the substantial majority of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts  although we occasionally bill on a time and materials basis 
under fixed price contracts  we bill our clients for each project once the project is completed or throughout the project as specified in the contract 
under time and materials arrangements  we bill our clients on an hourly basis with material costs and other reimbursable expenses passed through and recognized as revenue 
historically  our projects have typically been completed within one to three weeks  with the exception of a few multi month projects 
with the addition of aem in june  the number of multi month projects have increased significantly as  historically  aem s projects have typically taken four to eight months to complete 
gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less costs of sales 
the cost of sales consists primarily of materials  our internal labor  including engineering  and the cost of subcontracted labor 
gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
a portion of our expenses  such as the cost of certain salaried project management and engineering personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  an increase in the volume of sales will generally result in an increase to our margins since these fixed expenses are not expected to increase proportionately with sales 
our business is also seasonal  as such  our margins will vary with seasonal changes in our revenue due to the fixed nature of some of our costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  costs of our non production management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  legal and accounting expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 

table of contents amortization of intangibles we incur expenses related to the amortization of identifiable assets that we have capitalized in connection with our acquisitions 
other expense other expense consists of interest expense  net of interest earned on our investments 
interest expense represents the interest costs and fees associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  our lines of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  notes payable and various vehicle loans 
interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
we offer certain customers extended payment terms 
when we record these receivables we are required to discount them using a market rate of interest and amortize the discount over the term of the receivable 
this amortization is recognized as interest income 
dividend expense dividend expense includes dividends accrued on our preferred stock and charges for non cash deemed dividends

revenue derived from our commercial and industrial markets was flat from the prior year 
our revenue increased million or when compared to our pro forma results for this increase again was the result of higher sales in our public sector markets 
uncertainty on the part of our commercial industrial c i customers related to the economy impacted our results in the c i market during we believe that some of this uncertainty has begun to ease and we have seen some projects that were previously on hold begin to move forward 
if things continue to improve as we currently believe they will  we expect that we will see higher revenue from c i customers during revenue from our public sector customers was negatively impacted late in by delays in the release of funds under the american recovery and reinvestment act of commonly referred to as the stimulus 
while the timing of the release of these funds is outside of our control  we anticipate they should begin to be released during the third or fourth quarter of to the extent that they are  we expect that our revenue from public sector clients will be flat to up slightly from levels 
during we began two new initiatives  utility program management and direct federal work under the frr contract 
neither of these new initiatives contributed materially to revenue  but we believe that they could represent as much as to of our revenue 
the combination of the ramp up to the new initiatives and improving conditions in our c i and public sector markets is 
table of contents expected to result in higher revenue in that is heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarters of the year 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit increased million or to million during from million during and million or from pro forma results 
our gross profit margin was during compared to for on a historical basis and on a pro forma basis 
the decline in our gross margin was due to a change in the mix of our business that included a larger portion of lower margin jobs 
our public sector projects and large c i projects typically carry lower margins than small and mid sized c i projects  but these public sector and large c i projects also typically have general higher revenue per associated selling expense 
the gross margins earned from our utility program management initiative are expected to approximate our historical consolidated gross margins  whereas the gross margins from frr projects will be lower than the gross margins earned from our other businesses 
the lower frr gross margins are offset by low  largely fixed sg a for this initiative  thus frr expected to contribute to overall profitability at relatively low revenue levels 
we believe that our consolidated gross margins will increase slightly during as we spread our fixed costs over higher revenue 
our gross margins will vary throughout the year depending on the mix of revenue and overall revenue level  with the highest margins expected in the third and fourth quarters when revenues peak 
selling general administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or during to million from million for the majority of the increase in our sg a was due to the inclusion of twelve months of expense from aem  which was acquired in june our sg a expense increased million or when compared to pro forma sg a 
our sg a as a percent of revenue increased slightly during to from in on a historical basis  but declined from on a pro forma basis 
the increase in sg a expense over pro forma was primarily the result of the investment in the utility program management and frr initiatives during neither of these initiatives had material revenue during  but both are expected to be significant contributors to revenue 
the sg a expense also included a one time reserve of  for a legal settlement 
other changes in sg a included a million decline in our share based compensation expense  which was largely offset by increases in wages  outside services  franchise taxes and rent expense 
we do not intend to increase our sg a headcount significantly  if at all  in  thus expect a much smaller increase in wage expense for the year 
a significant portion of the increase in outside services was related to implementation of a new accounting system at aem and a new corporate email system  neither of which will require the same level of expenditures in in addition  our stockholders authorized a reduction in our authorized shares of common stock at our annual meeting  which will reduce our franchise tax expense during overall  we expect our sg a expense will increase moderately during due primarily to the utility program management and frr initiatives  but we expect our sg a as a percent of our revenue to be lower in than it was in amortization of intangibles amortization expense declined  or  to million during from million in amortization expense has declined as certain intangible assets associated with past acquisitions have become fully amortized 
absent any new acquisitions  we expect our amortization expense will decline to  in and  in impairment loss during we determined that the parke trade name was impaired due to our decision to operate the business under the lime energy name 
as a result  we reduced the carrying value of this intangible asset to  incurring a million impairment loss during the fourth quarter of this loss was partially offset by the reversal of a million deferred tax liability associated with this indefinite lived asset

we used a portion of the proceeds from the follow on offering to repay most of our remaining outstanding debt

our principal cash requirements are for operating expenses  including employee costs  the cost of outside services including those providing accounting  legal  engineering and electrical  mechanical and plumbing contracting services  and the funding of inventory and accounts receivable  and capital expenditures 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the private placement of our common and preferred stock  as well as through various forms of secured debt 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  selected items in our consolidated statement of cash flows in thousands year ended december net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents  at end of period 
table of contents compared to net cash increased million during compared to a decline of million during operating activities operating activities consumed million during and million during whether cash is consumed or generated by operating activities is a function of the profitability of our operations and changes in working capital 
to get a better understanding of cash sources and uses  we like to split the cash used or provided by operating activities into two pieces the cash consumed or generated by operating activities before changes in working capital  and the cash consumed or generated from changes in working capital 
during the cash consumed by operating activities before changes in working capital was million  a or increase over the million consumed during the increase was the result of higher cash sg a expense during resulting from the inclusion of a full twelve months of expense from aem  the costs related to the utility program management and frr initiatives which were launched during  higher wages due to headcount additions  and higher franchise tax expense  outside services and rents 
this was partially offset by an increase in our gross profit during we anticipate that the cash sg a expense will grow at a much lower rate than our revenue and gross profit during resulting in a significant improvement in the cash consumed by operating activities before changes in working capital 
changes in working capital consumed million during  a decline of million or from the million consumed during this improvement was due to increased receivables turnover and a lower and flatter seasonal sales peak during than the one experienced during we expect our working capital requirements to grow as our revenue continues to increase 
however  the utility program management and frr initiatives are both expected to be less working capital intensive than our other existing businesses  therefore we expect that our working capital requirements will not grow as fast as our total revenue in future periods as these two initiatives begin to represent a larger portion of our overall revenue 
investing activities the cash consumed by investing activities declined million to million during from million during cash used for acquisitions declined million to million during  compared to million used during during we made an earn out payment to the former stockholders of aem and we acquired the frr contract

the proceeds from these offerings were partially offset by million in offering related costs 
we used million during to repay our line of credit and million to repay other notes 
we also received  from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan   on the exercise of certain options and warrants and  through the financing of vehicle purchases

this was more than offset by increased interest expense resulting from borrowings under a new line of credit to fund the acquisition of aem and increased working capital 
changes in working capital consumed million during  an increase of million or from the million consumed n the increase in working capital was largely the result of a increase in revenue during investing activities cash consumed in investing activities increased million or to million during from million in cash used for acquisitions increased million to million during from  during we acquired aem  while in we acquired texas energy products and preferred lighting

financing activities net cash generated by financing activities increased million to million in from million during early in we began to work with an investment bank on a public sale of shares of our common stock 
this offering was put on hold in may when the opportunity to acquire aem materialized 
we resumed work on the offering in july  but determined in august that due to deteriorating market conditions  it was unlikely that we would be successful raising capital in the public markets 
we instead decided to use much of the material prepared for the public offering in a private offering to a small group of investors 
we closed a million private placement in november the first million tranche of the private placement  which included non affiliated investors closed on november   while the second tranche  which included affiliated investors  closed in january following the completion of mailing to our stockholders as required by sec rules 
we incurred  in expense related to our fund raising efforts 
also during we drew million on our line of credit to fund the acquisition of aem  million to fund an equity infusion into aem to assist with its working capital requirements and million to fund the consolidated working capital and general operating requirements of the company 
we also borrowed  to fund the acquisition of service delivery vehicles and made scheduled payments of  on our mortgage and various other notes 
in addition  we received  during from the exercise of options and warrants 

table of contents sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash reserves  which were million on december  our ability to continue to expand the sales of our products and services will require the continued commitment of significant funds 
the actual timing and amount of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount  timing and profitability of future revenues  working capital requirements  the level and amount of product marketing and sales efforts  among other things 
we have raised a significant amount of capital since our formation through the issuance of shares of our common and preferred stock and notes  which has allowed us acquire companies and to continue to execute our business plan 
most of these funds have been consumed by operating activities  either to fund our losses or for working capital requirements 
in an attempt to move the company to a position where it can start to generate positive cash flow our management has set the following key strategies for cash flow improvement in focus on increasing the sales and profitability of our products and services while controlling the growth in our sg a expense 
we believe that to a great degree our ability to generate positive cash flow is dependent on our ability to increase sales while controlling the growth of our sg a and maintaining or improving our gross margins 
we believe that we have built a corporate infrastructure over the past three years that is capable of supporting a large  diversified national company 
we believe that this infrastructure can support significantly higher revenue without a proportional increase in our sg a 
we are focused on continually reducing our sg a expense as a percentage of revenue with a target of reducing it to to within the next three to five years  which we believe is a sustainable sg a expense ratio for the business over the longer term and reflects our expectations with respect to our ability to achieve additional operating leverage 
if we are able to achieve this goal  while holding or improving our gross margins  we believe we will begin to generate positive cash flow and earnings within the next to months 
aggressively manage our costs in order to conserve cash 
the prudent use of the capital resources available to us remains one of our top priorities 
we are constantly reviewing our operations looking for more efficient ways to achieve our objectives 
we believe that if we are successful in increasing our revenue while controlling the growth in our operating expenses we should have sufficient liquidity to allow us to operate until our operations turn cash flow positive 
the information set forth above represents certain expectations of our business over time based on our business model 
we caution you that these expectations may not materialize and are not indicative of the actual results we will achieve
