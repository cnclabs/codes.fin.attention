item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities 
market prices of wholesale shell eggs are volatile and changes in these prices and costs can adversely impact our results of operations 
our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
small increases in production or small decreases in demand can have a large adverse effect on shell egg prices 
shell egg prices trended upward from calendar until late and early when they rose to historical highs 
in the early fall of calendar  the demand trend related to the increased popularity of high protein diets faded dramatically and prices fell 
during the time of increased demand  the egg industry had geared up to produce more eggs  resulting in an oversupply of eggs 
since calendar  supplies appear to be more closely balanced with demand and egg prices again reached record levels during and egg prices have since retreated from those record price levels due to small increases in industry supply 
there can be no assurance that shell egg prices will remain at or near current levels or that the supply of and demand for shell eggs will remain level in the future 
in general  a increase or decrease in industry supply will translate into a corresponding change in shell egg prices 
retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in shell egg production during the spring and early summer 
shell egg prices tend to increase with the start of the school year and are highest prior to holiday periods  particularly thanksgiving  christmas and easter 
consequently  we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in august and may  respectively 
as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons 
changes in consumer demand for shell eggs can negatively impact our business 
we believe that fast food restaurant consumption  reports from the medical community regarding the health benefits of shell eggs  reduced shell egg cholesterol levels  high protein diet trends and industry advertising campaigns have all contributed to shell egg demand 
however  there can be no assurance that the demand for shell eggs will not decline in the future 
adverse publicity relating to health concerns and changes in the perception of the nutritional value of shell eggs  as well as movement away from high protein diets  could adversely affect demand for shell eggs  which would have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
feed costs are volatile and changes in these costs can adversely impact our results of operations 
feed cost represents the largest element of our shell egg production farm cost  ranging from to of total farm production cost in the last five years 
although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources  we have little  if any  control over the prices of the ingredients we purchase  which are affected by weather and by various supply and demand factors 
increases in feed costs not accompanied by increases in the selling price of eggs can have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
alternatively  low feed costs can encourage industry overproduction  possibly resulting in lower egg prices 
due to the cyclical nature of our business  our financial results from year to year may fluctuate 
the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
in the past  during periods of high profitability  shell egg producers have tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs  which generally has caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand return to balance 
as a result  our financial results from year to year may vary significantly 
we purchase approximately of the shell eggs we sell from outside producers and our ability to obtain such eggs at prices and in quantities acceptable to us could fluctuate 
we produce approximately of the total number of shell eggs sold by us and purchase the remaining amount from outside producers 
as the wholesale price for shell eggs increases  our cost to acquire shell eggs from outside producers also increases 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire shell eggs from outside producers in quantities and prices that are satisfactory and our inability to do so may have a material adverse affect on our business and profitability 
our acquisition growth strategy subjects us to various risks 
we plan to continue to pursue a growth strategy  which includes acquisitions of other companies engaged in the production and sale of shell eggs 
acquisitions can require capital resources and divert management s attention from our existing business 
acquisitions also entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities  including liabilities arising from events or conduct prior to our acquisition of a business that were not known to us at the time of acquisition 
we may also incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we had anticipated at the time of its purchase 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms  or can successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or successfully manage the operations of any acquired business 
no assurance can be given that companies acquired by us in the future will contribute positively to our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  federal anti trust laws require regulatory approval of acquisitions that exceed certain threshold levels of significance 
the consideration we pay in connection with any acquisition also affects our financial results 
if we pay cash  we could be required to use a portion of our available cash to consummate the acquisition 
to the extent we issue shares of our common stock  existing stockholders may be diluted 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt 
our largest customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales volume 
accordingly  our business may be adversely affected by the loss of  or reduced purchases by  one or more of our large customers 
for the fiscal years   and  two affiliated customers  wal mart stores and sam s clubs  on a combined basis  accounted for   and of our net sales dollars  respectively 
in addition  during fiscal  another customer  publix super markets  inc  accounted for of net sales dollars 
our top ten customers accounted for   and of net sales dollars during those periods 
we have established long term relationships with most of our customers  who continue to purchase from us based on our ability to service their needs 
if  for any reason  one or more of our larger customers were to purchase significantly less of our shell eggs in the future or were to terminate their purchases from us  and we are not able to sell our shell eggs to new customers at comparable levels  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations  including environmental regulations  could harm our operating results  financial condition and reputation 
we are subject to federal and state regulations relating to grading  quality control  labeling  sanitary control and waste disposal 
as a fully integrated shell egg producer  our shell egg facilities are subject to usda and fda regulation  as well as regulation by various state and local health and agricultural agencies 
our shell egg processing facilities are subject to periodic usda inspections 
all of our shell egg and feed mill facilities are subject to fda regulation and inspections 
our operations and facilities are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use  transportation  disposal and remediation of hazardous materials 
under these laws and regulations  we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities  including  but not limited to wastewater discharge permits 
if we fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation  or fail to obtain any necessary permits  we could be subject to significant fines and penalties or other sanctions  our reputation could be harmed and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  because these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future 
our business is highly competitive 
the production and sale of fresh shell eggs  which have accounted for virtually all of our net sales in recent years  is intensely competitive 
we compete with a large number of competitors that may prove to be more successful than we are in marketing and selling shell eggs 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with any or all of these companies 
in addition  increased competition could result in price reductions  greater cyclicality  reduced margins and loss of market share  which would negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
pressure from animal rights groups regarding the treatment of animals may subject us to additional costs to conform our practices to comply with developing standards or subject us to marketing costs to defend challenges to our current practices and protect our image with our customers 
we and many of our customers are facing pressure from animal rights groups  such as people for the ethical treatment of animals  or peta  and the humane society of the united states  to require that any companies that supply food products operate their business in a manner that treats animals in conformity with certain standards developed by these animal rights groups 
as a result  we are reviewing and changing our operating procedures with respect to our flock of hens to meet some or all of these treatment standards 
the treatment standards require  among other things  that we provide increased cage space for our hens and modify beak trimming and forced molting practices the act of putting chickens into a regeneration cycle 
these groups have made legislative efforts to ban any form of caged housing in various states 
changing our procedures and infrastructure to conform to these guidelines has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs to our internal production of shell eggs  including cost increases from housing and feeding the increased flock population resulting from the modification of molting practices  and the cost for us to purchase shell eggs from our outside suppliers 
while some of these increased costs have been passed on to our customers  we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to pass on these costs  or any additional costs we will face  in the future 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of any key member of this team may adversely affect the implementation of our business plan in a timely manner 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our senior management team  including fred r 
adams  jr  our chairman and chief executive officer 
the loss or interruption of mr 
adams services or those of one or more of our other executive officers could adversely affect our ability to manage our operations effectively and or pursue our growth strategy 
we have not entered into any employment or non compete agreements with any of our executive officers nor do we carry any significant key man life insurance on any such persons 
agricultural risks could harm our business 
our shell egg production activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
unusual or extreme weather conditions  disease and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of shell eggs we produce and distribute 
if a substantial portion of our production facilities are affected by any of these factors in any given quarter or year  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are controlled by a principal stockholder 
fred r 
adams  jr  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and his spouse own of the outstanding shares of our common stock  which has one vote per share 
in addition  mr 
adams owns and his son in law  adolphus b 
baker  our president  chief operating officer and director  owns of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock  which has ten votes per share 
mr 
baker and his spouse also own of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  currently mr 
adams and his spouse possess  and messrs 
adams and baker and their spouses possess  of the total voting power represented by the outstanding shares of our common stock and class a common stock 
these stockholdings include shares of our common stock accumulated under our employee stock ownership plan for the respective accounts of messrs 
adams and baker 
the adams family intends to retain ownership of a sufficient amount of common stock and class a common stock to assure its continued ownership of over of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock 
such ownership will make an unsolicited acquisition of us more difficult and discourage certain types of transactions involving a change of control of our company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation require that our class a common stock be issued only to fred r 
adams  jr 
and members of his immediate family  and that if shares of our class a common stock  by operation of law or otherwise  are deemed not to be owned by mr 
adams or a member of his immediate family  the voting power of any such shares shall be automatically reduced to one vote per share 
the adams family s controlling ownership of our capital stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
based on mr 
adams beneficial ownership of our outstanding capital stock  we are a controlled company  as defined in rule c of the listing standards of the nasdaq global market on which our shares of common stock are quoted 
accordingly  we are exempt from certain requirements of nasdaq s corporate governance listing standards  including the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and the requirements regarding the determination of compensation of executive officers and the nomination of directors by independent directors

item legal proceedings personal injury chicken litter litigation cal maine farms  inc is presently a defendant in two personal injury cases in the circuit court of washington county  arkansas 
those cases are styled  mcwhorter vs 
alpharma  inc  et al  and carroll  et al 
vs 
alpharma  inc  et al 
cal maine farms  inc 
was named as a defendant in the mcwhorter case on february  it was named as a defendant in the carroll case on may  co defendants in both cases include other integrated poultry companies such as tyson foods  inc  cargill  incorporated  george s farms  inc  peterson farms  inc  simmons foods  inc  and simmons poultry farms  inc 
the manufacturers of an additive for broiler feed are also included as defendants 
those defendants are alpharma  inc and alpharma animal health  co 
both cases allege that the plaintiffs have suffered medical problems resulting from living near land upon which litter from the defendants flocks was spread as fertilizer 
the mcwhorter case focuses on mold and fungi allegedly created by the application of litter 
the carroll case also alleges injury from mold and fungi  but focuses primarily on the broiler feed ingredient as the cause of the alleged medical injuries 
no trial date for either the carroll or mcwhorter case has been set 
several other separate  but related  cases were prosecuted in the same venue by the same attorneys 
the same theories of liability were prosecuted in all of the cases 
no cal maine company was named as a defendant in any of those other cases 
the plaintiffs selected one of those cases  green  et al 
vs 
alpharma  inc  et al  as a bellwether case to go to trial first 
all of the poultry defendants were granted summary judgment in the green case on august  on may   however  the arkansas supreme court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the poultry defendants and remanded the case for trial 
green was re tried  and again resulted in a defense verdict 
the plaintiffs have appealed this judgment 
the appeal was noticed in july the appeal is pending 
there has been no effort by the plaintiffs in the mcwhorter and carroll cases to set those cases for trial 
whether the plaintiffs in those cases will prosecute those cases to trial is not known  and their likelihood of success if they do cannot be gauged at this time 
state of oklahoma watershed pollution litigation on june   the state of oklahoma filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma  against a number of companies  including cal maine foods  inc and cal maine farms  inc we and cal maine farms filed our joint answer and motion to dismiss the suit on october  the state of oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants have polluted the illinois river watershed 
this watershed provides water to eastern oklahoma 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages 
the parties participated in a series of mediation meetings without success 
cal maine foods  inc no longer operates in the watershed 
accordingly  we do not anticipate that cal maine foods  inc will be materially affected by the request for injunctive relief 
cal maine foods  inc owns of benton county foods  llc  which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the illinois river watershed 
benton county foods  llc is not a defendant in the litigation 
the district court has dismissed all damages claims against all defendants 
the basis for that ruling was the absence of a necessary party plaintiff  the cherokee nation 
the cherokee nation owns part of the land and water in the watershed 
after the dismissal of the damages claims  the cherokee nation attempted to intervene as a plaintiff 
this attempt was rejected by the district court 
the cherokee nation has appealed that denial to the th circuit court of appeals 
the appeal was noticed in september  and was heard on may  but no decision has been rendered 
the remaining claims relate to the state of oklahoma s request for injunctive relief  and the state of oklahoma s request for statutory penalties against the defendants for alleged polluting activities 
the trial of these remaining claims began on september  the trial of this matter has been concluded and the judge has heard final arguments 
no decision has been rendered  but one is expected in the near future 
egg antitrust litigation between september  and january   the company was named as one of several defendants in sixteen antitrust cases involving the united states shell egg industry 
in all sixteen cases  the named plaintiffs sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated 
in fourteen of the cases  the named plaintiffs allege that they are retailers or distributors that purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants 
in the other two cases  the named plaintiffs are individuals who allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products indirectly from one or more of the defendants that is  they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties 
the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated all of these cases as well as certain other cases in which the company was not a named defendant for pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the pennsylvania court has organized the cases around two groups direct purchasers and indirect purchasers and has named interim lead counsel for the named plaintiffs in each group 
the direct purchaser case 
the named plaintiffs in the direct purchaser case filed a consolidated complaint on january  on april   the company filed motions to dismiss the direct purchasers consolidated complaint 
the direct purchaser plaintiffs did not respond to those motions 
instead  the direct purchaser plaintiffs announced a potential settlement with one defendant 
that settlement is still subject to court approval  but if it is approved  the settlement would not require the settling party to pay any money 
instead  the settling defendant  while denying all liability  would provide cooperation in the form of documents and witness interviews to the plaintiffs attorneys 
after announcing this potential settlement with one defendant  the direct purchaser plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on december  on february   the company joined with other defendants in moving to dismiss the direct purchaser plaintiffs claims for damages outside the four year statute of limitations period and claims arising from a supposed conspiracy in the egg products sector 
on february   the company filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the direct purchaser plaintiffs amended complaint 
on june   the direct purchaser plaintiffs announced a potential settlement with a second defendant 
this settlement is still subject to court approval 
if this settlement is approved  then the defendant would pay a total of million and would provide other consideration in the form of documents  witness interviews  and declarations 
this settling defendant denied all liability in its potential agreement with the direct purchaser plaintiffs and stated publicly that it settled merely to avoid the cost and uncertainty of continued litigation 
the indirect purchaser case 
the named plaintiffs in the indirect purchaser case filed a consolidated complaint on february  on april   the company filed motions to dismiss the indirect purchasers consolidated complaint 
the indirect purchaser plaintiffs did not respond to those motions 
instead  the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on april  on may   the company joined with other defendants in moving to dismiss the indirect purchaser plaintiffs claims for damages outside the four year statute of limitations period  claims arising from a supposed conspiracy in the egg products sector  claims arising under certain state antitrust and consumer frauds statutes  and common law claims for unjust enrichment 
on june   the company filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the indirect purchaser plaintiffs amended complaint 
allegations in each case 
in both consolidated complaints  the named plaintiffs allege that the company and certain other large domestic egg producers conspired to reduce the domestic supply of eggs in a concerted effort to raise the price of eggs to artificially high levels 
in both consolidated complaints  plaintiffs allege that all defendants agreed to reduce the domestic supply of eggs by a manipulating egg exports and b implementing industry wide animal welfare guidelines that reduced the number of hens and eggs 
the indirect purchaser plaintiffs also say in conclusory fashion that all defendants manipulated pricing information in the egg industry  exchanged price information improperly  and refused to compete against each other 
both groups of named plaintiffs seek treble damages and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and all other putative class members in the united states 
both groups of named plaintiffs allege a class period starting on january  and running through the present 
the direct purchaser consolidated case alleges two separate sub classes one for direct purchasers of shell eggs and one for direct purchasers of egg products 
the direct purchaser consolidated case seeks relief under the sherman act 
the indirect purchaser consolidated case seeks relief under the sherman act and the statutes and common law of various states  the district of columbia  and puerto rico 
the pennsylvania court has entered a series of orders related to case management and scheduling 
there is no definite schedule in either consolidated case for discovery  class certification proceedings  or filing motions for summary judgment 
no trial date has been set in either consolidated case 
the company intends to continue to defend these cases as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the company believes are meritorious and provable 
the company does not intend to enter into settlement discussions with the plaintiffs 
florida civil investigative demand on november   the company received an antitrust civil investigative demand from the attorney general of the state of florida 
the demand seeks production of documents and responses to interrogatories relating to the production and sale of eggs and egg products 
the company is cooperating with this investigation and expects to provide responsive information 
no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the company in this matter

in addition  because the following discussion includes numerous forward looking statements relating to us  our results of operations  financial condition and business  reference is made to the information set forth in the section of part i immediately preceding item above under the caption forward looking statements 
overview cal maine foods  inc we  us  our  or the company is primarily engaged in the production  grading  packaging  marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs 
our fiscal year end is the saturday nearest to may which was may  weeks  may  weeks  and may  weeks for the most recent three fiscal years 
our operations are fully integrated 
at our facilities we hatch chicks  grow and maintain flocks of pullets young female chickens  usually under weeks of age  layers mature female chickens and breeders male or female birds used to produce fertile eggs to be hatched for egg production flocks  manufacture feed  and produce  process and distribute shell eggs 
we are the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the united states 
we market the majority of our shell eggs in states  primarily in the southwestern  southeastern  mid western  and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
we market our shell eggs through our extensive distribution network to a diverse group of customers  including national and regional grocery store chains  club stores  foodservice distributors  and egg product manufacturers 
our operating results are directly tied to egg prices  which are highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations  and are outside of our control 
the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
in the past  during periods of high profitability  shell egg producers have tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs  which generally has caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand return to balance 
as a result  our financial results from year to year may vary significantly 
shorter term  retail sales of shell eggs historically have been greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
our need for working capital generally is highest in the last and first fiscal quarters ending in may and august  respectively  when egg prices are normally at seasonal lows 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in shell egg production during the spring and early summer 
shell egg prices tend to increase with the start of the school year and are highest prior to holiday periods  particularly thanksgiving  christmas  and easter 
consequently  we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in august and may  respectively 
because of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons 
we currently use contract producers for approximately of our total egg production 
contract producers operate under agreements with us for the use of their facilities in the production of shell eggs by layers owned by us 
we own the shell eggs produced under these arrangements 
approximately of the total number of shell eggs sold by us is purchased from outside producers for resale  as needed 
our cost of production is materially affected by feed costs  which currently averages about of our total farm egg production cost 
changes in market prices for corn and soybean meal  the primary ingredients of the feed we use  result in changes in our cost of goods sold 
the cost of our feed ingredients  which are commodities  are subject to factors over which we have little or no control such as volatile price changes caused by weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs  demand and the agricultural and energy policies of the united states and foreign governments 
the corn and soybean crops were large for the crop year 
feed ingredient prices have decreased recently from levels seen during the summer months of calendar  but remain high on a historical basis 
market prices for corn remain higher in part because of increasing demand from ethanol producers 
planted acreage for corn is expected to increase for the crop year 
market prices for soybean meal remain high because of competition for planted acres for other grain production 
feed costs  while considerably lower than in calendar  will likely remain relatively high  and could be volatile in the year ahead 
the purchase of zephyr egg  llc and tampa farms  llc described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements are collectively referred to below as the acquisitions 
in fiscal  we acquired zephyr egg  llc in the first quarter 
we acquired tampa farms  llc in the third quarter of fiscal in the results of operations comparison between fiscal and fiscal  the exclusion of the acquisitions refers to the impact on the results of operations for fiscal if the acquisitions had not occurred 
to increase comparability in the results of operations comparison between fiscal and fiscal  the exclusion of the acquisitions refers to the exclusion of the fiscal first and second quarter results of operations for tampa farms  llc  because tampa farms  llc was not acquired until the third quarter of fiscal since zephyr egg  llc s results of operations are included in all four quarters of fiscal and fiscal  there was no adjustment necessary in the results of operations comparisons for these periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain items from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales

primarily  our shell eggs are sold at prices related to the urner barry spot egg market quotations for the southeastern region of the country 
the following table shows our net income loss  net average shell egg selling price  and the average urner barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region  for each of our three most recent fiscal years 
fiscal year ended may  may  may  net income attributable to cal maine foods  inc in thousands net average shell egg selling price average urner barry spot egg market quotations average daily price for the fiscal year the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
the periods of high profitability reflect increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss reflect excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand 
historically  demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth 
as reflected above  our operating results correspond with changes in the spot egg market quote 
the net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs  including non graded shell egg sales  breaking stock and undergrades 
in fiscal and  shell egg demand increased at higher than normal trend rates due to the increased popularity of high protein diets 
this demand imbalance caused shell egg prices to increase 
in late fiscal  the popularity of these high protein diets began to diminish  but our egg production had been increased to meet the earlier higher demand levels 
lower egg prices followed  and we experienced net losses in fiscal and beginning in the latter part of fiscal  egg supplies appeared to become more aligned with demand 
since that time  the supply demand balance has tightened 
tighter supplies resulted in increased prices in fiscal  and prices reached record levels in fiscal these increased prices resulted in significantly improved profitability 
in fiscal  egg prices declined as compared to fiscal  due to slight increases in supply 
in fiscal  egg prices continued to decline as compared to fiscal  due to continued increases in industry supply 
egg sales at the retail level were good  and while there was modest improvement in food service and restaurant sales  overall  there is continued weakness in food service and restaurant sales 
for fiscal our feed costs decreased  as compared to feed costs in fiscal fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  net sales 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales consisted of shell egg sales and approximately was for sales of egg products  with the balance consisting of sales of incidental feed and feed ingredients 
net sales for the fiscal year ended may  were million  a decrease of million  or  from net sales of million for fiscal in fiscal total dozens of eggs sold increased and egg selling prices decreased as compared to fiscal in fiscal total dozens of shell eggs sold were million  an increase of million dozen  or  compared to million sold in fiscal our average selling price of shell eggs decreased from per dozen for fiscal to per dozen for fiscal  a decrease of

our net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs  including non graded shell egg sales  breaking stock and undergrades 
our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which are outside of our control 
small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices

capital expenditure requirements are expected to be for the normal repair and replacement of our facilities 
we are constructing a new integrated layer production complex in farwell  texas to replace our albuquerque  new mexico complex  which ceased egg production in fiscal the facility was expected to cost approximately million  and was estimated to be complete in january as of may   capital expenditures related to construction of this complex were approximately million including replacement capital expenditures related to the fire mentioned below 
on july   the farwell  texas egg production complex was damaged by a fire 
the acre facility includes a processing plant  feed mill  two pullet houses  and nine layer houses 
the fire completely destroyed four of the nine layer houses  with additional loss of laying hens at a fifth house due to smoke inhalation 
the company believes the effects of lost production and additional expenses related to the fire will be substantially reimbursed by the company s insurance carriers 
the company has received million in proceeds from its insurance carriers through may  and anticipates additional insurance proceeds to cover its losses due to the fire 
the company intends to seek reimbursement for all of its insured losses  including lost profits and expenses 
the book value of assets written off and expenses incurred  net of amounts reclassified to construction in progress and other assets  as the result of the fire totaled million through may  insurance proceeds have been recognized in the consolidated income statement for fiscal to offset the assets written off and expenses incurred 
no gain  if any  will be recognized until all contingencies surrounding the resolution of the insurance claim are resolved  which is expected to occur in fiscal year the company believes that the fire at the farwell  texas facility will have minimal financial impact on our operations and does not expect any long term disruption to our customers 
construction to rebuild the destroyed houses is substantially complete 
in addition  the company is adding a tenth layer house at the complex which will add capacity above the original design 
due to this casualty and expansion  maximum operations at the farwell facility will likely be delayed to december future capital expenditures will be funded by cash flows from operations and insurance recoveries 
delta egg farm  llc  an unconsolidated affiliate  has constructed an organic egg production and distribution facility near our chase  kansas location 
in connection with this project  we are a pro rata guarantor  with the other delta egg farm  llc owners  of the additional debt that was undertaken to fund construction of this facility 
we are currently a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of delta egg farm  llc 
on august   ubs agreed to a settlement in principle with the securities and exchange commission the sec  the new york attorney general  the massachusetts securities division  the texas state securities board  and other state regulatory agencies represented by the north american securities administrators association to restore liquidity to all remaining ubs clients who hold auction rate securities 
on november   we agreed to accept auction rate security rights the rights from ubs offered through a ubs prospectus dated october  the rights permit us to sell  or put  our auction rate securities back to ubs at par value anytime during the period from june  through july  we have exercised the rights and put our auction rate securities back to ubs on june  by accepting the rights  we can no longer assert that we have the intent to hold the auction rate securities until anticipated recovery 
accordingly  we have classified our investments in auction rate securities as trading securities 
as of the date of our acceptance of the rights  the change in fair value of the auction rate securities and rights are included in earnings 
because we were permitted to put the auction rate securities back to ubs at par value  we have accounted for the rights as a separate asset that is measured at its fair value  resulting in gains in an amount equal to the loss recognized on the auction rate securities 
we have classified the auction rate securities and the related rights as current investments as of may  on june   we put the auction rate securities back to ubs 
the fair value of the auction rate securities and rights totaled million at may  and million at may  at may   we have million of current investment securities available for sale consisting primarily of commercial paper  certificates of deposit  government agency bonds  taxable municipal bonds  variable rate tax exempt municipal bonds  tax exempt municipal bonds  and zero coupon municipal bonds with maturities of three to fifteen months when purchased 
we classified these securities as current  because amounts invested are available for current operations 
due to the nature of the investments  the cost of available for sale securities approximated fair value at may  we currently have a million deferred tax liability due to a subsidiary s change from a cash basis to an accrual basis taxpayer on may  the taxpayer relief act of provides that this liability is payable ratably over the years beginning in fiscal however  such taxes will be due in their entirety in the first fiscal year in which there is a change in ownership control 
we are currently making annual payments of approximately  related to this liability 
however  while these current payments reduce cash balances  payment of the million deferred tax liability would not affect our consolidated statement of income or stockholders equity  as these taxes have been accrued and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
looking forward  we believe that our current cash balances  borrowing capacity  and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our current and projected capital needs 
off balance sheet arrangements the company owns of the membership interests in delta egg farm  llc delta egg 
the company is a guarantor of of delta egg s long term debt  which totaled approximately million at may  delta egg s long term debt is secured by substantially all of the fixed assets of delta egg and is due in monthly installments through fiscal delta egg is engaged in the production  processing  and distribution of shell eggs 
the other owner also guarantees of the debt 
the guarantee arose when delta egg borrowed funds to construct its production and processing facility in the guarantee would be required if delta egg is not able to pay the debt 
management of the company believes that payment under the guarantee will be unlikely because delta egg is now well capitalized 
on july   this debt was refinanced for a term of ten years 
there were additional borrowings under this refinancing due to the construction of an organic egg production and distribution facility near chase  kansas costing approximately million

total over years long term debt operating leases total impact of recently issued accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that establishes the fasb accounting standards codification asc as the single source of authoritative us gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities and modifies the us gaap hierarchy to only two levels authoritative and non authoritative 
this guidance became effective for interim periods and fiscal years ending after september  the company adopted the provisions of the guidance in the second quarter of fiscal the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  or asu the amendments in this update replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement in variable interest entities  which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures asc topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the amendments in this update require new disclosures about transfers into and out of levels fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and fair value determined based on significant other observable inputs  and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
except for the detailed level roll forward disclosures  the new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the requirement to provide detailed disclosures about the purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued an accounting standards update which amends certain implementation issues related to an entity s requirement to perform and disclose subsequent events procedures 
the new guidance clarifies that management must evaluate  as of each reporting period  events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date through the date that the financial statements are issued 
management must perform its assessment for both interim and annual financial reporting periods 
this guidance exempts sec filers from disclosing the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and is effective immediately for financial statements that are issued or available to be issued 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas which was codified primarily in asc topic  business combinations asc 
sfas changes the accounting for noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements  requires noncontrolling interests to be reported as part of equity and changes the income statement presentation of income or losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests 
we adopted sfas as of may   as required 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management suggests that our summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  generally for amounts more than days past due 
inventories 
inventories of eggs  feed  supplies and livestock are valued principally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower  we would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value 
the cost associated with flock inventories  consisting principally of chick purchases  feed  labor  contractor payments and overhead costs  are accumulated during the growing period of approximately weeks 
capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the productive lives of the flocks  generally one to two years 
flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal adjustments to write down flock inventories 
management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss 
long lived assets 
depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations 
we continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
investment in affiliates 
we have invested in other companies engaged in the production  processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from less than to
