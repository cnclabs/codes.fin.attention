item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our financial condition at december  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires us to establish policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in our judgment  the accounting policies  estimates and assumptions described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of specialty pharmaceutical products primarily eye care pharmaceuticals  skin care and urologics products to wholesalers within the united states  and we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
a portion of our revenue is generated from consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at physician  hospital and clinic locations 
these customers are contractually obligated to maintain a specific level of inventory and to notify us upon the use of consigned inventory 
revenue for consigned inventory is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been used 
notification is usually through the replenishing of the inventory  and we periodically review consignment inventories to confirm the accuracy of customer reporting 
we generally offer cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables 
those discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded 
the amounts reserved for cash discounts were million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for cash discounts deducted from consolidated sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we permit returns of product from most product lines by any class of customer if such product is returned in a timely manner  in good condition and from normal distribution channels 
return policies in certain international markets and for certain medical device products  primarily breast implants  provide for more stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of product returns matched against sales  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
the amount of allowances for sales returns recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and were million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other accrued expenses and trade receivables  net in our consolidated balance sheets 
see note  composition of certain financial statement captions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
provisions for sales returns deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in the amount of allowances for sales returns at december  compared to december  and the provision for sales 
table of contents returns in compared to are primarily due to increased sales returns related to breast implant products  additional provisions for returns related to the genericization in the united states of certain eye care pharmaceutical products and a small increase in estimated product return rates for our other specialty pharmaceuticals products 
the increase in the provision for sales returns in compared to is primarily due to the overall increase in net sales in compared to historical allowances for cash discounts and product returns have been consistent with the amounts reserved or accrued 
we participate in various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs  the largest of which relates to medicaid  medicare and the department of veterans affairs 
sales rebate and other incentive programs also include contractual volume rebate programs and chargebacks  which are contractual discounts given primarily to federal government agencies  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefits managers and group purchasing organizations 
we also offer rebate and other incentive programs for our aesthetic products and certain therapeutic products  including botox cosmetic  juv derm  latisse  acuvail and restasis  and for certain skin care products 
sales rebates and incentive accruals reduce revenue in the same period that the related sale is recorded and are included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in the amounts accrued at december  compared to december  and the provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs in compared to are primarily due to an increase in the number of incentive programs offered and an increase in activity under previously established incentive programs  principally related to our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox cosmetic  skin care and facial aesthetics products 
the increase in the provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs in compared to is primarily due to an increase in us sales of products subject to managed care and contractual volume rebate and incentive programs  principally eye care pharmaceuticals  botox and obesity intervention products  as well as an increase in sales of our aesthetic products subject to our rebate and incentive programs 
in addition  an increase in our published list prices in the united states for pharmaceutical products  which occurred for several of our products in both and  generally results in higher provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales 
our procedures for estimating amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at the end of any period are based on available quantitative data and are supplemented by management s judgment with respect to many factors  including but not limited to  current market dynamics  changes in contract terms  changes in sales trends  an evaluation of current laws and regulations and product pricing 
quantitatively  we use historical sales  product utilization and rebate data and apply forecasting techniques in order to estimate our liability amounts 
qualitatively  management s judgment is applied to these items to modify  if appropriate  the estimated liability amounts 
there are inherent risks in this process 
for example  customers may not achieve assumed utilization levels  customers may misreport their utilization to us  and actual movements of the us consumer price index for all urban consumers  or cpi u  which affect our rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies  may differ from those estimated 
on a quarterly basis  adjustments to our estimated liabilities for sales rebates and other incentive programs related to sales made in prior periods have not been material and have generally been less than of consolidated product net sales 
an adjustment to our estimated liabilities of of consolidated product net sales on a quarterly basis would result in an increase or decrease to net sales and earnings before income taxes of approximately million to million 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
additionally  there is a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated liability and when we actually pay the liability 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated liabilities over several periods  which can result in a net increase to earnings or a net decrease to earnings in those periods 
material differences may result in the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales if the actual amount of rebates and incentives differ materially from the amounts estimated by management 

table of contents we recognize license fees  royalties and reimbursement income for services provided as other revenues based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement 
in general  we recognize income upon the signing of a contractual agreement that grants rights to products or technology to a third party if we have no further obligation to provide products or services to the third party after entering into the contract 
we defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed 
pensions we sponsor various pension plans in the united states and abroad in accordance with local laws and regulations 
our us pension plans account for a large majority of our aggregate pension plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations 
in connection with these plans  we use certain actuarial assumptions to determine the plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations  the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
our assumption for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our us funded pension plan for determining the net periodic benefit cost is for  which is the same rate used for and our assumptions for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our non us funded pension plans are  and for  and  respectively 
for our us funded pension plan  we determine  based upon recommendations from our pension plan s investment advisors  the expected rate of return using a building block approach that considers diversification and rebalancing for a long term portfolio of invested assets 
our investment advisors study historical market returns and preserve long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in a manner consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
they also evaluate market factors such as inflation and interest rates before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
for our non us funded pension plans  the expected rate of return was determined based on asset distribution and assumed long term rates of return on fixed income instruments and equities 
market conditions and other factors can vary over time and could significantly affect our estimates of the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected rate of return is applied to the market related value of plan assets 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in our rate of return on assets assumptions for our us and us funded pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit cost by approximately million 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and non us pension benefit obligations at december  were and  respectively  and at december  were and  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and us net periodic benefit costs for were and  respectively  for  and  respectively  and for  and  respectively 
we determine the discount rate based upon a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with maturities that mirror the pension benefit obligations at the plans measurement date 
market conditions and other factors can vary over time and could significantly affect our estimates for the discount rates used to calculate our pension benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for future years 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the discount rate assumption for our us and us pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit costs by approximately million and increase our pension plans projected benefit obligations at december  by approximately million 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of share based awards is estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period using the straight line single option method 
the fair value of modifications to share based awards is generally estimated using a lattice model 

table of contents the determination of fair value using the black scholes and lattice option pricing models is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we currently estimate stock price volatility based upon an equal weighting of the historical average over the expected life of the award and the average implied volatility of at the money options traded in the open market 
we estimate employee stock option exercise behavior based on actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
share based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest  and we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
these estimates will be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of lower tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions  research and development  or r d  tax credits available in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions and deductions available in the united states for domestic production activities 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained  which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate  including factors such as the mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the recognition or derecognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions  expected utilization of r d tax credits and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
changes in the valuation allowances  when they are recognized in the provision for income taxes  are included as a component of the estimated annual effective tax rate 
in february  the california legislature enacted budget legislation containing various california tax law changes including an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula for taxable years beginning on or after january  we anticipate making the election and as a result  the state and federal deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were re determined during the first quarter of to reflect an adjustment to the resulting tax rate 
the impact of the adjustment was an increase to the provision for income taxes of million 
we have not provided for withholding and us taxes for the unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have currently reinvested these earnings indefinitely in these foreign operations 
at december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
income tax expense would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
upon remittance  certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available  subject to certain limitations  for use as credits against our us tax liability  if any 
we annually update our estimate of unremitted earnings outside the united states after the completion of each fiscal year 

table of contents purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
on july   we acquired a stockholder interest in a joint venture  samil allergan ophthalmic joint venture company  or samil  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
on july   we acquired all assets relating to aczone dapsone gel  a topical treatment for acne vulgaris  for approximately million 
on october   we acquired esprit pharma holding company  inc  or esprit  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
on february   we acquired endoart sa  or endoart  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
on january   we acquired groupe corn al laboratoires  or corn al  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
we accounted for the acquisitions of samil  esprit  endoart and corn al as business combinations 
we accounted for the aczone acquisition as a purchase of net assets and not as a business combination 
the purchase prices for the acquisitions were allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates 
the determination of estimated fair values requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows  and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
impairment evaluations for goodwill and purchased intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist  by comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value 
we have two reporting units  specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices  and historically performed our evaluation as of january of each year 
in july  we changed the timing of our annual impairment testing for goodwill from january to october of each year as a preferable method of accounting 
accordingly  we performed a second annual impairment assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of we decided to adopt this change in timing in order to assess the recorded values of goodwill for potential impairment at a time closer to our fiscal year end reporting date 
we believe this change is preferable in reducing the potential risk that an undetected impairment indicator could occur in between the timing of our annual impairment test and the preparation of our year end financial statements 
this change has no effect on reported earnings for any current or prior periods 
we primarily use the income approach and the market approach to valuation that include the discounted cash flow method  the guideline company method  as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
upon completion of the january and october annual impairment assessments  we determined that no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each of the two reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value 
as of december   we do not believe any significant indicators of impairment exist for our goodwill that would require additional analysis before our next annual evaluation 
our medical device products are primarily based on consumer choice and have limited reimbursement by government or other health care plans 
the negative global economic environment and related decline in consumer spending that began in and continued into resulted in a decline in the sales and profitability of our medical device products in compared to although the estimated fair value of the medical devices segment exceeded its carrying value by at october   the date of our latest annual impairment test  the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value has declined from our previous evaluations 
if the 
table of contents profitability of the medical devices segment continues to decline and does not meet our profitability and cash flow expectations in and strategic future profitability and cash flow expectations beyond  there could be a potential future impairment of goodwill for our medical devices segment 
one of the most important assumptions used in our valuation models to estimate the fair value of the medical devices segment is the amount of promotion  selling and marketing expenses required to maintain future projected net sales 
as a sensitivity measure  a one percentage point increase in the assumed ratio to net sales for promotion  selling and marketing expenses beginning in and extending through the entire strategic valuation period beyond would cause an approximate percentage point decrease in the excess amount of estimated fair value over carrying value for the medical devices segment 
we also review purchased intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment in the carrying value of an intangible asset is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an intangible asset are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
we did not record any impairment charges in in  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million for an intangible asset related to the phase out of a collagen product 
in february  we announced a restructuring plan to focus our sales efforts on the urology specialty market and to seek a partner to promote sanctura xr to general practitioners  which resulted in a significant reduction in our urology sales force 
in september  we announced a co promotion agreement with quintiles transnational corp  or quintiles  under which quintiles will promote sanctura xr to general practitioners in the united states 
in our valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our developed technology intangible asset related to sanctura xr  we analyzed estimated future net sales and cash flows with and without a long term partner to promote sanctura xr to general practitioners 
under both scenarios  the estimated fair value of the developed technology intangible asset exceeded its carrying value as of december  the excess of estimated fair value under the scenario assuming no long term partner to promote sanctura xr to general practitioners exceeded the carrying value by approximately million 
the combined total amount of intangibles and a related million prepaid royalty asset subject to the impairment evaluation at december  is million 
if the actual estimated future net sales  operating expenses and cash flows differ significantly from our expectations  there could be a potential future impairment of the sanctura xr developed technology asset 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in our impairment evaluations 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur future impairment charges 
discontinued operations on july   we completed the sale of the ophthalmic surgical device business that we acquired as a part of the corn al acquisition in january  for million 
the net assets of the disposed business consisted of current assets of million  non current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
we recorded a pre tax loss of million million net of tax associated with the sale 
the following amounts related to the ophthalmic surgical device business have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations through the date of disposition 
we did not account for our ophthalmic surgical device business as a separate legal entity 
therefore  the following selected financial data for the discontinued operations is presented for informational purposes only and does not necessarily reflect what the net sales or earnings would have been had the business operated as a stand alone entity 
the financial information for the discontinued operations includes allocations of certain expenses to the ophthalmic surgical device business 
these amounts have been allocated to the discontinued operations on the basis that is considered by management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to  or the benefit obtained by  the ophthalmic surgical device business 

table of contents the following table sets forth selected financial data of our discontinued operations for selected financial data for discontinued operations in millions product net sales loss from discontinued operations before income taxes loss from discontinued operations continuing operations headquartered in irvine  california  we are a multi specialty health care company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing innovative pharmaceuticals  biologics and medical devices that enable people to live life to its greatest potential to see more clearly  move more freely and express themselves more fully 
our diversified approach enables us to follow our research and development into new specialty areas where unmet needs are significant 
we discover  develop and commercialize specialty pharmaceutical  medical device and over the counter products for the ophthalmic  neurological  medical aesthetics  medical dermatology  breast aesthetics  obesity intervention  urological and other specialty markets in more than countries around the world 
we are a pioneer in specialty pharmaceutical research  targeting products and technologies related to specific disease areas such as chronic dry eye  glaucoma  retinal disease  psoriasis  acne  movement disorders  neuropathic pain and genitourinary diseases 
additionally  we are a leader in discovering  developing and marketing therapeutic and aesthetic biological  pharmaceutical and medical device products  including saline and silicone gel breast implants  dermal fillers and obesity intervention products 
at december   we employed approximately  persons around the world 
our principal markets are the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
results of continuing operations we operate our business on the basis of two reportable segments specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
the specialty pharmaceuticals segment produces a broad range of pharmaceutical products  including ophthalmic products for glaucoma therapy  ocular inflammation  infection  allergy and chronic dry eye  botox for certain therapeutic and aesthetic indications  skin care products for acne  psoriasis  eyelash growth and other prescription and over the counter skin care products  and urologics products 
the medical devices segment produces a broad range of medical devices  including breast implants for augmentation  revision and reconstructive surgery  obesity intervention products  including the lap band system and the orbera intragastric balloon system  and facial aesthetics products 
we provide global marketing strategy teams to coordinate the development and execution of a consistent marketing strategy for our products in all geographic regions that share similar distribution channels and customers 
management evaluates our business segments and various global product portfolios on a revenue basis  which is presented below in accordance with gaap 
we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measure of constant currency sales 
constant currency sales represent current period reported sales  adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year 
we calculate the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported sales  calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year  to the actual current period reported sales 
we routinely evaluate our net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of our sales 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower  respectively  than growth reported at actual exchange rates

b other medical devices sales primarily consist of sales of ophthalmic surgical devices pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement entered into as part of the sale of the former corn al ophthalmic surgical device business in the third quarter of  which was substantially concluded in the fourth quarter of product net sales product net sales increased by million in compared to due to an increase of million in our specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales  partially offset by a decrease of million in our medical devices product net sales 
the increase in specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales is due to sales increases in our eye care pharmaceutical and skin care product lines  partially offset by small decreases in our botox and urologics product lines 
the decrease in medical devices product net sales reflects a decrease in product net sales across all of our medical device product lines 
net sales were negatively affected by a general weakening of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar in the foreign countries where we operated during compared to several of our products  including botox cosmetic  and our facial aesthetics  obesity intervention and breast implant products  are purchased based on consumer choice and have limited reimbursement or are not reimbursable by government or other health care plans and are  therefore  partially or wholly paid for directly by the consumer 
we believe the negative economic environment and related decline in consumer spending that began in the second half of and continued into had a negative effect on our sales  operations and profitability in if negative economic conditions continue to prevail during  we believe there could be a corresponding negative effect on our sales  operations and profitability in 
table of contents in the second half of and early in  the us dollar strengthened significantly compared to certain foreign currencies of countries where we operate 
the foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and these currencies that prevailed in negatively affected our net sales in compared to if the us dollar strengthens against these currencies in  our net sales could be negatively affected in compared to recently  the us congress proposed significant reforms to the us health care system 
both the us senate and house of representatives have proposed major health care reform measures  some of which include increases in medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and annual  non deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports certain prescription drugs  biologics or medical devices offered for sale in the united states 
at this time  we cannot predict which or whether any of these reform measures will be adopted into law 
furthermore  we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by potential legislative or regulatory developments  and our sales  operations and profitability could be negatively affected if the regulations are enacted 
eye care pharmaceuticals product net sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong growth in sales of restasis  our therapeutic treatment for chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of combigan  our alphagan and timolol combination for the treatment of glaucoma  an increase in sales of ganfort  our lumigan and timolol combination for the treatment of glaucoma  an increase in sales of alphagan p  our most recent generation of alphagan for the treatment of glaucoma and an increase in new product sales of acuvail  our advanced  preservative free formulation of ketorolac  which we launched in the united states in the third quarter of  partially offset by lower sales of our glaucoma drugs alphagan and alphagan p  lower sales of our non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs acular and acular ls and a small decline in sales in dollars of artificial tears products 
generic formulations of alphagan  alphagan p  acular and acular ls had a negative effect on our sales of these products in we estimate the majority of the increase in our eye care pharmaceuticals sales was due to an overall net increase in the volume of product sold and a shift in sales mix to a greater percentage of higher priced products  partially offset by the negative impact on our international product net sales from a general weakening of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar 
during  we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states 
effective january   we increased the published us list price for combigan  lumigan and zymar by five percent  alphagan p  alphagan p  acular and acular ls by eight percent  and elestat by seven percent  and effective january   we increased the published list price in the united states for restasis by five percent 
effective april   we increased the published us list price of acular and acular ls by an additional nine percent  and effective may   we increased the published us list price of alphagan p by an additional eight percent 
effective august   we increased the published us list price of alphagan p  acular and acular ls by an additional eight percent and alphagan p by an additional five percent 
effective october   we increased the published us list price of combigan  lumigan and restasis by an additional five percent and zymar by an additional seven percent 
these price increases had a positive net effect on our us sales for compared to  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars  although we are unable to determine the impact of these effects 
botox product net sales decreased slightly in compared to primarily due to the negative impact of a general weakening of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar on our international botox sales and a decrease in sales of botox cosmetic in the united states  partially offset by an increase in sales of botox for therapeutic use in the united states and an increase in sales of botox cosmetic in asia pacific and latin america 
we believe sales of botox  primarily botox cosmetic  were negatively impacted in by declines in consumer spending in most of our principal geographic markets and by the introduction of a competitive product in the united states 
based on internal information and assumptions  we estimate in that botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and grew at a rate of 
table of contents approximately compared to in  botox cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and decreased by approximately compared to we believe our worldwide market share for neuromodulators  including botox  is currently approximately 
skin care product net sales increased in compared to primarily due to new product sales of latisse  our treatment for hypotrichosis  or inadequate eyelashes  which we launched in the united states in january  and sales of aczone  which we launched in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a decrease in sales of tazorac  zorac and avage  our topical tazarotene treatments for acne and psoriasis 
net sales of tazorac  zorac and avage decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in we increased the published us list price for tazorac  zorac and avage by approximately ten percent effective january  and an additional nine percent effective october  urologics product net sales  which are presently concentrated in the united states and consist primarily of our sanctura franchise products for the treatment of overactive bladder  or oab  decreased in compared to net sales of our sanctura franchise products decreased million to million in compared to million in in february  we announced a restructuring plan to focus our sales efforts on the urology specialty market and to seek a partner to promote sanctura xr  our once daily anticholinergic for the treatment of oab  to general practitioners  which resulted in a significant reduction in our urology sales force 
in september  we announced a co promotion agreement with quintiles  under which quintiles will promote sanctura xr to general practitioners in the united states 
we increased the published us list price for sanctura xr by fourteen percent effective january  and by an additional seven percent on october  we increased the published us list price for sanctura  our twice a day anticholinergic for the treatment of oab  by eight percent effective january   by an additional nine percent on june  and by an additional nine percent on october  we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our specialty pharmaceutical products at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our specialty pharmaceutical products was near the lower end of our stated policy levels 
breast aesthetics product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of silicone gel and saline breast implants and tissue expanders  decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in sales in the united states  europe  and latin america  partially offset by a small increase in sales in asia pacific 
the decline in sales of breast aesthetics products in the united states was primarily due to lower unit volume  partially offset by the transition from lower priced saline products to higher priced silicone gel products 
we believe that sales of our breast aesthetics products were negatively impacted in by declines in consumer spending in all of our principal geographic markets 
obesity intervention product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of devices used for minimally invasive long term treatments of obesity such as our lap band and lap band ap systems  decreased in compared to primarily due to decreases in sales in the united states and most of our other principal geographic markets 
our orbera intragastric balloon system sales grew strongly on a small sales base 
we believe sales of obesity intervention products in the united states and other principal geographic markets were negatively impacted in by declines in consumer spending given substantial patient co pays 
facial aesthetics product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of hyaluronic acid based and collagen based dermal fillers used to correct facial wrinkles  decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in sales in the united states and europe 
the decrease in net sales of facial aesthetics products was partially offset by an increase in sales in asia pacific  latin america and canada  primarily due to the launch of juv derm ultra with lidocaine in those markets 
we believe sales of facial aesthetics products were negatively impacted in by declines in consumer spending in all of our principal geographic markets 
sales of facial aesthetics products were also negatively affected by a general decline in sales of older generation collagen based dermal fillers 

table of contents foreign currency changes decreased product net sales by million in compared to  primarily due to the weakening of the euro  uk pound  brazilian real  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
us product net sales as a percentage of total product net sales increased by percentage points to in compared to us sales of in  due primarily to an increase in u 
s skin care net sales and an increase in us sales of eye care pharmaceuticals as a percentage of total eye care pharmaceutical net sales  partially offset by a decline in us product net sales as a percentage of total product net sales for botox and our medical device product lines 
a significant portion of the increase in us sales as a percentage of total product net sales in compared to is related to the general weakening of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar in countries where we operate 
product net sales increased by million in compared to due to the combined result of an increase of million in our specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales and an increase of million in our medical devices product net sales 
the increase in specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales reflects growth across all of our specialty pharmaceutical product lines 
the increase in medical devices product net sales reflects growth across all of our core medical device product lines  partially offset by a decrease in other ophthalmic surgical medical device product net sales 
net sales were also positively affected by a general strengthening of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar in the foreign countries where we operated during compared to eye care pharmaceuticals sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong growth in sales of restasis  our therapeutic treatment for chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of combigan  primarily due to its launch in the united states in the fourth quarter of  and increased combigan sales in canada  europe  latin america and asia  an increase in sales of ganfort  our lumigan and timolol combination for the treatment of glaucoma  an increase in product net sales of alphagan p  our most recent generation of alphagan for the treatment of glaucoma  an increase in sales of acular ls  our more recent non steroidal anti inflammatory  and growth in sales of artificial tears products  including the refresh and optive brands 
these increases in eye care pharmaceuticals sales were partially offset by lower sales of alphagan p due to a general decline in wholesaler demand resulting from a decrease in promotion efforts and lower sales of elestat  our topical antihistamine used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis 
we estimate the majority of the increase in our eye care pharmaceuticals sales was due to a shift in sales mix to a greater percentage of higher priced products  and an overall net increase in the volume of product sold 
effective january   we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states 
we increased the published us list price for restasis by five percent  lumigan by seven percent  alphagan p and alphagan p by eight percent  acular ls by eight percent  elestat by seven percent and zymar by eight percent 
additionally  effective august   we increased the published list prices in the united states for alphagan p and alphagan p by seven percent  acular ls by six percent and zymar by six percent 
these price increases had a positive net effect on our us sales for compared to  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars  although we are unable to determine the impact of these effects 
botox sales increased in compared to primarily due to growth in demand in international markets and  to a lesser degree  the united states for both cosmetic and therapeutic use 
we believe the rate of growth of botox sales  primarily botox cosmetic  was negatively impacted by declines in consumer spending in the united states and europe in  and botox therapeutic sales were negatively impacted by patients delaying certain treatments due to significant co pays in the united states and by some national and regional governments in europe restricting access to botox due to the crisis in public finances 
effective january   we increased the published price for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states by approximately four percent  which we believe had a positive effect on our us sales growth in  primarily related to sales of botox cosmetic 
in the united states  the actual net effect from the increase in price for sales of botox for 
table of contents therapeutic use is difficult to determine  primarily due to rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies 
international botox sales benefited from strong sales growth for both cosmetic and therapeutic use in europe  latin america and asia pacific 
based on internal information and assumptions  we estimate in that botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and grew at a rate of approximately compared to in  botox cosmetic sales also accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and grew at a rate of approximately compared to skin care sales increased in compared to primarily due to sales of aczone  which we launched in the fourth quarter of  an increase in sales of vivit  a line of physician dispensed skin care products launched in and sales of our clinique medical skin care line  which is marketed in collaboration with clinique  a division of the est e lauder companies  and was launched in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of tazorac  zorac and avage  our topical tazarotene treatments for acne and psoriasis  and lower sales of other physician dispensed creams  including md forte and prevage md 
net sales of tazorac  zorac and avage decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in we increased the published us list price for tazorac  zorac and avage by five percent effective january  in connection with our esprit acquisition in october  we acquired a new product line focused on the urologics market 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize sales of sanctura  esprit s twice a day anticholinergic treatment for oab 
in january  we launched sanctura xr  an improved once daily anticholinergic treatment for oab 
net sales of our sanctura franchise products were million in compared to million in breast aesthetics product net sales increased in compared to primarily due to sales growth in europe  latin america and asia pacific and the rapid transition of the market in north america from lower priced saline products to higher priced silicone gel products since the us food and drug administration  or fda  approval of silicone gel breast implants in november this increase in sales was partially offset by a slight decrease in breast aesthetics product net sales in north america  primarily due to a decline in the number of breast implant units sold in the united states 
we believe the rate of growth in net sales of breast aesthetics products in the united states and europe was negatively impacted in by declines in consumer spending 
obesity intervention product net sales increased in compared to due to strong sales growth rates in canada  the united kingdom  australia and latin america and a low rate of sales growth on a large sales base in the united states 
we believe the rate of growth in net sales of obesity intervention products was negatively impacted in by the introduction of a competitive product in the united states and by declines in consumer spending in the united states 
facial aesthetics product net sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong sales growth in europe and canada  primarily due to the launch of juv derm ultra with lidocaine in those markets  and sales growth in the united states  latin america and asia pacific

the decline in other revenues was partially offset by an increase in royalty income due primarily to sales of brimonidine products by alcon  inc in the united states under a licensing agreement  and sales of lumigan in japan by senju pharmaceutical co  ltd

the restructuring plan also included modest workforce reductions in other functions as we re engineered our processes to increase efficiency and productivity 
as part of the restructuring plan  we modified the outstanding stock options issued in our february full round employee stock option grant 
the stock options were originally granted with an exercise price of with a standard four year graded vesting term  a ten year contractual term  and standard day expiration upon termination of employment provisions

because the modified awards became fully vested and there was no future derived service period  all unamortized compensation expense related to the original grant and the additional compensation expense attributable to the modification of the awards was recognized in full on the modification date 
in addition  the contractual provisions of outstanding stock options  other than the february full round employee stock option grant  held by employees impacted by the workforce reduction were modified to extend the stock option expiration dates

under the modified terms  stock options for the impacted employees will expire after the earlier of three years from termination of employment or the remaining contractual term 
all unamortized compensation expense related to the original stock option awards plus the incremental compensation expense associated with the modifications will be recognized ratably from the modification date to the employees expected termination date

table of contents at december   we had a committed long term credit facility  a commercial paper program  a medium term note program  an unused shelf registration statement that allows us to issue additional securities  including debt securities  in one or more offerings from time to time  a real estate mortgage and various foreign bank facilities 
our committed long term credit facility expires in may the termination date can be further extended from time to time upon our request and acceptance by the issuer of the facility for a period of one year from the last scheduled termination date for each request accepted 
the committed long term credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million 
the commercial paper program also provides for up to million in borrowings 
borrowings under the committed long term credit facility and medium term note program are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  maximum leverage ratios 
certain covenants also limit subsidiary debt 
we believe we were in compliance with these covenants at december  at december   we had no borrowings under our committed long term credit facility  million in borrowings outstanding under the medium term note program  million in borrowings outstanding under the real estate mortgage  million in borrowings outstanding under various foreign bank facilities and no borrowings under the commercial paper program 
commercial paper  when outstanding  is issued at current short term interest rates 
additionally  any future borrowings that are outstanding under the long term credit facility will be subject to a floating interest rate 
we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt 
at december   we had net pension and postretirement benefit obligations totaling million 
future funding requirements are subject to change depending on the actual return on net assets in our funded pension plans and changes in actuarial assumptions 
in  we expect to pay pension contributions of between million and million for our us and us pension plans and between million and million for our other postretirement plan 
on january   we completed the acquisition of serica technologies  inc  a medical device company focused on the development of biodegradable silk based scaffolds for use in tissue regeneration  including breast augmentation  revision and reconstruction and bariatric applications  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
a significant amount of our existing cash and equivalents are held by non us subsidiaries 
we currently plan to use these funds in our operations outside the united states 
withholding and us taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have reinvested these earnings indefinitely in such operations 
at december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax costs would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our current expected obligations  working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years and at the end of  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our product net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as 
table of contents a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as we deem appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was a decrease of million in and an increase of million and million in and  respectively 
the sales decrease included million related to the euro  million related to the uk pound  million related to the brazilian real  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the mexican peso  million related to the australian dollar and million related to other latin american and asian currencies

see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules  for a description of our accounting policy on foreign currency translation

in determining the minimum required funding  we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in management s judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated 
where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of local statutory requirements  additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules  for activities relating to interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

table of contents to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents  interest expense on our debt as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts 
on january   we entered into a nine year  two month interest rate swap with a million notional amount with semi annual settlements and quarterly interest rate reset dates 
the swap receives interest at a fixed rate of and pays interest at a variable interest rate equal to month libor plus  and effectively converts million of the million aggregate principal amount of our notes to a variable interest rate 
based on the structure of the hedging relationship  the hedge meets the criteria for using the short cut method for a fair value hedge 
the investment in the derivative and the related long term debt are recorded at fair value 
at december  and  we recognized in our consolidated balance sheets an asset reported in investments and other assets and a corresponding increase in long term debt associated with the fair value of the derivative of million and million  respectively 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the notes 
during  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  as a reduction of interest expense due to the differential to be received 
in february  we entered into interest rate swap contracts based on month libor with an aggregate notional amount of million  a swap period of years and a starting swap rate of 
we entered into these swap contracts as a cash flow hedge to effectively fix the future interest rate for our notes 
in april  we terminated the interest rate swap contracts and received approximately million 
the total gain is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over a year period to match the term of the notes 
as of december   the remaining unrecognized gain  net of tax  of million is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense  including the effect of the million notional amount of the interest rate swap entered into on january   would increase or decrease by approximately million 
commercial paper  when outstanding  is issued at current short term interest rates 
additionally  any future borrowings that are outstanding under the long term credit facility will be subject to a floating interest rate 
therefore  higher interest costs could occur if interest rates increase in the future

table of contents foreign currency risk overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated revenues or operating costs and expenses as expressed in us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management to focus its attention on our core business issues 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed months 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
all of our outstanding foreign currency option contracts are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily earnings denominated in the canadian dollar  mexican peso  australian dollar  brazilian real  euro and korean won 
current changes in the fair value of open foreign currency option contracts are recorded through earnings as unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments  net while any realized gains losses on settled contracts are recorded through earnings as other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings
