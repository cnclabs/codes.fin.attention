readers are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
in addition  we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
although we believe that the assumptions on which the forward looking statements contained herein are based are reasonable  any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate  and as a result  the forward looking statements based upon those assumptions also could be incorrect 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this report 
in addition to the historical information contained herein  the discussions in this report may contain forward looking statements that may be affected by risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in item a  risk factors 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the following amounts are in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
business overview the business of bioanalytical systems  inc is largely dependent on the level of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies efforts in new drug discovery and approval 
our services segment is the direct beneficiary of these efforts  through outsourcing by these companies of research work 
our products segment is the indirect beneficiary  as increased drug development leads to capital expansion providing opportunities to sell the equipment we produce and the consumable supplies we provide that support our products 
developments within the industries we serve have a direct  and sometimes material  impact on our operations 
currently  many large pharmaceutical companies have major block buster drugs that are nearing the end of their patent protections 
this puts significant pressure on these companies both to develop new drugs with large market appeal  and to re evaluate their cost structures and the time to market of their products 
contract research organizations cro s have benefited from these developments  as the pharmaceutical industry has turned to out sourcing to both reduce fixed costs and to increase the speed of research and data development necessary for new drug applications 
the number of significant drugs that have reached or are nearing the end of their patent protection has also benefited the generic drug industry 
that sector of the drug industry has seen significant growth in the past decade  and  we believe  will continue to experience strong growth in the foreseeable future 
generic drug companies provide a significant source of new business for cro s as they develop  test and manufacture their generic compounds 
a significant portion of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is now being driven by biotech and small  venture capital funded  drug development companies 
many of these companies are single molecule entities  whose success depends on one innovative compound 
while several of the biotech companies have reached the status of major pharmaceuticals  the industry is still characterized by smaller entities 
these developmental companies generally do not have the resources to perform much of the research within their organizations  and are therefore dependent on the cro industry for both their research and for guidance in preparing their fda submissions 
these companies have provided significant new opportunities for the cro industry  including us 
they do  however  provide challenges in selling  as they frequently have only one product in development  which causes cro s to be unable to develop a flow of projects from a single company 
these companies may expend all their available funds and cease operations prior to fully developing a product 
additionally  the funding of these companies is subject to investment market fluctuations  which changes with changes to the risk profile and appetite of investors 
research services are capital intensive 
the investment in equipment and facilities to serve our markets is substantial and continuing 
while our physical facilities are adequate to meet market needs for the near term  rapid changes in automation  precision  speed and technologies necessitate a constant investment in equipment and software to meet market demands 
we are also impacted by the heightened regulatory environment and the need to improve our business infrastructure to support our increasingly diverse operations  which will necessitate additional capital investment 
our ability to generate capital to reinvest in our capabilities  both through operations and financial transactions  is critical to our success 
while we are currently committed to fully utilizing recent additions to capacity  sustained growth will require additional investment in future periods 
our financial position could limit our ability to make such investments 
in contrast to fiscal  there were several announcements of large mergers in the pharmaceutical industry in fiscal pfizer inc and eli lilly and co 
have both announced significant acquisitions 
also  merck and roche have recently announced mergers with schering plough and genentech  respectively 
we believe that such merger and consolidation activity reduced the demand and increased competition for cro services in fiscal and was a distraction for the research and development arms of these companies as they await finalization of new drug development portfolios 
the additional competitive pressures could adversely affect our future operating results 
our primary market  the contract research organization cro market  is experiencing serious economic pressures 
since the end of our fiscal year  pharmaceutical development companies have delayed the initiation of cro studies and reduced their total spending for cro services 
we believe these actions are largely in response to the global economic recession and related financial crisis 
the delays and reductions in spending by our customers resulted in a significant negative impact on our revenues for fiscal as compared to our prior fiscal year 
however  the number of new studies initiated by our customers increased during our third fiscal quarter ended june  and continued through the end of the current fiscal year 
executive overview our revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of industries and clients 
as a result  we closely monitor the market for our services 
in fiscal  we experienced lower demand for our products and services  high cancellation rates and significant project delays 
we believe this was primarily due to the current general economic conditions and the global financial crisis  increased competition  and consolidation of several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  which delayed decisions on research and development spending 
despite these conditions and uncertainties about the level of and delays in r d spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  we continue to believe in the fundamentals of the market and that it will rebound in future periods 
for fiscal  we plan to focus on sales execution  operational performance and building strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we review various metrics to evaluate our financial performance  including period to period changes in new orders  revenue  margins and earnings 
in fiscal  we had new authorizations of million  a decrease of over the same period in likewise in fiscal  our overall revenues declined approximately versus the prior fiscal year 
gross margin and earnings declined as well from prior year 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue  margins  earnings and other financial results for the fiscal year ended september   see results of operations compared to below 
as of september   we had of cash and cash equivalents as compared to of cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal in fiscal  we generated  in cash from continuing operations 
our accounts receivable and unbilled revenues balances decreased  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in sales  offset slightly by efforts to collect outstanding receivables 
we plan to continue to monitor accounts receivable and the various factors that affect it  including contract terms  the mix of contracts performed and our success in collecting receivables 
we will also continue to limit unnecessary spending  and freeze current wage rates for the foreseeable future to control costs and maintain cash 
results of operations the following table summarizes the condensed consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations year ended september  service revenue product revenue total revenue cost of service revenue a cost of product revenue a total cost of revenue gross profit total operating expenses operating income loss other expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss from continuing operations a percentage of service and product revenues  respectively 
compared to service and product revenues overall  our services and product revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the us and european economic recession 
revenues for the year ended september  declined to  compared to  for the year ended september  our services revenue declined to  compared to  for the prior year primarily as a result of lower bioanalytical analysis and toxicology revenues 
our bioanalytical analysis revenues decreased  a decline from fiscal  mainly due to study delays by clients and decreases in new bookings 
our west lafayette facility experienced the majority of the decline in bioanalytical analysis revenues  or  likewise  our toxicology revenues declined from our prior fiscal year by  or 
study delays and cancellations contributed to the decline for the toxicology group as well 
sales in our products segment decreased from  to  when compared to the same period in the prior year 
the majority of that decrease stems from lower sales of our culex automated in vivo sampling systems  which declined to  from  this decline stems mainly from the reduction in research and development and capital spending by our customers as part of their overall cost savings initiatives 
although our revenues for the current fiscal year were less than our prior fiscal year  our revenues increased in the second half of the current fiscal year from the first half 
this increase is the result of increased proposal opportunities and acceptance rates since january  compared to the last six months of calendar resulting from the efforts of our sales and marketing department  which was reorganized in the first quarter of fiscal cost of revenue cost of revenue for the year ended september  was  or of revenue compared to  or of revenue for the comparable prior period 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue increased to in the current fiscal year from in the prior year 
the principal cause of this increase was the decline in sales 
a significant portion of our costs of productive capacity in the service segment are fixed 
thus  decreases in revenues lead to increases in costs as a percentage of revenue 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue in the current fiscal year increased from to 
the increase in the percentage was mainly due to an increase in our periodic charges for inventory obsolescence of this was the result of higher charges in the current fiscal year for products that were discontinued 
operating expenses selling expenses for the year ended september  decreased by to  from  for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in salary expense resulting from the reduction in work force and other departures  lower commissions due to the decline in sales and reduced spending on marketing expenditures 
also  accelerated amortization of in fiscal  related to the abandonment of unused patents  resulted in lower amortization expense in fiscal research and development expenses for the year ended september  decreased to from for the year ended september  the decrease was partially due to a decrease in salaries from the reduction in work force as well as reduced spending on temporary labor and operating supplies 
general and administrative expenses for the current year decreased to  from  for the prior year 
a decline in salaries and hourly wages from the january reduction in force contributed to the reduction in expenses in the current fiscal year as well as strict controls on other variable expenses 
other income expense other income expense  net  was  for the year ended september  as compared to for the year ended september  this increase is due to additional borrowings on our line of credit  causing higher interest expense and lower interest income year over year 
income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended september  was compared to for the prior year period 
in fiscal  a valuation allowance was set up against the entire us deferred income tax balance  adjusting the rate from to 
in fiscal  we recorded an additional expense of for uncertain tax positions and incurred taxes on domestic income from which we could not deduct the loss from our uk facility 
we also did not provide income taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal or due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards to offset our taxable income  which have not previously been recognized for financial statement purposes due to the uncertainty of future utilization 
discontinued operations on june   we sold the operating assets of our baltimore clinical pharmacology research unit cpru to algorithme pharma usa inc ap usa and algorithme pharma holdings inc 
algorithme for a cash payment of  and the assumption of certain liabilities related to the cpru 
as a result  we exited the market for phase i first in human clinical studies 
we remain contingently liable for annually through for future financial obligations under the cpru facility lease 
for further detail  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
accordingly  in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  we segregated the results of the cpru as discontinued operations for our fiscal year 
the loss from discontinued operations reflects the results of operations of the cpru until disposal in fiscal the remaining estimated cash expenditures related to this unit were recorded as current liabilities of discontinued operations  since they were paid within fiscal year these expenditures relate mostly to normal operating expenses 
the current assets of discontinued operations relate mostly to outstanding customer receivables for completed clinical trials that were collected in fiscal liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis since inception  our principal sources of cash have been cash flow generated from operations and funds received from bank borrowings and other financings 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of compared to at september  net cash provided by continuing operating activities was  for the year ended september   compared to  for the year ended september  the decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities in the current fiscal year primarily results from a decrease in earnings from continuing operations as well as a decrease in customer advances of  these items were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of  as a result of the decline in sales and a decrease in refundable income taxes of due to the receipt of federal and state income tax refunds 
included in operating activities for fiscal are non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization  recorded to reflect the fair value of our interest rate swaps  for impairment of goodwill for our uk operations and for employee stock option expense 
the impact on operating cash flow of other changes in working capital was not material 
the decline in cash generated from operations  which is our primary source of cash  relates to our current operating loss 
we experienced an operating loss in fiscal as compared to operating income in the prior year as a result of an approximate year to date decrease in sales  significantly reducing our cash flow from operations 
the decline in sales was due to both a decrease in new bookings and delays by sponsors on projects previously booked 
this negative impact on our cash flow from operations began to slow in our third quarter of fiscal as our revenues began to increase 
total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal of  represent the highest revenues of any quarter in fiscal likewise  revenues in the second half of fiscal increased approximately  or over the first half of the current fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative costs in the first half of fiscal included one time costs  such as severance for employees  recruiting fees for replacing former officers and marketing and advertising costs associated with our new marketing plan and branding 
these increased costs did not continue into the second half of fiscal compared to the first half of fiscal  selling and general and administrative costs decreased  or  in the second half of the current fiscal year 
we expect the reduced spending levels to continue and that our efforts to reduce costs will positively impact fiscal as well 
with respect to compliance with our bank loan covenants  ebitda is computed as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  removing other non cash charges such as stock option expenses and the impairment loss and deducting unfunded capital expenditures 
for the third quarter ended june   we generated positive ebitda for the first time in fiscal this continued into the fourth quarter of fiscal with another positive ebitda quarter 
we also covered our fixed charge coverage ratio for interest  debt and lease amortization for the second half of fiscal  after a period of three fiscal quarters in which we did not 
we believe these improvements helped to enable us to obtain waivers from our banks for loan covenant violations and to amend the covenants for future periods as discussed below 
in january  we completed a reduction in work force impacting all areas of operations  through both attrition and terminations  which reduced our annual compensation expense by approximately 
also  in an effort to reduce operating costs and provide greater financial flexibility  we negotiated a reduction in the base salary of richard m 
shepperd  our ceo 
investing activities used in fiscal mainly due to capital expenditures 
our principal investments were for laboratory equipment replacements and upgrades in all of our facilities as well as general building and information technology infrastructure expenditures at all sites 
the reduction in capital spending from fiscal is a result of our efforts to contain cash commitments throughout the organization  funding only necessary expenditures 
financing activities used  in the current fiscal year as compared to  used for fiscal the main use of cash in fiscal was for long term debt and capital lease payments of  as well as net payments on our line of credit of in fiscal  we repaid the balance of our subordinated debt  approximately  which was partially offset by  of new borrowings  net borrowings on our line of credit of  and long term debt and capital lease payments of  since the acquisition of the baltimore clinic in fiscal  we had consistently experienced negative cash flows from that operation 
with the sale of that operation on june   we eliminated a significant drain on operating cash flows  which should result in improved future liquidity 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations of is mainly due to the collection of outstanding receivables 
capital resources property and equipment spending totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in spending in fiscal is the result of cash savings initiatives  funding only necessary expenditures 
capital spending in fiscal was mainly for tenant improvements on our new lease in the uk facility as well as laboratory equipment financed mainly through capital leases in the west lafayette and evansville  indiana facilities 
capital investments for the purchase of additional laboratory equipment are driven by anticipated increases in research services  and by the replacement or upgrading of our equipment 
although we may consider strategic acquisition opportunities  we do not intend to aggressively pursue additional acquisitions until we fully utilize existing capacity 
we have notes payable to regions aggregating approximately  and a  line of credit with entrepreneur growth capital llc egc  which is subject to availability limitations that may substantially reduce or eliminate our borrowing capacity at any time  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
regions notes payable include three outstanding mortgages on our facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana  which total  two of the mortgages mature in november with an interest rate fixed at  while the other matures in february with an interest rate of 
in addition to the mortgages  we also have a note payable with regions totaling  maturing december  interest on this term loan is equal to 
monthly payments are plus interest 
the loan is collateralized by real estate at our west lafayette and evansville  indiana locations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have interest rate swap agreements with respect to the note payable and a mortgage loan to fix the interest rate at 
we entered into the derivative transactions to hedge interest rate risk of this debt obligation and not to speculate on interest rates 
the fair value of the swaps was determined with a level two analysis 
as a result of recent declines in short term interest rates  the swaps had a negative fair value of at september  and at september   which was recorded in our consolidated financial statements as interest expense and a long term liability 
the terms of the interest rate swaps match the scheduled principal outstanding under the loans 
we do not intend to prepay the loans  and expect the swaps to expire under their terms in two years without payment by us 
upon expiration of the swaps  the net fair value recorded in the consolidated financial statements is expected to be zero 
borrowings under our credit agreements are collateralized by substantially all assets related to our operations and all common stock of our us subsidiaries and of the common stock of our non united states subsidiaries 
under the terms of our credit agreements  we have agreed to restrict advances to subsidiaries  limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures as well as comply with certain financial covenants outlined in the borrowing agreements 
all of these credit agreements contain cross default provisions 
the covenants in our loan agreements with regions require us to maintain certain ratios including a fixed charge coverage ratio and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio 
the regions loans contain both cross default provisions with each other and with the revolving line of credit from egc as described below 
at december  and march   we were not in compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio 
on february   regions waived our violation of our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant through the end of our second fiscal quarter of the current year 
on may   regions amended the computations and requirements for the fixed charge coverage ratios through december  after that date  the computations and requirements for the fixed charge coverage ratio will revert to those in the original agreement 
the amended computations are less restrictive to us 
at september   we were in compliance with the amended fixed charge covenant ratio 
based on projections for fiscal  we expect to be in breach of the regions covenants once the computations and requirements revert to the original agreement after december  on january   regions waived our expected violation of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant through december  on january   regions amended the computations and requirements for the fixed charge coverage ratios through fiscal year revolving line of credit on january   we entered into a new  revolving line of credit agreement credit agreement  with entrepreneur growth capital llc egc  which we intend to use for working capital and other purposes  to replace the national city line of credit that expires on january  borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on our personal property  including certain eligible accounts receivable  inventory and intellectual property assets  and a second mortgage on our west lafayette and evansville real estate 
under the credit agreement  the company has agreed to restrict advances to subsidiaries  limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures and comply with certain financial covenants outlined in the credit agreement 
the initial term of the credit agreement terminates january  but is renewable upon mutual agreement of the parties 
if we prepay prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term  then we are subject to an early termination fee equal to the minimum interest charges for the number of months remaining until expiration 
the covenants in the credit agreement require that we maintain a minimum tangible net worth of  which may restrict the amount we can borrow to fund future operations  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains cross default provisions with the regions loans and any future egc loans 
under the credit agreement borrowings bear interest at an annual rate equal to citibank s prime rate plus five percent with minimum interest of per month 
interest is paid monthly 
the line of credit also carries an annual facilities fee of and a collateral monitoring fee 
based on our current business activities and cash on hand  we expect to borrow on our revolving credit facility in fiscal to finance working capital 
to conserve cash  we instituted a freeze on non essential capital expenditures 
as of september   we had  of total borrowing capacity with the national city line of credit  of which  was outstanding  and of cash on hand 
we had a decrease in our total borrowing capacity of  from  to  from the fiscal year ended september  due to several factors  including the reduction of our maximum available amount from  to  declining sales in fiscal led to a lower accounts receivable balance  which reduces the total borrowing capacity 
as discussed above  the sales decline  which was due to lower new bookings and sponsor delays  began to slow in the third quarter of the current fiscal year 
revenues in the second half of fiscal year increased over the first fiscal half and our accounts receivable balance increased slightly as well 
although the second half revenue and cash flow have shown gains over the first half of fiscal  failure to continue to improve revenue and control expenses could impair our ability to continue operations 
with the decrease in cash flow from operations discussed above  we may face additional situations during fiscal where we are not in compliance with at least one covenant in the credit agreement  requiring that we obtain a waiver at that time 
if that situation arises  we will be required to negotiate with our lending banks again to obtain loan modifications or waivers as described above 
we cannot predict whether our lenders will provide those waivers  if required  what the terms of any such waivers might be or what impact any such waivers will have on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
the following table summarizes the cash payments under our contractual term debt and other obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future fiscal periods amounts in thousands 
the table does not include our revolving line of credit 
additional information on the debt is described in note  debt arrangements 
after total notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases uncertain tax positions we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal on capital assets  primarily laboratory equipment which will be financed using capital leases 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies 
we have identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of our service contracts involve the processing of bioanalytical samples for pharmaceutical companies 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed fee for each assay method developed or sample processed and revenue is recognized under the specific performance method of accounting 
under the specific performance method  revenue and related direct costs are recognized when services are performed 
other service contracts generally consist of preclinical studies for pharmaceutical companies 
service revenue is recognized based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs under the proportional performance method of accounting 
losses on contracts are provided in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which such revisions become known 
the establishment of contract prices and total contract costs involves estimates made by the company at the inception of the contract period 
these estimates could change during the term of the contract which could impact the revenue and costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
projected losses on contracts are provided for in their entirety when known 
revisions to estimates have not been material 
service contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred and classified within customer advances  until earned 
unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings 
product revenue from sales of equipment not requiring installation  testing or training is recognized upon shipment to customers 
one product includes internally developed software and requires installation  testing and training  which occur concurrently 
revenue from these sales is recognized upon completion of the installation  testing and training when the services are bundled with the equipment sale 
long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of related to certain patents  licenses and trademarks that have no revenue generating products 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired  using a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit  as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations  to its book carrying value  including goodwill 
we do not believe that market value is indicative of the true fair value of the company mainly due to average daily trading volumes of less than 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  the implied fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the implied fair value is calculated by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step to all of its assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets and any excess in fair value that is not assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the discount rate and sales growth rates are the two material assumptions utilized in our calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
our three reporting units are west lafayette oregon  evansville and the uk based on the discrete financial information available which is reviewed by management 
we utilize a cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital rate 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used 
due to fiscal year operating losses and lowered expectations for the near future  we performed an impairment test for our uk reporting unit as of june  using the assumptions detailed in the table below 
as a result of this test  we recorded a impairment loss equal to the total value of the uk goodwill 
we performed our annual impairment test for all other reporting units at september  using the following assumptions  which are more conservative than our internal forecasts and operating plans  the fair value of our west lafayette oregon reporting unit is greater than the carrying value by approximately reporting unit west lafayette oregon uk discount rate revenue growth rate in fiscal revenue growth rate each year after fiscal operating expense reduction in fiscal operating expense increase each year after fiscal considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted sales growth rates and our cost of capital or discount rate  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the assumptions used in our impairment testing could be adversely affected by certain of the risks discussed in risk factors in item a of this report 
there have been no significant events since the timing of our impairment tests that have triggered additional impairment testing 
at september   remaining recorded goodwill was  and the net balance of other intangible assets was stock based compensation we recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
we measure compensation cost for all share based awards based on estimated fair values and recognize compensation over the vesting period for awards 
we recognized stock based compensation related to stock options of and during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
we use the binomial option valuation model to determine the grant date fair value 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award 
generally  our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes 
we estimated the following key assumptions for the binomial valuation calculation risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use our historical stock price volatility on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
we assumed that we will pay no dividends 
employee stock based compensation expense recognized in fiscal and was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment will be recognized at that time 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the binomial option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future grants of equity could significantly impact compensation expense recognized in future periods 
income tax accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions  according to asc  income taxes 
under asc  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that we believe is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position 
at the end of fiscal a liability for uncertain income tax positions existed under asc this reserve is classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
interest and penalties are included in this reserve 
see note for additional information 
any changes in the liability for uncertain tax positions would impact our effective tax rate 
over the next twelve months  it is reasonably possible that the uncertainty surrounding our reserve for uncertain income tax positions  which relate to certain state income tax issues  will be resolved upon the conclusion of state tax audits 
accordingly  if such resolutions are favorable  we would reduce the carrying value of our reserve 
we have an accumulated net deficit in our uk subsidiaries  consequently  united states deferred tax assets on such earnings have not been recorded 
also  a valuation allowance was established in fiscal against the us deferred income tax balance 
we had previously recorded a valuation allowance on the uk subsidiary deferred income tax balance 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo cost method of accounting 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the sec announced that it will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with ifrs international financial reporting standards 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the iasb international accounting standards board 
under the proposed roadmap  we could be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs beginning in fiscal the sec has indicated it will make a determination in regarding mandatory adoption of ifrs 
in april  the fasb issued an accounting pronouncement under asc extending the disclosure requirements regarding the fair value of financial instruments 
asc requires disclosures in interim reporting periods and in financial statements for annual reporting periods regarding the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not on the company s balance sheet
