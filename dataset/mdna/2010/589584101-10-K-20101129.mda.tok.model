results of operations fourth quarter net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased to  or per diluted share  from net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal of  or per diluted share 
this decrease primarily reflects decreased sales coupled with transaction costs related to the acquisition of the bioline group  or per diluted share 
the effects of these factors were partially offset by the management of discretionary spending and the resulting decreases in research development and selling marketing expenses 
sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal were  a decrease of  or  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal sales for the us diagnostics operating segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  reflecting decreased sales in our c 
difficile product family  along with the impact on of the novel a hn influenza outbreak and the abrupt halt of the outbreak in december fourth quarter sales for our european diagnostics operating segment decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  while  as a result of the bioline group acquisition  sales for our life science segment experienced a increase in sales during this period

table of contents fiscal year net earnings for fiscal decreased to  or per diluted share from net earnings for fiscal of  or per diluted share 
net earnings for fiscal include  or per diluted share  of bioline group transaction costs 
results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal are discussed below 
non gaap information the tables below provide information on net earnings  basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share  excluding the effect of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of the bioline group  as well as reconciliations to amounts reported under us generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that this information is useful to those who read our financial statements and evaluate our operating results because these measures help to appropriately evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the impact of one time transaction costs related to the acquisition of the bioline group  and these measures are used by our management for various purposes  including evaluating performance against incentive bonus achievement targets  comparing performance from period to period in presentations to our board of directors  and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting

table of contents revenue overview our diagnostics operating segments provide the largest share of our consolidated revenues   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
sales from our four focus families c 
difficile  h 
pylori  foodborne and upper respiratory comprised of our diagnostics operating segments revenues during fiscal overall revenue change for fiscal for our diagnostics operating segments was a negative  largely due to a relatively mild worldwide flu season in fiscal compared to  including the effects of the world wide outbreak of novel a hn influenza  which primarily occurred during fiscal further contributing to the year over year sales decline was the fact that sales of our c 
difficile family of products continued to be negatively impacted by significant competitive pressures and ongoing confusion surrounding the various testing methods  factors which we believe will be countered by our recently introduced illumigene molecular c 
difficile product 
partially offsetting the effects of the declines in these products were sales increases in our h 
pylori and foodborne family of products of and  respectively  compared to fiscal on an organic basis  our european diagnostic operating segment s sales declined in fiscal  due in large part to significant competitive pressures on sales of our c 
difficile product 
this compared to growth in the segment s organic sales during fiscal  which was driven by volume increases in upper respiratory related to the novel a hn influenza outbreak 
c 
difficile products during the third quarter of fiscal  we launched our illumigene molecular c 
difficile product in non us markets  and launch of the product into us markets followed in the fourth quarter of  upon receiving fda clearance 
as a result  we currently have approximately customer accounts and others that are evaluating our illumigene molecular c 
difficile product 
we expect sales of the product  which totaled in  to grow significantly in fiscal as a result of competitive pressures in this disease family over the last several years from new competitive products  including molecular assays  during fiscal we experienced declines in the sales of our c 
difficile products 
sales of c 
difficile products decreased for both of our diagnostics operating segments during fiscal  compared to a decline in fiscal the c 
difficile market also continues to experience considerable confusion around the relative benefits of the various test methods available toxin testing  antigen testing and molecular testing 
with the launch of our molecular product  we believe we are in a unique position to offer a full line of testing solutions to our clinical laboratory customers around the world to counter the competitive pressures surrounding this market 

table of contents upper respiratory products during fiscal  upper respiratory sales for our diagnostics operating segments decreased compared to fiscal  following a year over year increase from fiscal to fiscal this dramatic sales fluctuation for this family of products was driven by the abrupt halt  in december  of the outbreak of the novel a hn influenza virus that began to spread across countries in the northern hemisphere during the second half of fiscal the novel a hn influenza outbreak created an early start to the influenza season  resulting in increased upper respiratory sales for influenza products in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal this outbreak also created an increased interest in influenza testing in european markets where rapid testing has not been traditionally performed  resulting in significant revenue growth in fiscal  which  similar to us markets  has declined in fiscal at present  significant seasonal influenza activity has yet to emerge  and we do not expect a significant revenue contribution from these products in fiscal foodborne products during fiscal  sales of our foodborne products increased approximately for our us diagnostics operating segment and approximately for our european diagnostics operating segment on an organic basis 
as was experienced in fiscal  the revenue increases in this product family continues to reflect the volume growth in our new foodborne products launched over the last few years immunocard stat ehec in fiscal  and premier tm campy and immunocard stat campy in fiscal 
the volume growth from these new products has more than doubled the global revenues for this disease family since fiscal  and this is now approaching a  product family 
this disease family is expected to generate significant sales growth in fiscal h 
pylori products during fiscal  sales of our h 
pylori products grew for our us diagnostics operating segment and for our european diagnostics operating segment on an organic basis  compared to the year over year sales level increases these operating segments experienced in of and  respectively 
the increases for our us diagnostics operating segment continue to reflect the benefits of our partnerships with managed care companies in promoting the health and economic benefits of a test and treat strategy  and the fact that such a strategy is beginning to move physician behavior away from serology based testing to direct antigen testing 
the modest levels of growth for our european diagnostics operating segment reflect the ongoing impact of pricing pressures from competitive products in european markets 
group purchasing organizations in our us diagnostics operating segment  consolidation of the us healthcare industry over the last several years has led to the creation of group purchasing organizations gpos that aggregate buying power for hospital groups and put pressure on our selling prices 
we have multi year supply agreements with several gpos 
during fiscal  we experienced approximately  in unfavorable price variance  as a result of these agreements 
however  these agreements help secure our products with these customers and have led to new business 
while in the near term this has negatively impacted gross profit  further increases in volumes are expected from these contracts 

table of contents foreign currency currency translation had virtually no impact on the fiscal consolidated sales results  compared to resulting in  of currency translation losses in fiscal and  of gains in fiscal life science operating segment excluding the impact of our july acquisition of the bioline group  sales for our life science operating segment increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  including bioline group sales 
this increase largely reflects buying patterns of our two largest diagnostic manufacturing customers  who accounted for of the life science operating segment s sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal excluding the impact of bioline group transaction costs and the bioline group s results since the date of acquisition  we experienced a improvement in the operating income contribution of this operating segment in fiscal compared to fiscal significant customers our us diagnostic operating segment s sales through two distributors were of the us diagnostics operating segment s total sales  or of consolidated sales  for fiscal this compares to fiscal  in which sales through these distributors comprised of us diagnostics operating segment sales and of consolidated sales 
our life science operating segment s sales of purified antigens and reagents to two customers were of the life science operating segment s total sales for fiscal or of our consolidated sales for fiscal  compared to and of fiscal life science operating segment and consolidated sales  respectively 
operating segment revenues our reportable operating segments are us diagnostics  european diagnostics and life science 
the us diagnostics operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of europe  africa and the middle east 
the european diagnostics operating segment consists of the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in europe  africa and the middle east 
the life science operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee  saco  maine  boca raton  florida  london  england  luckenwalde  germany  and sydney  australia  and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies  pcr qpcr reagents  nucleotides  competent cells and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad 
the life science operating segment also includes the contract development and manufacture of proteins and other biologicals for use by biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in research for new drugs and vaccines 

table of contents revenues for the diagnostics operating segments  in the normal course of business  may be affected by buying patterns of major distributors  seasonality and strength of certain diseases  and foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues for the life science operating segment  in the normal course of business  may be affected by the timing and nature of arrangements for contract services work  which may have longer production cycles than bioresearch reagents and bulk antigens and antibodies  as well as buying patterns of major customers 
we believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues

manufacturing efficiency improvements at our memphis  tennessee facility also contributed to year over year improvements in gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal gpo contracts also impacted our gross profit margins during fiscal these contracts provide customers with favorable pricing based on purchase volume commitments of meridian products 
during fiscal  we experienced approximately  in unfavorable price variance  as a result of these agreements 
however  these agreements help secure our products with these customers and have led to new business 
while in the near term this has negatively impacted gross profit  further increases in volumes are expected from these contracts 

table of contents our overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats  as well as bioresearch reagents  bulk antigens and antibodies  proficiency panels  and contract research and development and contract manufacturing services 
product sales mix shifts  in the normal course of business  can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points 
operating expenses general administrative research selling and transaction total operating development marketing costs expenses expenses of sales fiscal increases decreases us diagnostics european diagnostics life science expenses of sales increase decrease fiscal increases decreases us diagnostics european diagnostics life science expenses of sales increase decrease operating expenses for the us diagnostics operating segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal and increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal the overall net decrease in fiscal reflected the combined effects of i decreased research and development spending as a result of completing the development of our molecular illumigene c 
difficile product  which was launched during fiscal  and comparatively higher clinical trial costs for certain immunoassay products in  ii decreased sales and marketing expenses due to lower c 
difficile and upper respiratory product sales resulting in lower bonus and commission costs for our sales organization  and iii increased general and administrative expenses as a result of higher compensation costs  including stock based compensation costs related to time vested restricted stock granted in november the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to illumigene c 
difficile development costs  additional salaries and benefits related to planned headcount additions and increased marketing and clinical trial expenses related to new products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased stock based compensation and decreased corporate incentive bonus related to earnings levels for fiscal 
table of contents operating expenses for the european diagnostics operating segment increased for fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal the fiscal decrease was primarily attributable to currency fluctuations 
operating expenses for the life science operating segment increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in resulted primarily from increased salaries and benefits related to filling open positions  increased research and development resource allocations  the addition of the bioline group s operating expenses of  and the bioline group transaction costs  which were  the fiscal decrease was primarily attributable to reduced salaries and benefits related to lower headcount 
the amount of stock based compensation expense reported for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
during november and november  we granted to certain employees stock options and restricted stock that were contingent upon meridian achieving a specified net earnings level for each fiscal year 
because meridian s fiscal net earnings did not reach the minimum level in or  these awards were not earned 
no stock based compensation has been recorded for these awards 
similarly  in november  we granted restricted shares and restricted units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted shares or restricted units vesting in total in four years  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal dividends were paid on these shares throughout fiscal while the earnings target was not met  on september   the compensation committee of the board of directors chose to convert the performance based restricted shares to time vested restricted shares vesting in total after four years in recognition of the achievement in of several strategic initiatives that position the company for future growth 
expense totaling was recorded in fiscal as a result of this conversion  and is included in the total amount of stock based compensation set forth above 
operating income operating income decreased and increased in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 

table of contents other income and expense interest income was  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases during fiscal and fiscal were primarily driven by lower interest yields due to a higher concentration of investments in money market funds in fiscal and lower interest rates in the current interest rate environment 
fiscal interest earnings were also impacted by the use of cash to acquire the bioline group early in the fourth quarter 
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to the non deductible nature of bioline group transaction costs and the expiration of the federal research and experimentation tax credit effective december  impact of inflation to the extent feasible  we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact our gross margin  revenue or operating income in fiscal  or liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis our cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets  consideration of acquisition plans  and consideration of common share dividends 
we have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities 
this credit facility has been supplemented by the proceeds from a september common share offering  which during most of fiscal  were invested in a non interest bearing bank deposit account  overnight repurchase agreements  institutional money market mutual funds and until their sale during the third quarter of fiscal  tax exempt auction rate securities 
we used  from our investment portfolio to complete the acquisition of the bioline group 
we have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio 
our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to i preserve capital  ii provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions  and iii capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy s investment eligibility criteria 
as a result of conditions in the financial markets  we have chosen to keep the maturity of our investment portfolio very short 
as we look forward  we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective 

table of contents during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold all of our investment in student loan auction rate securities to ubs ag via our auction rate security rights  and received par value of  plus accrued interest 
except as otherwise described herein  we do not expect current conditions in the financial markets  or overall economic conditions to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs  financial condition  or results of operations 
we intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities 
we also have additional sources of liquidity through our investment portfolio and  bank credit facility  if needed 
to date  we have not experienced any significant deterioration in the aging of our customer accounts receivable nor in our vendors ability to supply raw materials and services and extend normal credit terms 
our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and or liquidity and credit within the financial markets remains tight for an extended period of time  and such conditions impact the collectability of our customer accounts receivable  or impact credit terms with our vendors  or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services 
fluctuations in overall stock market valuations may raise questions as to the potential impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
our annual goodwill impairment review takes place as of june th each year 
there have been no impairments from these annual reviews 
as of november   our stock price was per share  compared to our book value per share of as of september  this relationship  stock price trading at x book value  is an indicator that the fluctuation in overall stock market valuations and its impact on our stock price has not been a triggering event for impairment of our goodwill and other long lived assets 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales and earnings levels  timing of payments with suppliers and the effect of the bioline group s operations 
net cash used for investing activities was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the bioline group and increased purchases of property  plant and equipment in fiscal  partially offset by cash received from the third quarter sale of our student loan auction rate securities 
net cash used for financing activities was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in dividend payments and a decrease in proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
dividend payments in fiscal reflect increased dividend rates and common shares outstanding related to stock option exercises 
net cash flows from operating activities are anticipated to fund working capital requirements and dividends during the next twelve months 

table of contents capital resources we have a  credit facility with a commercial bank which expires september  as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
we did not have any borrowing under this facility during fiscal or our capital expenditures are estimated to range between approximately  to  for fiscal  with the actual amount depending upon actual operating results and the phasing of certain projects 
such expenditures may be funded with cash and equivalents on hand  operating cash flows  and or availability under the  credit facility discussed above 
capital expenditures relate to manufacturing and other equipment of a normal and recurring nature  as well as costs associated with production line automation in cincinnati  facilities expansions in cincinnati and memphis  computer system and software purchases for the bioline group  and instrumentation to support the illumigene product launch 
known contractual obligations known contractual obligations and their related due dates were as follows as of september  less than more than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations uncertain income tax positions liability and interest total meridian and its subsidiaries are lessees of i office and warehouse buildings in cincinnati  boston  florida  australia  belgium  france  holland  germany and the uk  ii automobiles for use by the diagnostic direct sales forces in the us and europe  and iii certain office equipment such as facsimile machines and copier machines across all business units  under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates 
meridian s purchase obligations are primarily outstanding purchase orders for inventory and service items 
these contractual commitments are not in excess of expected production requirements over the next twelve months 
as of september   our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties were and  respectively 
due to inherent uncertainties in the timing of settlement of tax positions  we are unable to estimate the timing of the effective settlement of these obligations 

table of contents other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements license agreements meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to approximately  in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the us diagnostics operating segment 
meridian entered into a license agreement in october with a third party that provides rights to a molecular technology for infectious disease testing in the united states  europe and other geographic markets 
the agreement  as amended during fiscal  calls for remaining payments of up to approximately  based on the achievement of certain product development milestones and on going royalties once products are available for commercial sale 
payments made during product development are expected to occur over a five year period  which began in fiscal since entering into this agreement  we have made payments totaling derivative financial instruments prior to february   we managed exchange rate risk related to forecasted intercompany sales denominated in the euro currency through the use of forward exchange contracts 
we designated such forward contracts as cash flow hedges 
as such  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument was reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings 
as of september   we had no such contracts outstanding 
during january  notional amount of these contracts were settled in accordance with their original maturities 
the realized gain on these contracts was also during january  we accelerated the settlement of the remaining  notional amount of forward exchange contracts that were originally scheduled to mature between february  and december  these transactions resulted in a gain of approximately that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal we unwound these forward exchange contracts after completing a strategic review of our foreign currency exposures 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents market risk exposure foreign currency risk we have market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our european distribution operations where the billing currency is the euro for most of our customers in these markets 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk related to the supply of certain diagnostic test kits by manufacturers located in germany and spain 
these foreign currency risks are opposite one another  providing a natural hedge with respect to consolidated gross profit and operating income 
additionally  as a result of the recent bioline group acquisition  we are exposed to foreign currency risks related to the bioline group s operations in australia australian dollar  germany euro  and the uk british pound 
assessing foreign currency exposures is a component of our overall ongoing risk management process  with such currency risks managed as we believe appropriate 
concentration of customers products risk our us diagnostic operating segment s sales through two distributors were of the us diagnostics operating segment s total sales or of consolidated sales for fiscal three internally developed products  premier tm platinum hpsa plus  premier tm toxins a b  and immunocard toxins a b  accounted for of our us diagnostics operating segment s third party sales during fiscal these same three products accounted for of our european diagnostics operating segment s third party sales and of our consolidated sales for fiscal our life science operating segment s sales of purified antigens and reagents to two customers were of the life science operating segment s total sales for fiscal or of our consolidated sales for fiscal our life science operating segment has four other significant customers who purchase antigens  antibodies and reagents  which together comprised of the operating segment s total sales for fiscal critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling our products 
we estimate rebate accruals based on data provided by these distributors  estimates of inventories of our products held by these distributors  historical statistics  current trends and other factors 
changes to these rebate accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 

table of contents life science revenue for contract services may come from standalone arrangements for process development and or optimization work contract research and development services or custom manufacturing  or multiple deliverable arrangements that include process development work followed by larger scale manufacturing both contract research and development services and contract manufacturing services 
revenue is recognized based on the nature of the arrangements  with each of the multiple deliverables in a given arrangement having distinct and separate customer pricing 
pricing is often subject to a competitive bidding process 
contract research and development services may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
for contract manufacturing services  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
in some cases  customers may request that we store on their behalf clinical grade biologicals that we produce under contract manufacturing agreements 
these cases arise when customers do not have clinical grade storage facilities or do not want to risk contamination during transport 
for such cases  revenue may be recognized on a bill and hold basis pursuant to the satisfaction of criteria in sec staff accounting bulletins nos 
and related to bill and hold revenue recognition 
inventories our inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we establish reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates these reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions were to be less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and recorded in the period known 
such adjustments would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
intangible assets our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from these analyses 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
there were no events or circumstances in fiscal  or indicating that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 

table of contents our ability to recover intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
management is required to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies  and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  impairment of intangible assets could take place 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes our provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
we prepare estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of our tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in our italian subsidiary are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiary 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
we believe that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid locally in italy 

table of contents from time to time  our tax returns in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
to the extent that adjustments result from the completion of these examinations or the lapsing of statutes of limitation  they will affect tax liabilities in the period known 
we believe that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition or results of operation 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this amended guidance enables companies to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit in certain circumstances 
accounting standards codification subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
the subtopic addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amended guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  or our fiscal year we do not expect any impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position when this amended guidance is adopted
