item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents properties description of real property 
the locations of our hospitals and the number of licensed beds at each hospital at december  are set forth in the table beginning on page at december   our subsidiaries also owned or leased and operated medical office buildings  most of which are adjacent to our general hospitals 
we are currently seeking to sell up to of these medical office buildings  totaling approximately million square feet of rental space 
our corporate headquarters are located in dallas  texas 
we have other corporate administrative offices in anaheim  california  coral springs  florida  and philadelphia  pennsylvania 
one of our subsidiaries leases our corporate headquarters space under an operating lease agreement that expires in december other subsidiaries lease the space for our offices in anaheim  coral springs and philadelphia under operating lease agreements 
we believe that all of our properties  including the administrative and medical office buildings described above  are suitable for their intended purposes 
obligations relating to real property 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding loans secured by property and equipment  and we had approximately million of capital lease obligations 
in addition  from time to time  we lease real property to third party developers for the construction of medical office buildings 
under our current practice  the financing necessary to construct the medical office buildings encumbers only the leasehold and not our fee interest in the real estate 
in years past  however  we have at times subordinated our fee interest and allowed our property to be pledged as collateral for third party loans 
we have no contractual obligation to make payments on these third party loans  but our property could be subject to loss in the case of default by the lessee 
regulations affecting real property 
we are subject to a number of laws and regulations affecting our use of  and purchase and sale of  real property 
among these are california s seismic standards  the americans with disabilities act ada  and various environmental laws and regulations 
the state of california has established standards intended to ensure that all hospitals in the state withstand earthquakes and other seismic activity without collapsing or posing the threat of significant loss of life 
in general  we are required to meet these standards by december   subject to a two year extension for hospital projects that are underway in advance of that date 
in november  the california building standards commission adopted regulations permitting the use of a new computerized evaluation tool for determining how at risk hospital buildings are of collapse in an earthquake  and the use of this new tool has resulted in fewer hospitals requiring retrofitting by the deadline 
we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations  of which approximately million was spent prior to january  our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than certain previous estimates because a number of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using the new evaluation tool 
there may be further reductions to our estimated seismic costs as the state of california has recently enacted new regulations relating to the seismic evaluation tool and the new state building code  we are currently evaluating these new regulations to determine what impact they will have on our cost estimate 
our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for future inflation 
in addition to safety standards  over time  hospitals must also meet performance standards meant to ensure that they are generally capable of providing medical services to the public after an earthquake or other disaster 
ultimately  all general acute care hospitals in california must meet seismic performance standards by to remain open 
to date  we have conducted engineering studies and developed compliance plans for all of our california facilities 
at this time  all of our general acute care hospitals in california are in compliance with all current seismic requirements 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public accommodations  including hospitals and other health care facilities  be made accessible to disabled persons 
certain of our facilities are subject to a negotiated consent decree involving disability access as a result of a class action lawsuit 
in accordance with the terms of the consent decree  our facilities have agreed to implement disability access improvements  but have not admitted that they have engaged in any wrongful action or inaction 
to date  we have spent approximately million on corrective work at our facilities  and we expect to spend a total of approximately million on such improvements over the next six years 
our properties are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations  including with respect to asbestos abatement and the treatment of underground storage tanks  among other matters 
we believe it is unlikely that the cost of complying with such laws  rules and regulations will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 

table of contents medical staff and employees general 
our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of individual hospitals 
under state laws and other licensing standards  hospital medical staffs are generally self governing organizations subject to ultimate oversight by the hospital s local governing board 
members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also often serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us 
members of our medical staffs are free to terminate their affiliation with our hospitals or admit their patients to competing hospitals at any time 
although we operate some physician practices and  where permitted by law  employ some physicians  the overwhelming majority of the physicians who practice at our hospitals are not our employees 
however  nurses  therapists  lab technicians  facility maintenance workers and the administrative staffs of hospitals normally are our employees 
we are subject to federal minimum wage and hour laws and various state labor laws  and maintain a number of different employee benefit plans 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians in all specialties on our medical staffs 
although we had a net overall gain in physicians added to our medical staffs in each of the last three years  in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives  including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
we continue to take steps to successfully attract and retain key employees  qualified physicians and other health care professionals 
one of our initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
in general  the loss of some or all of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified physicians and other health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on patient volumes and  thereby  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   the approximate number of our employees of which approximately were part time employees was as follows general hospitals and related health care facilities administrative offices total includes employees whose employment related to the operations of our general hospitals  critical access facility  long term acute care hospital  outpatient surgery centers  diagnostic imaging centers  occupational and rural health care clinics  physician practices  in house collection agency and other health care operations in both continuing and discontinued operations 
at december   the largest concentrations of our employees excluding those in our administrative offices  but including those at our general hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were in those states where we had the largest concentrations of licensed hospital beds of employees of licensed beds california florida texas union activity and labor relations 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were represented by labor unions 
labor relations at our facilities generally have been satisfactory 
we  and the hospital industry in general  are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
we expect this trend to be even more pronounced in  as we renegotiate our existing labor contracts  all of which are scheduled to expire in the next months 
as union activity increases  our operating expenses may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues 
in addition  legislation has been introduced in congress that could significantly change both union organizing and bargaining over initial labor contracts in a way that is likely to increase union membership  at least in the short term 
we are unable to predict what action congress or the president might take with respect to this or any other labor related legislation or the impact such legislation might ultimately have on our relations with employees and unions 
we currently have labor contracts and collective bargaining agreements with the california nurses association cna  the service employees international union seiu  the united nurses associations of california unac and the american federation of state  county and municipal employees that cover registered nurses  service and maintenance workers  and other employees at of our general hospitals in california  three of our general hospitals in florida and one of our general hospitals in philadelphia 
all of these union agreements set stable and competitive wage increases within our budgeted expectations through various dates in and early in january  we commenced the process of renegotiating these contracts  beginning with our collective bargaining agreements with unac at two of our hospitals in california 

table of contents we also have separate peace accords with both the cna and the seiu that provide each union with limited access to attempt to organize certain of our employees and establish specific guidelines for the parties to follow with respect to organizing activities 
both peace accords expire in december such agreements have become more common as employers attempt to balance the disruption caused by traditional union organizing with the rights of employees to determine for themselves whether to seek union representation 
the cna and the seiu have engaged in union organizing activities at several of our hospitals in houston  memphis and philadelphia pursuant to the terms of the peace accords 
registered nurses at two of these facilities have participated in elections concerning cna representation  but to date union organizing has been successful at only cypress fairbanks medical center cyfair 
after extended collective bargaining negotiations over an initial contract for cyfair  the cna triggered an agreed to interest arbitration process  which began in june  that provides for a neutral third party to mediate unresolved contract terms 
if the mediation is unsuccessful  those unresolved terms will be decided by binding arbitration 
we are also defending various allegations that we are in violation of federal labor laws or the terms of our collective bargaining agreements and peace accords  and we expect to continue to be subject to such claims from time to time in the normal course of business 
shortage of experienced nurses and mandatory nurse staffing ratios 
in addition to union activity  factors that adversely affect our labor costs include the nationwide shortage of experienced nurses and the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios 
like others in the health care industry  we continue to experience a shortage of experienced nurses in certain key specialties and geographic areas 
in addition  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
we continually monitor our nurse staffing ratios in california in an effort to achieve full compliance with the state mandated nurse staffing ratios there 
nurse staffing ratio legislation has been proposed in  but not yet enacted by  congress and other states besides california in which we operate hospitals  including florida and pennsylvania 
in  texas passed the hospital safe staffing law  which mandates the creation of nurse staffing committees at texas hospitals and outlines each hospital s responsibility to adopt  implement and enforce an official nurse staffing plan  but does not mandate staffing ratios 
also in  the missouri department of health and senior services published amendments to the state s hospital nursing services regulations  which became effective on june   that are similar to the new texas requirements with respect to nurse staffing 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of nursing personnel  but we expect to continue to experience salary  wage and benefit pressures created by the shortage of experienced nurses throughout the country and state mandated nurse staffing ratios  particularly in california 
in response  we have increased our efforts to recruit and retain experienced nurses and also to address workforce development with local schools of nursing 
we expect that of our hospitals will participate in the versant tm rn residency program in by providing an to week residency program for new nursing school graduates to help ease the transition from student to professional practicing nurse  give nurses evidence based experience and skills needed to increase their competency and confidence  reduce first year nurse turnover and decrease the use of contract labor 
competition in general  competition among health care providers occurs primarily at the local level 
a hospital s position within the geographic area in which it operates is affected by a number of competitive factors  including  but not limited to the scope  breadth and quality of services a hospital offers to its patients and physicians  the number  quality and specialties of the physicians who admit and refer patients to the hospital  nurses and other health care professionals employed by the hospital or on the hospital s staff  the hospital s reputation  its managed care contracting relationships  its location  the location and number of competitive facilities and other health care alternatives  the physical condition of its buildings and improvements  the quality  age and state of the art of its medical equipment  its parking or proximity to public transportation  the length of time it has been a part of the community  and the charges for its services 
in addition  tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
we also face increasing competition from physician owned specialty hospitals and freestanding diagnostic and imaging centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 

table of contents overall  our general hospitals and other health care businesses operate in highly competitive environments 
although we have seen some improvements in recent quarters  we have experienced declines in patient volumes over the last several years 
we believe these declines can be attributed  in part  to increased competition for physicians and patients 
we continue to take steps to address competition and increase patient volumes  however  due to the concentration of our hospitals in california  florida and texas  we may not be able to mitigate some factors that contribute to volume declines 
broadly speaking  we attract physicians by striving to equip our hospitals with technologically advanced equipment and quality physical plant  properly maintaining the equipment and physical plant  providing high quality care to our patients and otherwise creating an environment within which physicians prefer to practice 
one of our specific initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
we have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals  which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes 
we have also sought to include all of our hospitals and an increased number of our affiliated physicians in the affected geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts  which should result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks 
in addition  we have completed clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve our operating results 
this targeted growth initiative has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations  which have had a slightly negative impact on our volumes 
however  the elimination of these unprofitable service lines will allow us to focus more resources on services that are in higher demand and are more profitable 
our commitment to quality initiative is further helping position us to competitively meet the volume challenge 
we continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care 
as a result of these efforts  our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
in our continuing efforts to improve our clinical outcomes and drive down our costs of care  we launched our medicare performance initiative in this initiative is focused on the identification and reduction of costs associated with variations in physician and hospital practices 
the project includes the dissemination of best practices based on evidence based medicine  which we expect will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay  as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients 
we believe that quality of care improvements will continue to have the effect of increasing physician and patient satisfaction  potentially improving our volumes 
further  each hospital has a local governing board  consisting primarily of community members and physicians  that develops short term and long term plans for the hospital to foster a desirable medical environment for physicians 
each local governing board also reviews and approves  as appropriate  actions of the medical staff  including staff appointments  credentialing  peer review and quality assurance 
while physicians may terminate their association with our hospitals at any time  we believe that by striving to maintain and improve the quality of care at our hospitals and by maintaining ethical and professional standards  we will attract and retain qualified physicians with a variety of specialties 
health care regulation and licensing certain background information health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
changes in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government health care programs  hospital cost containment initiatives by public and private payers  proposals to limit payments and health care spending  and industry wide competitive factors greatly impact the health care industry 
the industry is also subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  physician relationships  addition of facilities and services  and reimbursement rates for services 
the laws  rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex  and  in certain areas  the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance 
although we have extensive policies and procedures in place to facilitate compliance in all material respects with such laws  rules and regulations  if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents both federal and state government agencies continue heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts against the health care industry 
under the authority of the inspector general act of  the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs on an annual basis conducts a comprehensive work planning process to identify the areas most worthy of attention in the coming year 
in recent years  the oig has allocated approximately of its resources to reviews and investigations of the medicare and medicaid programs and to hhs public health and human services programs 
in its fiscal year work plan  the oig set forth detailed information about  among other things  its ongoing and planned work examining the integrity of medicare and medicaid payments and services  including payments made to and services provided by hospitals 
an online version of the work plan is available at http oig

gov publications docs workplan work plan fy pd f 
we believe that we  and the health care industry in general  will continue to be subject to increased government scrutiny and investigations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
health care providers are also subject to qui tam lawsuits under the federal false claims act 
qui tam or whistleblower actions can also be filed under certain state false claims laws if the fraud involves medicaid funds or funding from state and local agencies 
federal and state false claims laws allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government  alleging that a hospital or health care provider has defrauded a federal or state government program  such as medicare or medicaid 
if the government intervenes in the action and prevails  the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties for each false claim submitted to the government 
as part of the resolution of a qui tam case  the party filing the initial complaint may share in a portion of any settlement or judgment 
if the government does not intervene in the action  the qui tam plaintiff may continue to pursue the action independently 
although companies in the health care industry in general  and us in particular  have been and may continue to be subject to qui tam actions  we are unable to predict the future impact of such actions on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
anti kickback and self referral regulations medicare and medicaid anti kickback and anti fraud and abuse amendments codified under section b b of the social security act the anti kickback statute prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of health care services payable under the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid for by such programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal and civil penalties  as well as fines and possible exclusion from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
many states have statutes similar to the federal anti kickback statute  except that the state statutes usually apply to referrals for services reimbursed by all third party payers  not just federal programs 
in addition  it is a violation of the federal civil monetary penalties law to offer or transfer anything of value to medicare or medicaid beneficiaries that is likely to influence their decision to obtain covered goods or services from one provider or service over another 
the federal government has also issued regulations that describe some of the conduct and business relationships that are permissible under the anti kickback statute 
these regulations are often referred to as the safe harbor regulations 
the fact that certain conduct or a given business arrangement does not meet a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute 
rather  such conduct and business arrangements may be subject to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and should be reviewed on a case by case basis 
in addition to addressing other matters  as discussed below  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa also amended title xi usc section et seq 
to broaden the scope of fraud and abuse laws to include all health plans  whether or not payments under such health plans are made pursuant to a federal program 
section of the social security act commonly referred to as the stark law generally restricts referrals by physicians of medicare or medicaid patients to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship  unless one of several exceptions applies 
the referral prohibition applies to a number of statutorily defined designated health services  such as clinical laboratory  physical therapy  radiology  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
the exceptions to the referral prohibition cover a broad range of common financial relationships 
these statutory  and the subsequent regulatory  exceptions are available to protect certain permitted employment relationships  leases  group practice arrangements  medical directorships  and other common relationships between physicians and providers of designated health services  such as hospitals 
a violation of the stark law may result in a denial of payment  required refunds to patients and the medicare program  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each violation  civil monetary penalties of up to  for sham arrangements  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each day that an entity fails to report required information  and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other federal programs 
many states have adopted or are considering similar self referral statutes  some of which extend beyond the related state medicaid program to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
our participation in and development of joint ventures and other financial relationships with physicians could be adversely affected by these amendments and similar state enactments 

table of contents in accordance with our compliance program and our corporate integrity agreement with the federal government  which are described in detail under compliance program below  we have policies and procedures in place concerning compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  among others 
in addition  our compliance  law and audit services departments systematically review a substantial number of our arrangements with referral sources to determine the extent to which they comply with our policies and procedures and with the anti kickback statute  the stark law and similar state statutes 
health insurance portability and accountability act title ii  subtitle f of the health insurance portability and accountability act mandates the adoption of specific standards for electronic transactions and code sets that are used to transmit certain types of health information 
hipaa s objective is to encourage efficiency and reduce the cost of operations within the health care industry 
to protect the information transmitted using the mandated standards and the patient information used in the daily operations of a covered entity  hipaa also sets forth federal rules protecting the privacy and security of protected health information 
the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the rights of patients to understand and control how their information is used and disclosed 
the law provides both criminal and civil fines and penalties for covered entities that fail to comply with hipaa 
to receive reimbursement from cms for electronic claims  health care providers must use hipaa s electronic data transmission transaction and code set standards when transmitting certain health care information electronically 
our electronic data transmissions are compliant with current standards 
all covered entities  including those we operate  are also required to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa 
we are in material compliance with the privacy and security regulations  and we will continue to update training and procedures to address any compliance issues that develop 
further  all covered entities  including those we operate  have been assigned unique digit numeric identifiers and otherwise currently comply with the national provider identifier requirements of hipaa 
we have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with hipaa  and similar state privacy laws  under the guidance of our compliance department 
hospital compliance officers and information security officers are responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with our hipaa privacy and security policies and procedures at our hospitals 
we have also created an internal web based hipaa training program  which is mandatory for all employees 
based on existing and currently proposed regulations  as well as our experience with hipaa to this point  we continue to believe that the ongoing costs of complying with hipaa will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
health care facility licensing requirements in order to maintain their operating licenses  health care facilities must comply with strict governmental standards concerning medical care  equipment and cleanliness 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
our health care facilities hold all required governmental approvals  licenses and permits material to the operation of their business 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance in addition to certain statutory coverage limits and exclusions  federal laws and regulations  specifically the medicare conditions of participation  generally require health care providers  including hospitals that furnish or order health care services that may be paid for under the medicare program or state health care programs  to assure that claims for reimbursement are for services or items that are provided economically and only when  and to the extent  they are medically reasonable and necessary  of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care  and supported by appropriate evidence of medical necessity and quality 
the social security act established the utilization and quality control peer review organization program  now known as the quality improvement organization qio program  to promote the effectiveness  efficiency  economy and quality of services delivered to medicare beneficiaries and to ensure that those services are reasonable and necessary 
cms administers the qio program through a network of qios that work with consumers  physicians  hospitals and other caregivers to refine care delivery systems to assure patients receive the appropriate care at the appropriate time  particularly among underserved populations 
the qio program also safeguards the integrity of the medicare trust fund by reviewing medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges  and ensuring payment is made only for medically necessary services  and investigates beneficiary complaints about quality of care 
the qios have the authority to deny payment for services provided and recommend to hhs that a provider that is in substantial noncompliance with certain standards be excluded from participating in the medicare program 

table of contents medical and surgical services and practices are extensively supervised by committees of staff doctors at each of our health care facilities  are overseen by each facility s local governing board  the members of which primarily are community members and physicians  and are reviewed by our clinical quality personnel 
the local hospital governing board also helps maintain standards for quality care  develop short term and long range plans  and establish  review and enforce practices and procedures  as well as approves the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
certificate of need requirements some states require state approval for construction  expansion and closure of health care facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services 
certificates of need  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over health care facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and certain other matters 
as of december   we operated hospitals in eight states that require a form of state approval under certificate of need programs applicable to those hospitals 
we are unable to predict whether we will be required or able to obtain any additional certificates of need in any jurisdiction where they are required  or if any jurisdiction will eliminate or alter its certificate of need requirements in a manner that will increase competition and  thereby  affect our competitive position 
environmental matters our health care operations are subject to a number of federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations that govern  among other things  our disposal of solid waste  as well as our use  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous and toxic materials including radiological materials 
our operations also generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with laws and regulations that vary from state to state 
in addition  although we are not engaged in manufacturing or other activities that produce meaningful levels of greenhouse gas emissions  our operating expenses could be adversely affected if legal and regulatory developments related to climate change or other initiatives result in increased energy or other costs 
we could also be affected by climate change and other environmental issues to the extent such issues adversely affect the general economy or result in severe weather or climate change events affecting our facilities in coastal regions 
at this time  based on current climate conditions and our assessment of existing and pending environmental rules and regulations  as well as treaties and international accords relating to climate change  we do not believe that the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations  including regulations relating to climate change issues  will have a material adverse effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or cash flows 
consistent with our commitment to meet the highest standards of corporate responsibility  we have formed a corporate committee to regularly evaluate our environmental policies and to share best practices among our hospitals by identifying opportunities to reduce waste  use safer chemicals and consume less energy while at the same time managing costs prudently 
these efforts  among other things  have resulted in the substantial elimination of the use of mercury at our health care facilities and the adoption of corporate wide recycling and other programs 
we also seek to implement these objectives through our procurement practices by contracting with health care product suppliers and other organizations that endorse environmental and safety goals consistent with our corporate philosophy 
compliance program general 
we maintain a multi faceted corporate and hospital based compliance program that is designed to assist our corporate and hospital staff to meet or exceed applicable standards established by federal and state laws and regulations and industry practice 
we established an independent compliance department in to manage compliance related functions previously managed by our law department 
to ensure the independence of the compliance department  the following measures were implemented the compliance department has its own operating budget  the compliance department has the authority to hire outside counsel  access any tenet document and interview any of our personnel  and our chief compliance officer reports directly to the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 

table of contents in may  the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors approved an updated ethics and compliance program charter that furthers our goal of fostering and maintaining the highest ethical standards  and valuing our compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations as a foundation of our corporate philosophy 
the primary focus of the program is compliance with the requirements of the medicare and medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs 
pursuant to the terms of the charter  the compliance department is responsible for the following activities drafting company policies and procedures related to ethics and compliance issues  developing and providing compliance related education and training to all of our employees and  as appropriate  directors  contractors  agents and staff physicians  creating and disseminating our standards of conduct  monitoring  responding to and resolving all ethics and compliance related issues  ensuring that we take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action when noncompliant or improper conduct is identified  and measuring compliance with our policies and legal and regulatory requirements related to federal health care programs and our corporate integrity agreement described below 
each of our hospitals has a compliance officer on site 
these hospital based compliance officers report to regional compliance directors who report directly to our chief compliance officer 
corporate integrity agreement 
in june  we entered into a broad civil settlement agreement with the us department of justice doj and other federal agencies that concluded several previously disclosed governmental investigations  including inquiries into our receipt of certain medicare outlier payments before  physician financial arrangements and medicare coding issues 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia in september with the oig 
the cia establishes annual training requirements and compliance reviews by independent review organizations in specific areas 
in particular  the cia requires  among other things  that we maintain our existing company wide quality initiatives in the areas of evidence based medicine  standards of clinical excellence and quality measurements  maintain our existing company wide compliance program and code of conduct  formalize in writing our policies and procedures in the areas of billing and reimbursement  compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  and clinical quality  almost all of which were already in place when we entered into the cia and the remainder of which were put into place by january  provide a variety of general and specialized compliance training to our employees  contractors and physicians we employ or who serve as medical directors and or serve on our hospitals governing boards  and engage independent outside entities to provide reviews of compliance and effectiveness in five areas medicare outlier payments  diagnosis related group claims  unallowable costs  physician financial arrangements and clinical quality systems 
further  the cia requires us to maintain or establish performance standards and incentives that link compensation and incentive awards directly to clinical quality measures and compliance program effectiveness measures 
the cia also establishes a number of specific requirements for the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 
notably  the committee must retain an independent compliance expert  and assess our compliance program  including arranging for the performance of a review of the effectiveness of the program 
based on this work  the committee must then adopt a resolution for each reporting period of the cia regarding its conclusions as to whether we have implemented an effective compliance program 
the cia has the effect of increasing the amount of information we provide the federal government regarding our health care practices and our compliance with federal regulations 
the reports we provide could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities 
in addition  any determination that we have breached our cia or violated applicable health care laws or regulations could subject us to repayment obligations  civil and monetary penalties  exclusion from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and  for violations of certain laws and regulations  criminal penalties 
we have taken  and continue to take  all necessary steps to promote compliance with the terms of the cia 
ethics program we maintain a values based ethics program that is designed to monitor and raise awareness of ethical issues among employees and to stress the importance of understanding and complying with our standards of conduct 
all of our employees  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and principal accounting officer  are required to abide by our standards of conduct to ensure that our business is conducted in a legal and ethical manner 
the members of our board of directors and many of our contractors are also required to abide by our standards of conduct 
the standards reflect our basic values and form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with all corporate policies  procedures and practices 
our standards cover such areas as quality patient care  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  appropriate use of our assets  protection of patient information and avoidance of conflicts of interest 

table of contents as part of the program  we provide annual ethics and compliance training sessions to every employee  as well as our board of directors and certain physicians and contractors 
all employees are required to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of the standards of conduct  and are encouraged to contact our hour toll free ethics action line when they have questions about the standards or any ethics concerns 
incidents of alleged financial improprieties reported to the ethics action line or the compliance department are communicated to the audit committee of our board of directors 
all reports to the ethics action line are kept confidential to the extent allowed by law  and employees have the option to remain anonymous 
in cases reported to the ethics action line that involve a possible violation of the law or regulatory policies and procedures  the matter is referred to the compliance department for investigation 
retaliation against employees in connection with reporting ethical concerns is considered a serious violation of our standards of conduct  and  if it occurs  it will result in discipline  up to and including termination of employment 
the full text of our standards of conduct  and a number of our ethics and compliance policies and procedures  are published on our website  at www 
tenethealth

we have property  business interruption and related insurance coverage to mitigate the financial impact of catastrophic events or perils that is subject to deductible provisions based on the terms of the policies 
these policies are on an occurrence basis 
for the policy periods april  through march  and april  through march   we have coverage totaling million per occurrence  after deductibles and exclusions  with annual aggregate sub limits of million each for floods and earthquakes and a per occurrence sub limit of million for windstorms with no annual aggregate 
with respect to fires and other perils  excluding floods  earthquakes and windstorms  the total million limit of coverage per occurrence applies 
deductibles are of insured values up to a maximum of million for floods  california earthquakes and wind related claims  and of insured values for new madrid fault earthquakes  with a maximum per claim deductible of million 
other covered losses  including fires and other perils  have a minimum deductible of million 
professional and general liability insurance 
as is typical in the health care industry  we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
the health care industry has seen significant increases in the cost of professional liability insurance due to increased litigation 
in response  we formed and maintain captive insurance companies to self insure a substantial portion of our professional and general liability risk 
claims in excess of our self insurance retentions are insured with commercial insurance companies 
for the policy period june  through may   our hospitals generally have a self insurance retention of million per occurrence for all claims incurred 
our captive insurance company  the healthcare insurance corporation thinc  retains million per occurrence above our hospitals million self insurance retention level 
the next million of claims in excess of these aggregate self insurance retentions of million per occurrence are reinsured by thinc with independent reinsurance companies  with thinc retaining or a maximum of million 
claims in excess of million are covered by our excess professional and general liability insurance policies with major independent insurance companies  on a claims made basis  subject to an aggregate limit of million  with tenet retaining of the initial million layer in excess of million per claim or a maximum of million 
for the policy period june  through may   our hospitals generally have a self insurance retention of million per occurrence for all claims incurred 
thinc retains million per occurrence above our hospitals million self insurance retention level 
claims in excess of these aggregate self insurance retentions of million per occurrence are substantially reinsured up to million  with thinc retaining of the next million for each claim that exceeds million or a maximum of million 
claims in excess of million are covered by our excess professional and general liability insurance policies with major independent insurance companies  on a claims made basis  subject to an aggregate limit of million 
if the aggregate limit of any of our excess professional and general liability policies is exhausted  in whole or in part  it could deplete or reduce the excess limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period 
any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working capital 
in addition to the reserves recorded by our captive insurance subsidiaries  we maintain reserves  including reserves for incurred but not reported claims  for our self insured professional liability retentions and claims in excess of the policies aggregate limits  based on actuarial estimates of losses and related expenses 
also  we provide letters of credit to certain of our insurers  which can be drawn upon under certain circumstances  to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under a selected number of our professional and general liability insurance programs

table of contents if we are unable to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms  or if we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenues from our continuing general hospitals during the year ended december  was billion  which represented approximately of our total net patient revenues from continuing general hospitals 
in addition  approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
furthermore  in the year ended december   our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our continuing acute care hospitals was approximately higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers  including managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans 
at december   approximately of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
it would harm our business if we were unable to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms 
any material reductions in the payments that we receive for our services  coupled with any difficulties in collecting receivables from managed care payers  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in the medicare and medicaid programs or other government health care programs could have an adverse effect on our business 
for the year ended december   approximately of our same hospital net patient revenues were received from the medicare program  and approximately of our same hospital net patient revenues were received from various state medicaid programs  in each case excluding medicare and medicaid managed care programs 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements  funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements  among other things  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
most states began a new fiscal year on july  and although most addressed projected shortfalls in their final budgets  some states may face mid year budget gaps and many are already projecting shortfalls for state fiscal year  which could result in additional reductions to medicaid payments  coverage and eligibility or additional taxes on hospitals 
in general  we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited or if we  or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals  are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business continues to be adversely affected by a high volume of uninsured and underinsured patients  as well as declines in commercial managed care patients 
like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans 
as a result  we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts  and  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue or increase 
at the same time  we continue to experience declines in our commercial managed care volumes  which in the aggregate generate substantially higher yields than medicare and medicaid volumes 
in the year ended december   same hospital commercial managed care admissions declined and same hospital commercial managed care outpatient visits declined  in each case compared to the year ended december  the declines in our commercial managed care volumes are due  in part  to the related effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment 
going forward  our commercial managed care volumes may also be adversely impacted by the expiration of federal subsidies for those unemployed individuals and their family members who have been receiving subsidized continued health insurance coverage under their former employers health plans 
without these subsidies  health insurance coverage could become unaffordable for these people  which could result in lower commercial managed care volumes especially with respect to elective procedures at our hospitals 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive industry  and competition is one reason for declines we may experience in patient volumes 
a number of factors affect patient volumes and  thereby  our results of operations at our hospitals and related health care facilities  including the influence of local health care competitors 
generally  other hospitals in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals 
some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by government agencies or not for profit organizations 
these tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
we also face increasing competition from physician owned specialty hospitals and freestanding surgery  diagnostic and imaging centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
if competing health care providers are better able to attract more patients  recruit and retain physicians  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities  our patient volume levels may suffer 
our business and financial condition could be harmed if we are not able to attract and retain employees  physicians and other health care professionals  and our labor costs continue to be adversely affected by union activity and the shortage of experienced nurses 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of our employees and the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain skilled employees and an appropriate number of quality physicians and other health care professionals in all specialties on our medical staffs 
in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives  including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
in general  the loss of some or all of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified physicians and other health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on patient volumes and  thereby  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that adversely affect our labor costs include union activity  the nationwide shortage of experienced nurses and the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were represented by labor unions  and we and the hospital industry in general are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
we expect this trend to be even more pronounced in  as we renegotiate our existing labor contracts  all of which are scheduled to expire in the next months 
furthermore  like others in the health care industry  we continue to experience a shortage of experienced nurses in certain key specialties and geographic areas 
in addition  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future union activity or the future availability or cost of nursing personnel  but we expect to continue to experience salary  wage and benefit pressures 
our licensed hospital beds are heavily concentrated in certain market areas in florida  texas and california  which makes us sensitive to economic  regulatory  environmental and other developments in those areas 
as of december   the largest concentrations of licensed beds in our general hospitals were in florida  texas and california 
these concentrations increase the risk that  should any adverse economic  regulatory  environmental or other developments occur in these areas  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
specifically  a natural disaster or other catastrophic event could affect us more significantly than other companies with less geographic concentration 
in the recent past  hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in florida and texas  as well as in louisiana  and the patient populations in those states 
our california operations could be adversely affected by a major earthquake or wildfires in that state 
moreover  we currently expect to spend a total of approximately million unadjusted for inflation to comply with the requirements of california s seismic regulations for hospitals  of which approximately million was spent prior to january  
table of contents our business and financial results could be harmed by violations of existing regulations or compliance with new or changed regulations 
our business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to  among other things  licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  physician relationships  addition of facilities and services  and reimbursement rates for services 
the laws  rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex  and  in certain areas  the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance 
if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  we could be subject to penalties or liabilities or required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are also required to comply with various federal and state labor laws  rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues 
from time to time  we have been and expect to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation concerning our application of such laws  rules and regulations 
we cannot predict the effect that health care reform  if any  and other changes in government programs may have on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
national health care reform is a focus at the federal level  and congress is currently considering a number of proposals that may significantly impact the health care industry 
among other things  these proposals intend to decrease the number of uninsured legal us residents and reduce health care costs 
various mechanisms to fund health care reform legislation are being considered  including proposals that could reduce hospital reimbursement or otherwise adversely affect our revenues  and various mechanisms to control health care costs are being considered  including proposals that could impose new information technology requirements on our hospitals or otherwise increase our operating costs 
several states are also considering health care reform measures 
we cannot predict what form health care reform will take  or if significant health care reform in the near term will take place at all 
while federal or state health care reform could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  a decision by congress not to enact significant health care reform in the near term could also have a negative impact on investor sentiment about companies in the health care industry and  therefore  adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
the focus on health care reform may also increase the likelihood of material changes to existing government health care programs 
a significant portion of both our patient volumes and  as a result  our revenues is derived from government health care programs  principally medicare and medicaid 
in recent years  legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and  in some cases  reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under these government programs 
possible future changes in medicare  medicaid and other health care programs may reduce reimbursements to health care providers and insurers and may also increase our operating costs  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our operations have not been profitable for most of the last several years  and  if industry trends or general economic conditions worsen  our business operations and financial results may continue to be adversely affected 
we reported losses from continuing operations for the years ended december  through  a period during which we restructured our business to focus on a smaller group of general hospitals 
although our results of operations have recently improved  we continue to be impacted by a number of industry wide and company specific challenges  including declines in patient volumes over the last several years and high bad debt levels 
furthermore  we believe factors associated with the current economic downturn including higher levels of unemployment  reductions in commercial managed care enrollment  tightened credit markets  and instability in the banking and financial institution industries have had some impact on our volumes and have affected our ability to collect outstanding receivables 
if industry trends or general economic conditions worsen  we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability  and our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed 
trends affecting our actual or anticipated results may lead to charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of factors that have affected our industry generally and our business specifically  we have been required to record various charges in our results of operations 
our impairment tests presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results in our hospitals  which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospital s most recent projections 
if these projections are not met  or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we may incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our operating structure that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
any such charges could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide 
this shortage of liquidity and credit  combined with substantial losses in worldwide equity markets  could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession and result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access those markets  which could have a negative impact on our growth plans  our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions  and our ability to refinance existing debt 
the financial and credit crisis also could have an impact on the lenders under our credit facilities  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
our substantial leverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are a highly leveraged company 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total long term debt  as well as approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility  which is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals 
from time to time  we expect to engage in additional capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
our leverage and debt service obligations could have important consequences to an investor  including the following our credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain  and any future debt obligations may contain  covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and sell assets 
our credit agreement also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
the indentures governing our outstanding senior secured notes contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur liens  consummate asset sales  enter into sale and lease back transactions or consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our or their assets 
if we do not comply with these obligations  it may cause an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay the indebtedness immediately 
we may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business  in the health care industry  in the economy generally or if federal or state governments set further limitations on reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs 
we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at economically acceptable interest rates and other terms to meet our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  the payment of judgments or settlements  or general corporate purposes 
we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  which could reduce the amount of funds available for our operations or capital expenditures 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties note the disclosure required under this item is included in item 
table of contents item legal proceedings because we provide health care services in a highly regulated industry  we have been and expect to continue to be subject to various lawsuits  claims and regulatory proceedings from time to time 
the ultimate resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  whether as a result of litigation or settlement  could have a material adverse effect on our business both in the near and long term  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are currently a party to a number of legal and regulatory proceedings  including those described below 
governmental reviews pursuant to the five year corporate integrity agreement we entered into with the office of inspector general in september  we notified the oig in october that we had completed a preliminary review of admissions to our inpatient rehabilitation unit at south fulton medical center in east point  georgia that suggested further review was necessary to determine whether south fulton had received medicare overpayments reportable under our cia 
in january  we submitted this matter into the oig s voluntary self disclosure protocol 
the oig subsequently accepted our submission 
in february  we received a letter from the department of justice  which is participating in this matter with the oig  requesting additional information regarding the basis for our self disclosure  as well as information related to admissions at our other active and divested inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and units for the period to the date of the letter 
the government has since limited the scope of its review to the period may through december  in addition  the government asked to examine a limited sample of patient files at two inpatient rehabilitation facilities besides south fulton medical center before it determines if its review should extend to our other inpatient rehabilitation units 
that examination has been completed  and we are continuing to work with the doj and the oig regarding their review 
we are unable to predict the timing and outcome of this matter at this time 
separately  in  the doj  through the us attorney s office in the western district of new york  and the oig contacted a number of hospitals  including one tenet hospital  requesting information regarding their billing practices for kyphoplasty procedures 
kyphoplasty is a surgical procedure used to treat pain and related conditions associated with certain vertebrae injuries 
the doj and the oig requested the information in connection with their review of the appropriateness of medicare patients receiving kyphoplasty procedures on an inpatient basis as opposed to an outpatient basis 
to date  the request has been limited to only one of our hospitals 
we are fully cooperating with the doj and the oig  and have provided the requested information on a voluntary basis 
we are unable to predict the timing and outcome of the investigation  which is still in its preliminary stages at this time 
however  based on the total number of inpatient kyphoplasty procedures conducted during the review period at the hospital subject to the information request  we do not believe the outcome of this review will have a material adverse impact on us 
in addition  in february  the fiscal intermediary for our florida medical center began a probe review of the group billing practices of that facility s partial hospitalization program  a psychiatric treatment program that had the capacity to treat patients on an outpatient basis 
we also examined the records reviewed by the fiscal intermediary and independently determined that patients had multiple outpatient admissions with lengths of stay longer than expected for this program 
as a result of our review of this matter  we closed the program and  pursuant to our cia  notified the oig about our findings 
we have since engaged an external physician expert to assess the medical necessity and length of stay of the admissions in question 
we are working to complete our assessment  but are unable to predict the timing and outcome of this matter at this time 
wage and hour actions in september  the court granted our petition to coordinate two pending proposed class action lawsuits  mcdonough  et al 
v 
tenet healthcare corporation and tien  et al 
v 
tenet healthcare corporation  in los angeles superior court 
the mcdonough case was originally filed in june in san diego superior court  and the tien case was originally filed in may in los angeles superior court 
plaintiffs in both cases allege that our hospitals violated certain provisions of the california labor code and applicable california industrial welfare commission wage orders with respect to meal breaks  rest periods and the payment of one hour s compensation for meal breaks or rest periods not taken 
the complaint in the tien case also alleges that we have improperly rounded off time entries on timekeeping records and that our pay stubs do not include all information required by california law 
plaintiffs in both cases are seeking back pay  statutory penalties  interest and attorneys fees 
the plaintiffs in the mcdonough and tien cases filed motions  which we opposed  to certify these actions on behalf of virtually all nonexempt employees of our california subsidiaries  as separated into four classes and one subclass based on the specific claims at issue 
the court issued an initial ruling on the plaintiffs motions in june in that ruling  the court denied the plaintiffs request for class certification on the claim that employees missed rest periods 
however  the court granted the plaintiffs request for class certification on the claims that employees pay stubs did not contain all information required by california law and hourly employees did not receive appropriate wages due at the time of their termination 
the court also certified a subclass of hour shift employees who received missed meal penalties at a reduced rate  but stated that this subclass should be handled in connection with the pagaduan v 
fountain valley regional medical center action that was pending in the same court  which case we subsequently settled 
table of contents in may lastly  the court conditionally certified a class of all current or former hourly employees who were allegedly not provided meal periods  for the purpose of determining certain limited preliminary factual issues 
we filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s class certification ruling and  in november  the court issued a reconsidered ruling denying class certification with respect to all of the plaintiffs claims  except the subclass involving hour shift employees 
in december  the plaintiffs dismissed the claims of that subclass  which left only the claims of the individual plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision in february we continue to believe the court s november ruling was correct and are defending that ruling on appeal 
class action lawsuits resulting from hurricane katrina when hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast region in august  we owned five hospitals and a number of imaging centers in the new orleans area 
as previously reported  three lawsuits were filed as purported class actions in late by and on behalf of patients  their family members and others who were present and allegedly injured at two of those hospitals memorial medical center and lindy boggs medical center each of which we have since divested during the storm and its aftermath 
the plaintiffs allege that the hospitals were negligent in failing to properly prepare for the storm  failing to evacuate patients ahead of the storm  and failing to have a properly configured emergency generator system  among other allegations of general negligence 
the plaintiffs are seeking damages in various and unspecified amounts for the alleged wrongful death of some patients  aggravation of pre existing illnesses or injuries to patients who survived and were successfully evacuated  and the inability of patients and others to evacuate the hospitals for several days under conditions of extreme heat 
in september  class certification was granted in two of the suits preston  et al 
v 
tenet healthsystem memorial medical center  inc  et al 
and husband et al 
v 
tenet healthsystem memorial medical center  inc  et al 
in her order  the judge certified a class of all persons at memorial between august and september   excluding employees  who sustained injuries or died  as well as family members who themselves sustained injury as a result of such injuries or deaths to any person at memorial  excluding employees  during that time 
our appeals of the class certification ruling were exhausted in december when the supreme court of louisiana denied our writ of certiorari 
the civil district court for the parish of orleans will administer the class proceedings 
the class certification hearing in the remaining case dunn  et al

table of contents national agreement with aetna in march  we announced that tenet physicians inc  one of our subsidiaries  had entered into a national agreement with aetna that covers employed physicians and facilitates the participation of those physicians in aetna s provider networks 
the agreement also includes provisions promoting a joint  collaborative effort to enhance the credentialing process for the employed physicians 
significant challenges as stated above  there are a number of significant industry wide and company specific challenges that have been impacting our operating performance  including those summarized below 
volumes although we have seen some improvements in recent quarters  we have experienced declines in patient volumes over the last several years 
we believe the reasons for these declines include  but are not limited to  factors that have affected many hospital companies  including decreases in the demand for invasive cardiac procedures  increased competition and utilization pressure by managed care organizations 
given our geographic concentration  we are also affected by population trends  which have been a particular concern in florida 
in addition  we believe the industry wide challenges associated with physician recruitment  retention and attrition have also been significant contributors to our past volume declines 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians in all specialties on our medical staffs 
although we had a net overall gain in physicians added to our medical staffs in each of the last three years  in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives  including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
we continue to take steps to increase patient volumes  however  due to the concentration of our hospitals in california  florida and texas  we may not be able to mitigate some factors that contribute to volume declines 
one of our initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
we have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals  which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes 
we have also sought to include all of our hospitals and an increased number of our affiliated physicians in the affected geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts  which should result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks 
in addition  we have completed clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve our operating results 
this targeted growth initiative has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations  which have had a slightly negative impact on our volumes 
however  the elimination of these unprofitable service lines will allow us to focus more resources on services that are in higher demand and are more profitable 
our commitment to quality initiative is further helping position us to competitively meet the volume challenge 
we continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care 
as a result of these efforts  our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
in our continuing efforts to improve our clinical outcomes and drive down our costs of care  we launched our medicare performance initiative in this initiative is focused on the identification and reduction of costs associated with variations in physician and hospital practices 
the project includes the dissemination of best practices based on evidence based medicine  which we expect will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay  as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients 
we believe that quality of care improvements will continue to have the effect of increasing physician and patient satisfaction  potentially improving our volumes 
bad debt like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans 
the discounting components of our compact with uninsured patients compact have reduced our provision for doubtful accounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  but they do not mitigate the net economic effects of treating uninsured or underinsured patients 
we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts  and we continue to focus  where applicable  on placement of patients in various government programs  such as medicaid 
however  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue or increase 

table of contents cost pressures labor and supply expenses remain significant cost pressures for us as well as the industry in general 
controlling labor costs in an environment of fluctuating patient volumes and increased labor union activity will continue to be a challenge 
also  inflation and technology improvements are driving supply costs higher  and our efforts to control supply costs through product standardization  bulk purchases and improved utilization are constantly challenged 
general economic conditions we believe the current economic downturn  tight credit markets  and instability in the banking and financial institution industries has had some impact on our volumes and has affected our ability to collect outstanding receivables 
a significant amount of our admissions comes through our emergency rooms and  therefore  is not usually materially impacted by broad economic factors 
however  our levels of elective procedures and our ability to collect accounts receivable  due to the related effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment  may be materially impacted if the current economic environment continues 
we could also be negatively affected if california  florida or other states reduce funding of medicaid and other state health care programs 
results of operations overview our results of operations have been and continue to be influenced by industry wide and company specific challenges  including fluctuating volumes  decreased demand for inpatient cardiac procedures and high levels of bad debt  that have negatively affected our revenue growth and operating expenses 
we believe our future profitability will be achieved through volume growth  appropriate reimbursement levels and cost control across our portfolio of hospitals 
we also believe our results of operations for our most recent fiscal quarter best reflect recent trends we are experiencing with respect to volumes  revenues and expenses  therefore  we have provided below detailed information about these metrics for the three months ended december  and in order to disclose trends using data comparable to the prior year period  operating statistics in this section and throughout management s discussion and analysis are presented on a same hospital basis  where noted  and exclude the results of our sierra providence east medical center  which opened in may  and northshore regional medical center  which was reclassified to discontinued operations in the three months ended june  same hospital continuing operations three months ended december  admissions  patient days and surgeries increase decrease commercial managed care admissions governmental managed care admissions medicare admissions medicaid admissions uninsured admissions charity care admissions other admissions total admissions paying admissions excludes charity and uninsured total government program admissions charity admissions and uninsured admissions admissions through emergency department commercial managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions charity admissions as a percentage of total admissions surgeries inpatient surgeries outpatient total surgeries patient days total adjusted patient days patient days commercial managed care average length of stay days adjusted patient admissions the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  adjusted patient days admissions represents actual patient days admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues

unit revenue improvement was evident across all key metrics  primarily reflecting the improved terms of our commercial managed care contracts 
the growth in net inpatient revenue per admission of was adversely impacted by a shift in payer mix  including a decline in commercial managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions to in the three months ended december  as compared to in the three months ended december  the outpatient revenue per visit increase of was also constrained by an adverse mix shift  including a decline in commercial managed care outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits to in the three months ended december  as compared to in the three months ended december

salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased by approximately in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees  increased accruals for annual incentive compensation and our million discretionary contribution to the k plan accounts of employees who are not eligible for incentive compensation awards  partially offset by reduced contract labor expense and a decline in full time employee headcount 
excluding the discretionary contribution expense for our k plan  the percentage increase is supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  the increase in supplies expense is primarily due to increased utilization of high cost pharmaceuticals and biologics  as well as implantable devices 
other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to higher state provider taxes  increases in costs of contracted services  and a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations 
the increase was offset by a million  or  decline in total hospital malpractice expense to million in the three months ended december  compared to million in the three months ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to improved claims experience

provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase in provision for doubtful accounts was related to higher pricing and the basis point decline in our collection rate on self pay accounts

table of contents government programs the medicare program  the nation s largest health insurance program  is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of the us department of health and human services hhs 
medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals years of age and older  certain younger people with disabilities  and people with end stage renal disease  and is provided without regard to income or assets 
medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources  and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments 
medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nation s poor and most vulnerable individuals 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited  or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
medicare medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits 
one option  the original medicare plan  is a fee for service payment system 
the other option  called medicare advantage  includes health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations  private fee for service medicare special needs plans and medicare medical savings account plans

a general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan is provided below 
recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their estimated effect on our revenues can be found under regulatory and legislative changes 
acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group payments sections d and g of the social security act the act set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system pps 
under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps  medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge 
discharges are classified according to a system of medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups ms drgs  which categorize patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources 
cms assigns to each ms drg a relative weight that represents the average resources required to treat cases in that particular ms drg  relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all ms drgs 

table of contents the base payment amount for the operating component of the ms drg payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share 
both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted for geographic variations in labor and capital costs  respectively 
using diagnosis and procedure information submitted by the hospital  cms assigns each discharge to a ms drg  and the base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the ms drg assigned 
the ms drg operating and capital base rates  relative weights and geographic adjustment factors are updated annually  with consideration given to the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals  the relative costs associated with each ms drg  and changes in labor data by geographic area 
although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials  the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospital s operating and capital costs 
outlier payments outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals on individual claims for treating medicare patients whose medical conditions are costlier to treat than those of the average patient in the same ms drg 
to qualify for a cost outlier payment  a hospital s billed charges  adjusted to cost  must exceed the payment rate for the ms drg by a fixed threshold established annually by cms 
a medicare administrative contractor mac formerly known as a medicare fiscal intermediary calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospital s most recently filed cost report 
generally  if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the ms drg payment plus the fixed threshold  the hospital receives of the difference as an outlier payment 
under the act  cms must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all prospective payment system pps hospitals to be not less than nor more than of total ms drg payments outlier percentage 
the outlier percentage is determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of ms drg and outlier payments 
cms annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit 
a change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments  and the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify for outlier payments 
disproportionate share hospital payments in addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries  medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low income patients 
disproportionate share hospital dsh payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by cms and are calculated as a percentage add on to the ms drg payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for dsh payments 
the primary method for a hospital to qualify for dsh payments is based on a complex statutory formula that results in a dsh percentage that is applied to payments based on ms drgs 
the hospital specific dsh percentage is equal to the sum of the percentage of medicare inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for both the traditional medicare plan part a and supplemental security income ssi percentage  and the percentage of total inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for medicaid but not medicare part a 
hospitals receive interim dsh payments that are reconciled in the annual cost report 
cms develops and distributes the hospital specific ssi percentages  typically one year after the close of the federal fiscal year ffy  however  the release of the ssi percentages has been delayed in recent years as cms continues to examine and refine the data 
historically  the ssi percentage included only patient days paid under part a 
in june  cms released the ffy ssi percentages  which reflect a policy change to include the medicare advantage part c days in the ratio 
the ssi percentages will be used to settle our cost reports  and we estimate they will have an unfavorable impact on our medicare net revenue of approximately million 
cms has not released the and ssi percentages  however  using the ssi percentages to approximate the and ssi percentages  we estimate they will have an unfavorable impact on our medicare net revenue for our and cost reporting periods through june  of approximately million 
accordingly  we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of million million related to prior years and million related to the current year in the three months ended june  in  cms instructed hospitals to submit information related to part c for ffy and  according to the cms website  the ssi data is under review 
while we believe it is likely that cms will revise the ssi percentages in the future  we cannot predict what those changes will be or how they might impact our medicare net revenue 
during the three months ended september   we learned that cms had instructed the macs to suspend the settlement of all cost reports including ours in which the ssi percentages would be used 
however  the macs are authorized to use the ssi percentages for current dsh interim payments and tentative settlements for post cost reporting periods pending the release of the ssi percentages 
the cost report settlement suspension is still in effect  and we cannot predict when the suspension will be lifted 
the ssi percentage is subject to administrative and judicial review through the cost report appeal process  and we have filed a request for a hearing before the medicare provider reimbursement review board prrb on the inclusion of part c days in the ssi percentage  however  cost report appeals can take many years to resolve 
we cannot predict the outcome of our appeal before the prrb or any action cms might take with respect to the ssi percentages 
direct graduate and indirect medical education the medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions 
this additional reimbursement  which is subject to certain limits  including intern and resident full time equivalent fte limits established in  is made in the form of direct graduate medical education dgme and indirect medical education payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments 
medicare rules permit teaching hospitals to enter into medicare graduate medical education affiliation agreements for the purpose of applying the fte limits on an aggregate basis  and some of our teaching hospitals have entered into such agreements 

table of contents we were previously contacted by cms in connection with dgme fte limits and related reimbursement at doctors medical center in modesto  california as a result of our transaction with a county owned hospital in modesto and the ime and dgme residency program sponsored by the county 
we have annually collected approximately million of dgme reimbursement at the hospital 
we replied to cms that  based on our analysis of the transaction and the applicable cms rules  we believe that the dgme fte limits and related reimbursement reported on the hospital s cost reports were substantially correct 
in january  cms preliminarily advised us that they disagree with our analysis 
during the three months ended june   we submitted additional information to cms regarding the original transaction 
cms subsequently contacted us and stated that they continue to disagree with our analysis  and they instructed our mac to reopen settled cost reports to recover ime and dgme payments made to the hospital 
during the three months ended september   we submitted additional information for cms consideration 
also during the three months ended september   we received notices from our mac of its intent to reopen certain cost reports in connection with this matter 
we have since received settlement notices for the hospital s through cost reporting periods that reflect a disallowance of all of the hospital s ime and dgme payments  and the hospital s cost report was filed consistent with the mac s disallowance on the prior year cost reports 
additionally  the mac ceased making ime and dgme interim payments to the hospital for current and future services 
although we have taken steps necessary to protect our rights to formally challenge cms decision to disallow the ime and dgme funding for prior periods  it could take several years to resolve this issue and the outcome is uncertain at this time 
as a result  in the three months ended june   we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of million million related to and prior years and million related to the year ended december   and we have not subsequently recorded any ime or dgme revenue for this hospital 
during the three months ended december   stanislaus county confirmed its obligation with respect to a residency program funding grant agreement between doctors medical center and the county  as a result  we recorded an million receivable for that additional grant funding  which we received during cms recently revised certain of its policies regarding the eligibility of teaching programs for medicare ime and dgme reimbursement 
in january  the program sponsored by the county  doctors medical center and other hospitals obtained accreditation and other approvals effective for the academic year beginning july  for a residency program that we believe will satisfy cms requirements for reimbursement 
however  the aforementioned cms policy changes are not retroactive 
hospital outpatient prospective payment system under the outpatient prospective payment system  hospital outpatient services  except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule  are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications apcs 
services in each apc are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require  and a payment rate is established for each apc 
depending on the services provided  hospitals may be paid for more than one apc for an encounter 
cms periodically updates the apcs and annually adjusts the rates paid for each apc 
inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system ipf pps applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system 
the ipf pps is based on prospectively determined per diem rates and includes an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases 
inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment system rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by cms are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf under the irf prospective payment system irf pps 
payments under the irf pps are made on a per discharge basis 
a patient classification system is used to assign patients in irfs into case mix groups 
the irf pps uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups 
to be paid under the irf pps  each hospital or unit must demonstrate on an annual basis that at least of its total population had either a principal or secondary diagnosis that fell within one or more of the qualifying conditions designated in the medicare regulations governing irfs 
as of december   all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required threshold 

table of contents cost reports the final determination of certain medicare payments to our hospitals  such as dsh  dgme  ime and bad debt expense  are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports 
the final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal  and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
for filed cost reports  we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
medicaid medicaid programs and the corresponding reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year 
estimated payments under various state medicaid programs  excluding state funded managed care medicaid programs  constituted approximately  and of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also receive dsh payments under various state medicaid programs 
for the years ended december   and  our revenue attributable to dsh payments and other state funded subsidy payments was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
medicaid patient revenues of our continuing general hospitals by state for the years ended december  and are set forth in the table below years ended december  florida california missouri georgia texas pennsylvania south carolina north carolina nebraska alabama tennessee several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
most states began a new fiscal year on july  and although most addressed projected shortfalls in their final budgets  some states may face mid year budget gaps and many are already projecting shortfalls for state fiscal year  which could result in additional reductions to medicaid payments  coverage and eligibility or additional taxes on hospitals 
other states have proposed or enacted measures that are designed to preserve or restore medicaid funding 
provided below is information regarding recent significant state proposals and actions that are likely to affect our hospitals 
california the state of california has taken numerous actions over the past year to address severe budget shortfalls  including actions that affect revenues for our hospitals in the state 
on february   a new budget plan for california was released to address budget deficits in the state fiscal year  as well as the new state fiscal year beginning july  the new plan included eliminating some benefits and further reductions in coverage 
legal challenges to these reductions have been filed  and temporary injunctive relief on certain elements of the reductions was granted in march we cannot predict the final outcome of the litigation or the impact it might have on our results of operations  net revenues or cash flows 
additional cuts to the february budget  including approximately billion in cuts to health programs allocated between disproportionate share hospitals  the distressed hospital fund  hospital based skilled nursing facilities and other areas  were approved july  the budget agreement approved in july also included substantial cuts to funding for prison health care  which would have an estimated annual impact on revenues of certain of our california hospitals of approximately million 

table of contents according to recent state estimates  california faces a combined fiscal year and fiscal year deficit of approximately billion 
to address this shortfall  in january  the governor of california proposed nearly billion in cuts to health and human services programs  including a plan to reduce medi cal spending by limiting services  implementing an additional delay of payments to providers  eliminating medi cal coverage for certain immigrants and cutting other areas of the program 
further savings are proposed that could result in a million reduction in the healthy families program and an million reduction in funding for prison health care 
the proposed cuts require legislative action and some may require approval by cms 
we cannot predict the final outcome of the proposed reductions or the impact it might have on our results of operations  net revenues or cash flows 
separately  in october  the governor of california signed legislation supported by the hospital industry to impose an annual provider fee on general acute care hospitals that  combined with federal matching funds  will be used to provide supplemental medi cal payments to hospitals  as well as provide the state with million annually for children s health care coverage 
the provider supplemental payment plan created by this legislation proposes to provide these payments for up to months retroactive to april and expiring on december  the state has submitted the plan to cms for a required review and approval process and is awaiting a final determination 
based on modeling prepared as part of the legislative process  we estimate that  if the legislation is implemented as approved by the state  revenues  net of provider taxes  for our california hospitals could increase by approximately million for the full month period of the plan 
legislation to extend the supplemental payment plan has been introduced and  if approved  would allow the state to extend the provider fee for the length of any federal medicaid assistance percentage fmap extension passed by congress 
we are unable to predict what action the state of california or cms might take with respect to the provider fees and  because of the uncertainty regarding the final implementation and administration of the legislation  we cannot provide any assurances regarding the estimated impact 
florida florida s legislature held a special session in january to address that state s mid year budget deficit and proposed several changes for consideration in the full legislative session that commenced february  the changes passed in the special session resulted in a across the board reduction in medicaid rates effective march  the impact of these changes on our florida hospitals revenues was a reduction of approximately million in the fiscal year budget adopted in may did not include additional reductions to medicaid hospital payments 
recently  the governor of florida issued a proposed budget for the state fiscal year that includes a request for an additional billion in medicaid funding to cover costs associated with increased enrollment and utilization of medicaid health care services 
we cannot predict what action the legislature will take with regard to medicaid funding in its final budget 
in january  cms approved an amendment to an existing state medicaid waiver that preserves million in federal funding tied to the low income pool program 
we estimate that  without approval of this amendment  low income pool payments to our hospitals would have been reduced by as much as million in georgia the indigent care trust fund ictf  or dsh program  for private hospitals is funded with state funds that are subject to an annual legislative appropriation 
in  we received approximately million in ictf funds 
the availability and amount of future ictf funds for our hospitals is not guaranteed 
as in past years  the fiscal year budget submitted by the georgia department of community health provided funding for private hospitals  for which some  but not all  of our georgia hospitals would be eligible 
also  as in past years  the state legislature is considering extending eligibility for ictf funds to additional private hospitals 
we cannot predict what action the georgia legislature might take with regard to this legislation 
the governor s recent fiscal year budget request includes a proposed provider tax on hospitals of of net patient revenues and a managed care provider fee of of premium revenues to balance the state s medicaid budget 
in the absence of these fees  the department of community health estimates it will need to reduce medicaid provider payments by 
we cannot predict what action the governor or the legislature might take with regard to the implementation of a provider tax or cuts to medicaid provider payments 
missouri the governor of missouri is proposing million in general revenue reductions for the state fiscal year  including million to be cut from the state s medicaid program 
proposed reductions include cuts to the outpatient reimbursement methodology  placing a ceiling on inpatient unit costs for hospitals contracting with managed care plans  and re pricing of services for dual eligible individuals 
additionally  pending legislation would trade the state s current income tax for a tax on goods and services including health care of approximately 
if passed by the general assembly and signed by the governor  this proposal would also require approval by voters in november we cannot predict what action the governor or the legislature might take with regard to the implementation of tax changes or cuts to medicaid provider payments in missouri 

table of contents pennsylvania in october  the pennsylvania legislature passed and the governor approved a commonwealth fiscal year budget that cut billion in spending compared to the previous fiscal year 
hospital medicaid supplemental payments were cut an aggregate 
we estimate that these cuts will reduce our payments from pennsylvania by approximately million in the commonwealth s fiscal year ending june  in january  the commonwealth announced that revenues for the fiscal year were running million below estimates  leading to a projected fiscal year budget gap of million to billion 
as a result  the governor has proposed additional cuts to inpatient and outpatient dsh payments  medical education and certain supplemental payments 
based on limited details available at this time  we are unable to estimate the impact of the proposed reductions on the revenues of our hospitals in pennsylvania 
in addition  the commonwealth has indicated its intention to delay certain payments to providers 
north carolina the north carolina legislature enacted a million medicaid reduction in provider rates effective october  this resulted in a reduction of inpatient medicaid rates to hospitals 
hospital outpatient rates were exempted from the cuts 
we estimate that the aforementioned reduction will reduce our annual medicaid net revenues in north carolina by approximately million 
tennessee it is anticipated that the reductions the tenncare bureau outlined over the past several months will be included in the governor s budget recommendations 
these cuts would reduce projected state payments to hospitals by million and would include an annual  cap on inpatient hospital reimbursement and a limit of eight non emergency hospital outpatient procedures per year for non pregnant adults  as well as a reimbursement ceiling for hospitals at of medicare rates 
these changes are in addition to the fiscal year cuts scheduled to take effect on july  that are projected to reduce state hospital payments by million and would reduce our annual medicaid net revenues in tennessee by approximately million 
approval by cms will be required for some of the cuts to be implemented 
recently  the member hospitals of the tennessee hospital association voted to support the creation of a provider tax as an alternative to the proposed cuts 
this proposal  which would require approval by cms  could mitigate most  if not all  of the proposed and scheduled reductions 
we cannot predict what action the state or cms might take with respect to the proposed reductions or provider tax 
texas to address a projected budget shortfall in texas of approximately billion  the governor and legislative leaders recently mandated that each agency submit plans for achieving a reduction in state spending 
in february  the texas health and human services commission presented options for achieving million in savings from state health programs  including a rate reduction for medicaid and children s health insurance program providers  a million reduction applied to provider rates under medicaid managed care plans  and a million reduction in emergency services and trauma funds allocated for hospitals to cover indigent care 
legislative approval is not required and some  if not all  of the recommendations could be implemented effective september  we cannot estimate at this time which proposals might be implemented or the impact on our results of operations  net revenues or cash flows 
pressures on state budgets are expected to continue in the future 
the increased fmap adopted by congress in the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra will expire at the end of december in addition  health care reform legislation  if enacted  will likely include an expansion of medicaid eligibility 
we cannot predict what action congress might take to extend the increased fmap or expand medicaid eligibility or the impact those actions might have on state budgets or medicaid payments to our hospitals 
moratorium on medicaid regulations in may  cms issued a final rule  medicaid program  cost limit for providers operated by units of government and provisions to ensure the integrity of the federal state financial partnership  that places limits and restrictions on medicaid reimbursement to safety net hospitals 
a one year moratorium on implementation of the final rule was included in the ffy supplemental appropriations act  which meant that the rule could not take effect before may  on may   cms announced that it was voluntarily extending the moratorium for an additional days  then in june the moratorium was extended through march  as part of the ffy supplemental appropriations act 

table of contents also in may  cms issued a proposed rule clarifying that the agency would no longer provide federal medicaid matching funds for graduate medical education purposes  however  the ffy supplemental appropriations act contained language that placed a one year moratorium on any such restriction 
the moratorium was scheduled to expire on may  on may   cms announced that it was voluntarily extending the moratorium for an additional days  then in june the moratorium was extended through march  as part of the ffy supplemental appropriations act 
annual medicaid graduate medical education payments to our hospitals are approximately million 
the arra did not extend the moratoria on these regulations  however  it did note that congress believes that the secretary of hhs should not promulgate the proposed regulations relating to cost limits on public providers and medicaid graduate medical education payments as final 
cms has not taken further action on these rules  and we cannot predict what further action  if any  congress or cms will take on these issues 
regulatory and legislative changes recent regulatory and legislative updates to the medicare and medicaid payment systems are provided below 
payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient prospective payment system under medicare law  cms is required annually to update certain rules governing the inpatient prospective payment system 
the updates generally become effective october  the beginning of the federal fiscal year 
on july   cms issued the changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems for acute care hospitals and fiscal year rates final rule 
the final rule includes the following payment and policy changes a market basket increase currently estimated at for ms drg operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data hospitals that do not report specified quality measure data would receive an increase of  an increase in the cost outlier threshold from  to  a reduction of for projected outlier payments and the expiration of section hospital wage area reclassifications  a increase in the capital federal ms drg rate  and restoration of of capital ime payments for teaching hospitals 
the transitional medical assistance  abstinence education  and qualifying individuals programs extension act of tma act specifies that  to the extent the documentation and coding adjustments applied in ffy and ffy result in overpayments relative to the actual amount of documentation and coding related increases in connection with the transition to the ms drg system from the prior classification system  cms shall correct the overpayments and underpayments in ffys in the proposed changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and ffy rates proposed rule issued on may   cms estimated the adjustments required to recover estimated coding and documentation overpayments made in ffys and and prevent future coding and documentation overpayments required under the tma act to be and  respectively 
also in the proposed rule  cms proposed to reduce ffy rates by  the adjustment required to remove the ffy estimated overpayment from the current rates in order to prevent future coding and documentation overpayments related to ffy rates 
in the final rule  cms confirmed its earlier estimates of the aforementioned adjustments required under the tma act  however  instead of imposing the reduction to ffy rates as proposed  in the final rule cms stated its intent not to impose any coding and documentation adjustments to the ffy ipps rates pending its complete review of the ffy and data 
also in the final rule  cms stated that it will defer the recovery of the ffy and estimated coding and documentation adjustments and consider phasing in future coding and documentation adjustments over an extended period beginning in ffy as permitted under the tma act 
refer to medpac recommendations below for additional information regarding the coding and documentation adjustments 
cms projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes included in the final rule will yield an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas populations over million 
using the impact percentages in the final rule as applied to our medicare ipps payments for the months ended september   the estimated annual impact for all changes in the final rule on our hospitals is an increase in our medicare inpatient revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty regarding other factors that may influence our future ipps payments by individual hospital  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 

table of contents payment changes to the medicare inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system on april   cms issued a notice of the medicare inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system update for the rate year beginning july  ipf pps notice 
the ipf pps notice includes the following payment changes an update to the ipf payment equal to the market basket of  and an increase in the fixed dollar loss threshold amount for outlier payments from  to  at december   of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient psychiatric units 
cms projects that the combined impact of the payment changes will yield an average increase in payments for all ipfs including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals  and an average increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas 
using the urban psychiatric unit impact percentage as applied to our medicare ipf payments for the months ended june   the annual impact of the payment changes included in the ipf pps notice on our psychiatric units may result in an estimated increase in our medicare revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future ipf payments  including future legislation  admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes 
payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system on july   cms issued the final rule for the medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system for ffy irf pps final rule 
the irf pps final rule includes the following payment and policy changes  which  except as noted  were effective for discharges on or after october  a market basket update to the irf pps payment rate equal to  an increase in the outlier threshold for high cost outlier cases from  to  an update to the case mix group relative weights and average length of stay values using ffy data  and a new regulatory framework that clarifies the coverage criteria including provisions regarding patient selection and care that became effective january  at december   of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient rehabilitation units 
cms projects that the payment and policy changes in the irf pps final rule will result in an estimated total increase in aggregate irf payments of million or of total irf pps payments 
this estimated increase includes an average increase for rehabilitation units in urban areas for ffy using the urban rehabilitation unit impact percentage as applied to our medicare irf payments for the months ended september   the annual impact of all payment and policy changes in the irf pps final rule on our rehabilitation units may result in an estimated increase in our medicare revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future irf payments  including legislative action  admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  and the impact of compliance with the irf admission criteria  we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes 
payment and policy changes to the medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system on october   cms issued the changes to the hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps and calendar year cy payment rates opps rule 
the opps rule includes the following payment and policy changes an update to opps payments equal to the estimated market basket of  hospitals that did not take part in the hospital outpatient quality data reporting program hop qdrp or that did not successfully report their quality measures will have their update reduced by two percentage points  the continuing requirement that hospitals taking part in the hop qdrp report seven existing chart abstracted emergency department and perioperative measures  along with four claims based imaging efficiency measures for payment determination for cy payments  and 
table of contents the implementation of provisions of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of that extend medicare coverage to important rehabilitative and educational services intended to improve the health of patients diagnosed with certain respiratory  cardiac and renal diseases 
beginning january   hospitals are able to bill medicare for new pulmonary and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services furnished in hospital outpatient departments to medicare beneficiaries 
cms projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the opps rule will yield an average increase in payments for all hospitals and an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas populations over million 
according to cms estimates  the projected annual impact of the payment and policy changes in the opps rule on our hospitals is million  an increase of approximately over projected cy opps payments 
because of the uncertainty regarding other factors that may influence our future opps payments  including volumes  case mix and additional costs associated with the physician supervision requirements described below  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
in the preamble to the medicare cy opps final rule  cms provided a restatement and clarification of its requirements originally set forth in the april opps final rule for physician supervision of therapeutic services provided to medicare patients in a hospital setting 
in the opps rule  cms made several important changes to its outpatient physician supervision policy including the following in cy  cms will allow certain nonphysician practitioners specifically physician assistants  nurse practitioners  clinical nurse specialists  certified nurse midwives and licensed clinical social workers to provide direct supervision for all hospital outpatient therapeutic services that they are authorized to personally perform according to their state scope of practice rules and hospital granted privileges 
under prior policy  generally only physicians could provide the direct supervision of these services 
for purposes of on campus hospital outpatient therapeutic services  cms is defining direct supervision to mean that the physician or nonphysician practitioner must be present anywhere on the hospital campus and immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure 
for services furnished in an off campus provider based department  direct supervision would continue to mean that the physician or nonphysician practitioner must be present in the off campus provider based department and immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure 
cms also will require that all hospital outpatient diagnostic services furnished directly or under arrangement  whether provided in the hospital  in a provider based department or at a non hospital location  follow the medicare physician fee schedule physician supervision requirements for individual tests 
we have completed our evaluation of our provider based on campus and off campus outpatient departments to address the physician supervision requirements set forth in the opps rule 
changes were made in a small number of off campus departments to meet the new requirements  including location changes and new contracts for required physician coverage 
these changes are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
in the opps rule  cms has indicated that in the case of outpatient therapeutic services furnished on a hospital s campus from through  cms will exercise its discretion and decline to enforce in situations involving claims where a hospital s noncompliance with cms direct physician supervision policy resulted from error or mistake 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the president signed the arra into law 
the arra includes billion in new spending on health information technology hit  most of which is for incentive medicare and medicaid payments to physicians and hospitals 
the legislation requires that hospitals and physicians become meaningful users of electronic health records ehr and submit quality data as a condition of receiving the incentive payments beginning in if we are able to achieve full compliance at all of our hospitals by  we could receive approximately million in total estimated combined medicare and medicaid hospital incentive payments 
however  based on the timeframe we anticipate it will take for us to achieve full compliance with the hit requirements  it is unlikely that we will be able to realize the maximum amount of incentive payments of million 
we will be required to make investments in hit through of approximately million million of which has already been incurred compared to approximately million of medicare and medicaid incentive payments that we will likely be able to begin recognizing no later than based on our anticipated hit implementation timeframe 
the medicare incentive payments to individual hospitals would be made over a four year  front weighted transition period 
the medicaid incentive payments  although federally funded  will be administered by the states and are subject to more flexible payment and compliance standards 
hospitals that achieve compliance between and will receive reduced incentive payments during the transition period 
we anticipate that  in addition to the expenditures we will incur to qualify for these incentive payments  our operating expenses will increase in the future as a result of these information system investments 
much or all of these expenditures may have been made by us as a part of our clinical systems enhancements  but would not have been incurred in the timeline to comply with the incentive payment requirements of the arra 
however  we anticipate there will be other operational benefits that we can realize as a result of these hit enhancements that are not included in the above amounts 
hospitals that fail to become meaningful users of ehr or fail to submit quality data by will be subject to penalties in the form of a reduction to medicare payments 
this reduction  which will be based on the market basket update  will be phased in over three years and will continue until a hospital achieves compliance 
using an estimated market basket of and our annual medicare inpatient net revenues for the year ended december   should all of our hospitals fail to become meaningful users of ehr and fail to submit quality data  the penalties would result in reductions to our annual medicare traditional inpatient net revenues of approximately million  million and million in   and and subsequent years  respectively 

table of contents on december   cms released a proposed rule defining the meaningful use of ehr and describing the provisions of the incentive programs that encourage the adoption and use of ehrs 
a related interim final rule also issued on december  by the office of the national coordinator for health it sets initial standards  implementation specifications  and certification criteria for ehr technology 
both rules are open to public comment for days from the date of issuance 
the interim final rule for ehr certification will take effect days after publication 
we are currently evaluating what changes will be required to our information systems  the cost of those changes  and the time and resources required in order for our hospitals to become meaningful users of hit 
the complexity of the changes required to our hospitals systems and the time required to complete the changes will likely result in some or all of our hospitals not being fully compliant in time to be eligible for the maximum hit funding permitted under the arra 
because of the uncertainties regarding the implementation of hit  including cms future implementation regulations  the ability of our hospitals to achieve compliance and the associated costs  we cannot provide any assurances regarding the aforementioned estimates 
medicare payments to physicians in the final rule updating the medicare physician fee schedule mpfs for cy  cms adopted an update of negative that was scheduled to take effect on january  mpfs rates are updated annually based on a formula that includes the sustainable growth rate sgr formula 
the sgr formula has resulted in negative updates since  however  cms has taken action or congress has enacted legislation each year to avoid the negative updates 
on december   the president signed the department of defense appropriations act  into law 
among other things  that act delays the scheduled medicare payment reduction for physician services until march  congress is now considering several proposals to delay the payment cut further  as well as proposals that would replace the sustainable growth rate formula with another methodology for setting medicare physician payment rates 
we cannot predict what actions  if any  congress or cms may take with respect to the mpfs update 
refer to medpac recommendations below for additional information regarding the mpfs update 
health care reform on november   the us house of representatives passed the affordable health care for america act and  on december   the us senate passed the patient protection and affordable care act  both of which would make significant changes to the us health care system by requiring most individuals to have health insurance coverage 
to fund the expansion of insurance coverage  both bills contain measures designed to promote quality and cost efficiency in health care delivery and to generate budgetary savings in the medicare program 
in addition to proposals relating to medicare advantage payments  bundling acute and post acute care  readmissions and value based purchasing  congress is considering negative adjustments to the annual market basket updates for medicare inpatient  outpatient  long term acute hospital and inpatient rehabilitation payment systems  reductions to medicare and medicaid dsh payments  and adjustments to address variations in medicare reimbursements among geographic regions and individual providers 
to reduce the number of uninsured americans  congress is also considering expanding medicaid eligibility to additional populations and creating a new insurance exchange 
on february   the president outlined a proposal to bridge the gap between the aforementioned house and senate bills 
the president s proposal includes the following provisions improving insurance protections for consumers and creating a new federal authority to provide assistance and oversight to the states in monitoring and potentially denying unreasonable rate increases and other unfair practices of insurance companies  requiring most americans to carry health insurance coverage  with federal subsidies to help many afford the premiums insurance companies would be barred from denying coverage to people with medical problems or charging them more  strengthening the provisions to fight fraud  waste and abuse in medicare and medicaid  increasing the threshold for the excise tax on the most expensive health plans from  for a family plan to  and starting the excise tax in for all plans  and eliminating the favorable nebraska fmap provision in the senate bill and providing additional funding to all states for the expansion of medicaid 
we are unable to predict what action congress or the president might take with respect to final legislation affecting health care or the impact such legislation might have on our revenues  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents ffy budget proposal on february   the president released a trillion ffy budget proposal 
the budget request assumes enactment of health care reform legislation  but does not propose additional cuts to medicare and medicaid hospital payments for ffy the key provisions of the budget proposal affecting hospitals include an extension of the fmap increase contained in the arra for an additional six months through june   an extension of the period during which an individual may qualify for consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act premium assistance provided in the arra through december   a proposal to allocate billion over years to eliminate the sustainable growth rate cut and freeze medicare physician payments  and a million increase in discretionary funding for federal health care fraud and abuse control activities 
legislation to approve these proposals must be enacted by congress for them to become effective 
we cannot predict what action congress or the president might take with respect to such legislation or the impact the legislation might have on our revenues  results of operations or cash flows 
the budget proposal also states that the president intends to create a bipartisan commission to make recommendations for balancing the federal budget and reducing the deficit starting in those recommendations could include cuts to medicare and medicaid spending 
we cannot predict at this time what recommendations might be made by such a commission or the potential impact of those recommendations on our revenues  results of operations or cash flows 
medicare recovery audit contractor rac initiative section of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of directed the secretary of hhs to demonstrate the use of racs under cms medicare integrity program in identifying underpayments and overpayments under the medicare program  and recouping those overpayments 
racs are third party organizations under contract with cms  and the law provides that compensation paid to each rac be based on a percentage of overpayment recoveries identified by the rac 
the rac demonstration was slated to end in march  however  section of the tax relief and health care act of trhca made the rac program permanent and instructed cms to use racs to identify medicare underpayments and overpayments by the trhca also included several provisions that give medicare providers certain protections and rights 
for example  overpayments identified by the racs are subject to reconsideration and appeal through several forums 
we intend to pursue the reversal of adverse determinations where appropriate  however  we cannot predict the outcome of any such appeals 
in addition to any overpayments identified by the racs that are not reversed  we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials 
we have established protocols to respond to rac requests and payment denials  if any 
several of our hospitals recently received rac requests and are in the process of responding to those requests 
we cannot predict the impact of the rac reviews on our results of operations or cash flows at this time 
medpac recommendations the medicare payment advisory commission medpac is an independent congressional agency established by the balanced budget act of to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program 
the medpac s statutory mandate is quite broad  in addition to advising congress on payments to private health plans participating in medicare advantage and providers in the original medicare plan  medpac is also tasked with analyzing access to care  quality of care and other issues affecting medicare 
on january   medpac voted on final recommendations for their march report to congress 
recommendations affecting medicare payments include the following congress should increase payment rates for the acute inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems in by the projected rate of increase in the hospital market basket index  concurrent with implementation of a quality incentive payment program 
to restore budget neutrality  congress should require the secretary of hhs to fully offset increases in inpatient payments due to hospitals documentation and coding improvements 
to accomplish this  hhs must reduce payment rates in the inpatient prospective payment system by the same percentage not to exceed each year in  and the lower rates would remain in place until overpayments are fully recovered 

table of contents the update to the payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation services should be eliminated for ffy congress should update payments for physician services in by 
private insurance managed care we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
hmos generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician  hospital  pharmacy and ancillary service providers that hmo members must access through an assigned primary care physician 
the member s care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the hmo s quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner 
hmos typically provide reduced benefits or reimbursement to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care or none at all 
ppos generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers 
ppo members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit  typically in the form of lower co payments  co insurance or deductibles 
as employers and employees have demanded more choice  managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both hmo and ppo plans 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the years ended december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
national payers generate approximately of our total net managed care revenues 
the remainder comes from regional or local payers 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans 
a increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowance would impact the estimated reserves by million 
some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include changes in reimbursement levels for procedures  supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered  changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached  changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing  final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels  secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments  and reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels 
contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms  as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
we expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term 
however  the managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans  which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend 
although we have had eighteen consecutive quarters of improved year over year managed care pricing  we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in the future 
in the year ended december   our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers  including managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans 

table of contents the us house of representatives and senate are currently considering legislation that would make significant changes to the us health care system  including changes designed to expand insurance coverage to many of the estimated million americans who are uninsured 
proposals include a mandate on individuals to purchase insurance  a mandate on businesses to provide insurance or pay into a government insurance fund  and income based subsidies for individuals and families to purchase private or public insurance coverage through a government run health insurance exchange 
the legislation as proposed would also establish new criteria for health insurance coverage in the individual and small group markets  including guaranteed issue and renewal requirements  restrictions on premium rating and rescissions  and limits on beneficiary cost sharing and annual and lifetime benefit caps 
as part of reform legislation  congress is also considering the president s proposal to cut as much as billion over ten years from payments to medicare advantage health plans  and the imposition of an excise tax on high cost insurance plans or insurance companies directly 
we are unable to predict what action congress or the president might take with respect to final legislation or the impact such legislation ultimately might have on our managed care business 
indemnity an indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient  subject to an increasing number of policy conditions and exclusions 
unlike an hmo member  a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers 
self pay patients self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments  such as medicare and medicaid  and who do not have some form of private insurance and  therefore  are responsible for their own medical bills 
a significant portion of our self pay patients is being admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment that is more costly to provide and  therefore  results in higher billings  which are the least collectible of all accounts 
we believe our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors  including increased unemployment rates  reductions in state medicaid budgets  increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance  and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers 
self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients 
further  a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients  as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance 
we have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts  as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance  that we deem highly collectible 
we are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
over the longer term  several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge 
for example  our compact is designed to offer managed care style discounts to most uninsured patients  which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges 
a significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts 
under the compact  the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance  which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded 
the uninsured patient accounts  net of contractual allowances recorded  are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process 
the estimated costs based on selected operating expenses  which include salaries  wages and benefits  supplies and other operating expenses of caring for our self pay patients for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive 
most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received  subject to a cap 
except for the per diem amounts  our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  therefore  we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts 
most states include an estimate of the cost of charity care in the determination of a hospital s eligibility for medicaid dsh payments 
the estimated costs based on the selected operating expenses described above of caring for charity care patients for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents the us house of representatives and senate are currently working on legislation that would make significant changes to the us health care system  including changes designed to expand insurance coverage to many of the estimated million americans who are uninsured 
a reduction in the number of self pay patients likely would favorably impact our revenues and provision for doubtful accounts  however  with final legislation still pending  we are unable to predict what impact such legislation ultimately might have on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following two tables summarize our net operating revenues  operating expenses and operating income from continuing operations  both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues  for the years ended december  and years ended december  increase decrease net operating revenues general hospitals other operations net operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts other operating expenses  net depreciation and amortization impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges litigation and investigation costs  net of insurance recoveries operating income years ended december  increase decrease net operating revenues general hospitals other operations net operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts other operating expenses  net depreciation and amortization impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges litigation and investigation costs  net of insurance recoveries operating income net operating revenues of our continuing general hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues  as well as nonpatient revenues primarily rental income  management fee revenue and income from services such as cafeterias  gift shops and parking and other miscellaneous revenue 
net operating revenues of other operations primarily consist of revenues from physician practices  a rehabilitation hospital  which we closed during the three months ended march   and a long term acute care hospital 
only one of our individual hospitals represented more than approximately of our net operating revenues for the year ended december   and one represented more than approximately of our total assets  excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables  at december  net operating revenues from our other operations were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

revenues during the year ended december   net operating revenues from continuing operations increased compared to the year ended december  our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended december  increased by compared to the year ended december  there were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues 
key positive factors include improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts  favorable adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   and dsh payments and other state funded subsidy payments of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  key negative factors include a decrease in same hospital commercial managed care admissions of

total same hospital outpatient visits and outpatient surgery visits for increased by and  respectively  compared to commercial managed care outpatient visits declined in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
table of contents salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  same hospital salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased by approximately in as compared to this increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees  an increase in the number of employed physicians and higher incentive compensation and health benefits costs  partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount  reduced contract labor expense  lower stock based compensation expense  and lower overtime costs 
contract labor expense  which is included in salaries  wages and benefits  was million in the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  as compared to the year ended december  at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were represented by labor unions 
labor relations at our facilities generally have been satisfactory 
we and the hospital industry in general  are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
we expect this trend to be even more pronounced in  as we renegotiate our existing labor contracts  all of which are scheduled to expire in the next months 
as union activity increases  our operating expenses may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues 
in addition  legislation has been introduced in congress that could significantly change both union organizing and bargaining over initial labor contracts in a way that is likely to increase union membership  at least in the short term 
we are unable to predict what action congress or the president might take with respect to this or any other labor related legislation or the impact such legislation might ultimately have on our relations with employees and unions 
we currently have labor contracts and collective bargaining agreements with the california nurses association cna  the service employees international union seiu  the united nurses associations of california unac and the american federation of state  county and municipal employees that cover registered nurses  service and maintenance workers  and other employees at of our general hospitals in california  three of our general hospitals in florida and one of our general hospitals in philadelphia 
all of these union agreements set stable and competitive wage increases within our budgeted expectations through various dates in and early in january  we commenced the process of renegotiating these contracts  beginning with our collective bargaining agreements with unac at two of our hospitals in california 
we also have separate peace accords with both the cna and the seiu that provide each union with limited access to attempt to organize certain of our employees and establish specific guidelines for the parties to follow with respect to organizing activities 
both peace accords expire in december the cna and the seiu have engaged in union organizing activities at several of our hospitals in houston  memphis and philadelphia pursuant to the terms of the peace accords 
registered nurses at two of these facilities have participated in elections concerning cna representation  but to date union organizing has been successful at only cypress fairbanks medical center cyfair 
after extended collective bargaining negotiations over an initial contract for cyfair  the cna triggered an agreed to interest arbitration process  which began in june  that provides for a neutral third party to mediate unresolved contract terms 
if the mediation is unsuccessful  those unresolved terms will be decided by binding arbitration 
we also are defending various allegations that we are in violation of federal labor laws or the terms of our collective bargaining agreements and peace accords  and we expect to continue to be subject to such claims from time to time in the normal course of business 
supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   supplies expense per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis increased by in compared to the increase in supplies expense is primarily due to the increase in the number of surgeries  which grew by  and increased utilization of high cost implants  high cost pharmaceuticals and increased orthopedic costs 
a portion of the increase in supplies expense was offset by revenue growth related to payments we receive from certain payers 
we strive to control supplies expense through product standardization  bulk purchases  contract compliance  improved utilization and operational improvements that should minimize waste 
the items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers  orthopedics and implants  and high cost pharmaceuticals 
we also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of broadlane  inc  a company that offers group purchasing procurement strategy  outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry 

table of contents as part of health care reform legislation  congress is considering imposing an annual tax on manufacturers of certain medical devices and pharmaceuticals  as well as other provisions that could affect hospital group purchasing organizations 
we are unable to predict what action congress or the president might take with respect to the legislation or the impact those provisions ultimately might have on our supplies expense  if enacted 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues on a same hospital basis was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts was related to decreased collection rates on self pay accounts  higher pricing and higher patient insurance deductibles  partially offset by the decline in uninsured revenues and improved managed care accounts receivable aging categories 
our self pay collection rate  which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable  declined to approximately in the year ended december  from in the prior year 
the table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at december  and december  december  december  accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net medicare medicaid net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances commercial managed care governmental managed care self pay uninsured self pay balance after insurance estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to collection agencies other payers total continuing operations total discontinued operations a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients  as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance 
collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus  particularly over the past several years  as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix 
at december   our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately  including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency 
during and  we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows at march   at june   at september   at december   at march   at june  and at september  these self pay collection rates include payments made by patients  including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance  prior to an account being classified and assigned to our in house self pay collection group 
based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at december   a hypothetical decline in our self pay collection rate  or approximately  would result in an unfavorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
we have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts we deem highly collectible 
we are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 

table of contents payment pressure from managed care payers also affects our provision for doubtful accounts 
we typically experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes  however  we continue to work with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services 
our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately at december  and at december   which includes collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency 
we continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow 
one specific initiative is our center for patient access services cpas  which was completed during at the hospitals scheduled to participate in the program 
cpas is a centralized  dedicated operation that performs financial clearance  including completing insurance eligibility checks  documenting verification of benefits  providing required notifications to managed care payers  obtaining pre authorizations when necessary and contacting the patient to offer pre service financial counseling 
although we continue to improve our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable 
we manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as total cash collections  point of service cash collections  accounts receivable days outstanding ar days  and accounts receivable by aging category 
the following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our net accounts receivable from continuing operations of billion and billion at december  and  respectively  excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total our ar days from continuing operations were days at december  and days at december  ar days at december  and were within our targets of less than and days  respectively 
ar days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our revenue from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter 
as of december   we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our in house collection agency 
these accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts  however  an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts at collection agencies is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable 
patient advocates from our medical eligibility program mep screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs 
they also expedite the process of applying for these government programs 
receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for medicaid are classified as medicaid pending  under our mep  with appropriate contractual allowances recorded 
based on recent trends  approximately of all accounts in our mep are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as medicaid 

table of contents the following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our mep still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at december  and by aging category december  days days days over days total includes accounts receivable of million at both december  and that are fully reserved 
other operating expenses  net other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased by in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  other operating expenses per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis decreased by approximately in as compared to contributing to this decrease was a million  or  decline in total hospital malpractice expense to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease in malpractice expense is principally due to a reduction in the number of expected claims  partially offset by a basis point decline in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future liabilities 
declines in consulting costs  utility costs  reimbursable business expenses  recruiting related costs and systems implementations costs also had a favorable impact on other operating expenses 
these declines were partially offset by increases in other items  including higher physician fees relating to increased emergency department on call payments and higher costs for contracted services  as well as a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million 
we recorded a million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings  equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of one hospital to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates 
material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital  consistent with our prior estimates during when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospital s long lived assets 
because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the hospital s long lived assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying values of the long lived assets  this hospital is at risk of future impairments  particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospital s fair value or if the fair value of the hospital s real estate continues to decline 
we also recorded a million net impairment charge for the write down of land and buildings at the current campus of one hospital that is scheduled to move to a new  replacement campus during our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from use of the current campus for several months during and from estimated disposition proceeds were less than the carrying values of the land and buildings at the current campus 
we compared the estimated fair values to the carrying values and  because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
the remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended december  include million of employee severance and other related costs  a million impairment charge for the write down of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals as a result of the buyer filing for bankruptcy  and a million impairment charge for the write down of other assets primarily related to an option to purchase certain real property near one of our hospitals that no longer has value due to the financial condition of the owner of the real property 
during the year ended december   net impairment and restructuring charges of million included an million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of two hospitals to their estimated fair values due to adverse current and anticipated future financial trends based on their most recent projections at that time 
we believe the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends include shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers and high levels of uninsured patients 
the remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended december  include million of employee severance and other related costs  million for the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and million in impairment charges for the write down of other assets primarily due to the write down of costs associated with an expansion project at one of our hospitals that we decided not to pursue based on unfavorable economics forecasted for the project  partially offset by a million reduction in reserves recorded in prior periods 

table of contents our impairment tests presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results of our hospitals  which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospital s most recent projections 
if these projections are not met  or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we may incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our regions that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
litigation and investigation costs  net of insurance recoveries litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the costs primarily relate to reserves established in connection with certain governmental reviews further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the costs also include amounts paid to indemnify a former officer of the company in a matter to which the company was not a party and costs to defend the company in various matters 
the costs primarily relate to changes in our estimated liability for now settled wage and hour actions further described in note to the consolidated financial statements

additional supplemental non gaap disclosures the financial information provided throughout this report  including in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  we use certain non gaap financial measures defined below in communications with investors  analysts  rating agencies  banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements  some of which are recurring or involve cash payments 
in addition  we from time to time use these measures to define certain performance targets under our compensation programs 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure that we use in our analysis of the performance of our business  which we define as net income attributable to our common shareholders before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle  net of tax  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  preferred stock dividends  income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  income tax expense benefit  net gain loss on sales of investments  investment earnings loss  gain loss from early extinguishment of debt  interest expense  litigation and investigation costs benefit  net of insurance recoveries  hurricane insurance recoveries  net of costs  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries  amortization  and depreciation 
as is the case with all non gaap measures  investors should consider the limitations associated with this metric  including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another  and should recognize that adjusted ebitda does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance because it excludes many items that are included in our financial statements 
accordingly  investors are encouraged to use gaap measures when evaluating our financial performance

adjusted free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that we use in our business as an alternative to net cash provided by used in operating activities 
we provide this financial measure as a supplement to gaap information to assist ourselves and investors in understanding the impact of various items on our cash flows  some of which are recurring 
because adjusted free cash flow excludes many items that are included in our financial statements  it does not provide a complete measure of our liquidity

table of contents revenues during the year ended december   net operating revenues from continuing operations increased compared to the year ended december  our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended december  increased by compared to the year ended december  there were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues 
key positive factors include improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts  partially offset by a reduction in stop loss payments to million in from million in  and an increase in total admissions and patient days 
key negative factors include a decrease in commercial managed care admissions  a decrease in dsh payments under various states medicaid programs to million in from million in  and favorable adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances of million in compared to million in same hospital admissions for the year ended december  increased by compared to the year ended december  primarily due to net volume increases in many of the service lines emphasized by our targeted growth initiative  psychiatric volumes at a facility we acquired in modesto  california in november  and a net growth in physicians resulting from our general focus on recruitment efforts and our targeted physician recruitment strategies at various hospitals for specific service lines  partially offset by lower invasive cardiac procedures 
same hospital net outpatient revenues during the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   while outpatient visits declined by for the same periods 
the primary reason for the revenue increase is improved managed care pricing 
salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  same hospital salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately in compared to the increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees  an increase in the number of employed physicians  increased health benefits and retirement plans costs  increased annual incentive compensation costs  and hurricane related labor costs  partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount  a decline in contract labor expenses and stock compensation expense  and improved workers compensation loss experience 
included in salaries  wages and benefits expense in the year ended december  is million of stock based compensation expense compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to the vesting of higher grant date fair value awards from prior years and the issuance of new awards at lower grant date fair values primarily due to our lower stock price 
supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues increased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   supplies expense per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis increased approximately in compared to this increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day reflects higher costs for orthopedics  pharmaceuticals and implants due to increased volumes  inflation and technology improvements  and higher surgical supply costs due to an increase in surgeries  partially offset by lower cardiovascular supply costs  which resulted from a decrease in cardiovascular procedures 

table of contents provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues on a same hospital basis was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the negative impact on bad debts as a result of the growth in self pay accounts assigned to our collection agencies  a slight decline in self pay collection trends since the first half of  pricing increases and improved charge capture in our emergency departments were partially mitigated by improved point of service collections and improved managed care accounts receivable balances by aging category

the comparable self pay collection percentage as of december   adjusted for the reclassification of certain hospitals to discontinued operations  was approximately 
our provision for doubtful accounts in the three months ended december  includes a million unfavorable adjustment in the estimate of necessary bad debt reserve levels at year end compared to a favorable adjustment of million in the three months ended december  the change in anticipated collections as of december  was based on a look back period of months of collections 
our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately at both december  and december   adjusted for hospitals reclassified to discontinued operations  which includes collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors

other operating expenses  net other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased by in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  other operating expenses per adjusted patient day on a same hospital basis increased by approximately in as compared to primarily due to higher physician fees  contracted services  repair and maintenance costs  utility costs and an million gain on a sale of a medical office building in florida in  which reduced other operating expenses  partially offset by lower information systems implementation costs  consulting costs and malpractice expense 
malpractice expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in malpractice expense is principally due to a reduction in the number of expected claims  partially offset by a basis point decline in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million 
we recorded an million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of two hospitals to their estimated fair values due to adverse current and anticipated future financial trends based on their most recent projections at that time 
we believe the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends include shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers and high levels of uninsured patients 
the remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended december  include million of employee severance and other related costs  million for the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and million in impairment charges for the write down of other assets primarily due to the write down of costs associated with an expansion project at one of our hospitals that we decided not to pursue based on unfavorable economics forecasted for the project  partially offset by a million reduction in reserves recorded in prior periods 

table of contents during the year ended december   net impairment and restructuring charges of million included a million net impairment charge primarily for the write down of buildings and equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of one hospital to its estimated fair value due to adverse current and anticipated future financial trends based on its most recent projections at that time 
we believe the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends included reductions in volume from insured patients due to competition and shifts in payer mix  increased uninsured patients  adverse trends in provision for doubtful accounts and reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers 
the remaining net impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended december  include million of employee severance and other related costs  million in lease costs  million for the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and million in impairment charges for the write down of other assets  partially offset by million of insurance proceeds for property damage from hurricane wilma and a million reduction of reserves recorded in prior periods 
litigation and investigation costs  net of insurance recoveries litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the costs primarily relate to changes in our estimated liability for now settled wage and hour actions further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the costs were partially offset by million of insurance proceeds that were recorded as a recovery of litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for costs we previously incurred related to our december redding medical center litigation settlement

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as standby letters of credit and minimum revenue guarantees  are summarized in the table below  all as of december  years ending december  later total years in millions long term debt global civil settlement payable capital lease obligations long term non cancelable operating leases standby letters of credit guarantees asset retirement obligations academic affiliation agreements tax liabilities supplemental executive retirement plan obligations information technology contract services purchase orders total includes interest through maturity date lease termination 
includes minimum revenue guarantees  primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals  and operating lease guarantees 
these agreements contain various rights and termination provisions 

table of contents the standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under certain of our professional and general liability insurance programs 
the amount of collateral required is principally dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness 
the insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers 
the standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility 
in  we refinanced approximately billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt through tender offers and exchange offers 
we also repurchased approximately million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt through privately negotiated transactions and open market repurchases 
these transactions  which were financed with the issuances of new debt securities  the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock and cash on hand  are part of our long term objective to manage the risks associated with our high levels of debt 
we may from time to time seek to retire  purchase  redeem or refinance additional amounts of our outstanding debt subject to prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
these actions are part of our strategy to manage our leverage over time  which is dependent on our total amount of debt  our cash and our operating results  with a long term target to maintain our ratio of total long term debt  net of cash and cash equivalent balances  to adjusted ebitda as defined above at x or below 
at december   using the last months of adjusted ebitda  this ratio was x 
we anticipate this ratio will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on earnings performance and other factors 
we intend to pursue our objectives by following our business plan  managing our cost structure and through other changes in our capital structure  including  if appropriate  the issuance of equity or convertible securities 
our ability to achieve these long term objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  many of which are described in part i  item a  risk factors  of this report 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities  including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations  equipment and information systems additions and replacements  introduction of new medical technologies  design and construction of new buildings  and various other capital improvements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year ending december  will total approximately million to million  including million that was accrued at december   but not paid until our anticipated capital expenditures include approximately million to meet seismic requirements for our california facilities 
we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations  of which approximately million was spent prior to january  our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than certain previous estimates because a number of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using a new seismic evaluation tool 
there may be further reductions to our estimated seismic costs as the state of california has recently enacted new regulations relating to the seismic evaluation tool and the new state building code  we are currently evaluating these new regulations to determine what impact they will have on our cost estimate 
our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for future inflation 
our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending december  also include approximately million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities as a result of a consent decree in a class action lawsuit 
we expect to spend a total of approximately million on such improvements over the next six years 
interest payments  net of capitalized interest  were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to monthly interest payments under our interest rate swap agreement  higher interest rate debt issued during the year and interest payments that were accelerated and paid in the year ended december  as a result of our various long term debt transactions discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which became effective may   for an aggregate notional amount of billion 
the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates 
it had the effect of converting our senior notes due from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid monthly based on the one month libor plus a floating rate spread of approximately 
during the term of the interest rate swap agreement  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the senior notes  which substantially offset each other  were recorded in interest expense 
to mitigate risks related to potential significant increases in the one month libor  we also entered into a separate agreement that limited the maximum one month libor to under the interest rate swap agreement 
in november  we terminated the interest rate swap agreement 
we realized approximately million in net savings in interest payments during the term of the interest rate swap agreement 
depending on then existing market conditions  we may elect to enter into similar interest rate swap agreements in the future 

table of contents income tax payments  net of tax refunds  were approximately million in the year ended december  compared to approximately million during the year ended december  at december   our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion pretax expiring in to  approximately million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration  and general business credit carryforwards of approximately million expiring in to periodic examinations of our tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities could result in the payment of additional taxes 
our tax returns for the years ended december  and december  are currently under examination by the irs 
these returns include deductions for amounts paid in connection with our civil settlement with the federal government and upon which taxes had been paid by us in previous taxable years 
we filed tax refund claims to recover such previously paid taxes  and we received tax refunds of approximately million as of december  the tax treatment of the civil settlement payments is being considered as part of the irs examination 
we presently cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this irs examination  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
furthermore  our ability to utilize nol carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be limited under section of the internal revenue code if certain ownership changes in our company occur during a rolling three year period 
these ownership changes include the offering of stock by us  the purchase or sale of our stock by shareholders  as defined in the treasury regulations  or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire our stock 
if such ownership changes by shareholders result in aggregate increases that exceed percentage points during the three year period  then section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that may be offset by the nol carryforwards 
sources and uses of cash our liquidity for the year ended december  was primarily derived from cash on hand  net cash provided by operating activities  and proceeds from the sale of usc university hospital and usc kenneth norris jr 
cancer hospital 
our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable 
as we experience changes in our business mix and as admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients grow  our operating cash flow is negatively impacted due to lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the and periods include the following additional interest payments of million  primarily due to monthly interest payments under our interest rate swap agreement  higher interest rate debt issued during the year and interest payments that were accelerated and paid in as a result of our various long term debt transactions discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  million we received under our interest rate swap agreement  increased operating income from continuing operations of million  excluding litigation and investigation costs  impairment and restructuring charges  and depreciation and amortization in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   million in payments related to our settlement of wage and hour actions  increased income tax payments of million  including million in settlement of irs audit disputes as discussed above  million of insurance recoveries received in the year ended december  related to our december redding medical center litigation settlement based on the components of the recoveries  million was classified as discontinued operations cash flows from operations and million was classified as continuing operations cash flows from operations  million of additional cash flows related to divested hospitals classified as discontinued operations primarily due to the liquidation of accounts receivable and other working capital balances such amount excludes the million of insurance recoveries received in related to redding medical center discussed above  additional cash flows as a result of enhanced management of account payable million and accounts receivable million

cancer hospital 
excluding the simultaneous purchase and sale of the tarzana campus of encino tarzana regional medical center for million  during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from the sales of facilities and other assets related to discontinued operations  primarily from the sales of north ridge medical center  the encino campus of encino tarzana regional medical center  garden grove hospital and medical center  and san dimas community hospital 
we received proceeds  which are classified as investing activities  of million and million from our investment in hospital authority bonds related to previously divested hospitals in the dallas  texas area during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also received proceeds  which are classified as investing activities  of million during the year ended december  related to the sale of our interest in people s health network and  during the year ended december   of million from the sale of our entire interest in broadlane  inc and million from the sale of our interest in a joint venture with a real estate investment trust 
we continue to seek further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet by generating incremental cash 
these initiatives include the sale of our medical office buildings and excess land  buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets 
we are currently seeking to sell up to of our owned medical office buildings 
however  there is no assurance that we will consummate a sale of these buildings 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  including approximately million and million in the same respective years for construction of sierra providence east medical center  our new hospital in el paso  texas  and a replacement hospital for east cooper regional medical center in mt 
pleasant  south carolina 
we use fair market value to record our investments that are available for sale 
as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements  the majority of our investments are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
however  at december   one of our captive insurance subsidiaries held million principal value of auction rate securities  classified as investments  whose auctions have failed due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
in addition  we held million of investments in the reserve yield plus fund and have reclassified the balance out of cash equivalents as the fund has experienced liquidity issues and temporarily suspended distributions 
the fund is currently in the process of liquidating its investments and distributing cash to its investors 
we expect the fund to liquidate all of its investments  however  the ultimate timing is uncertain 
we will continue to closely monitor our investments  but do not anticipate any future decrease in value of either the auction rate securities or the reserve yield plus fund to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have no other investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the current economic crisis that will materially impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants credit agreement we have a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility  which matures on november   that is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals  and bears interest at our option based on libor plus basis points or citigroup s base rate  as defined in the credit agreement  plus basis points 
the revolving credit agreement contains standard covenants and also includes a provision  which we believe is customary in receivables backed credit facilities  that gives our banks the right to require that proceeds of collections of substantially all of our consolidated accounts receivable be applied directly to repay outstanding loans and other amounts that are due and payable under the revolving credit facility at any time that unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is less than million or if an event of default has occurred and is continuing thereunder 
in that event  we would seek to re borrow under the revolving credit facility to satisfy our operating cash requirements 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to conditions that we believe are customary in such facilities  including that no events of default then exist 
for additional information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our revolving credit agreement 
our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility  based on our eligible receivables  was million at december  at december   there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
we also had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  to fund our operations and capital expenditures

in september  we repurchased approximately million of additional aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due for cash of approximately million 
also in september  we purchased million of the million aggregate principal amount then outstanding of our senior notes due for million 
the purchase was funded with the net proceeds from our september sale of mandatory convertible preferred stock as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the repurchase  we paid approximately million in accrued and unpaid interest 
this transaction resulted in a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes  as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs associated with the notes 
in july  we purchased approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  and million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due for approximately million 
we recorded a gain from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes  partially offset by the write off of unamortized note discounts  issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes 
in june  we purchased approximately million of the billion aggregate principal amount then outstanding of our senior notes due for approximately million  representing approximately million in principal payments and approximately million in accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of purchase 
we purchased the senior notes with the net proceeds of approximately million from our sale of new senior secured notes  as described below  and cash on hand 
in may and march  we exchanged approximately million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due for new senior secured notes due and senior secured notes due  as described below 
for additional information regarding our senior notes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
senior secured notes in june  we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due we will pay interest on the notes semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  commencing january  the senior secured notes rank equally with our senior secured notes due and senior secured notes due  which we issued in may and march  as described below 
in may  we exchanged approximately million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due for approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due and approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due in addition  we received approximately million in cash  which represented the difference in the fair values of the tendered notes as compared to the fair values of the senior secured notes and senior secured notes and compensation to us for increased interest expense 
in march  we exchanged approximately million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due for approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due and approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due interest on these notes is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  commencing on may  the and senior secured notes rank equally with our senior secured notes 

table of contents for additional information regarding our senior secured notes  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate swap agreement we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which became effective may   for an aggregate notional amount of billion 
the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates 
it had the effect of converting our senior notes due from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid monthly based on the one month libor plus a floating rate spread of approximately 
during the term of the interest rate swap agreement  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the senior notes  which substantially offset each other  were recorded in interest expense 
to mitigate risks related to potential significant increases in the one month libor  we also entered into a libor cap agreement that limited the maximum one month libor to under the interest rate swap agreement 
we paid approximately million for this limitation on interest rate exposure under the interest rate swap agreement 
in november  we terminated the interest rate swap agreement 
we realized approximately million in net savings in interest payments during the term of the interest rate swap agreement 
depending on then existing market conditions  we may elect to enter into similar interest rate swap agreements in the future 
liquidity from time to time  we expect to engage in additional capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
we believe our existing agreements provide significant flexibility for future secured or unsecured borrowings 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand  availability under our revolving credit facility  anticipated future cash provided by operating activities  anticipated proceeds from the sales of assets held for sale  and our investments in marketable securities of our captive insurance companies classified as noncurrent investments on our balance sheet should be adequate to meet our current cash needs 
these sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures  payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs 
long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities  results of balance sheet initiatives previously discussed and  given favorable market conditions  future borrowings or refinancings 
however  our cash requirements could be materially affected by a deterioration in our results of operations  as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections  which could require us to pursue any number of financing options  including  but not limited to  additional borrowings  debt refinancing  asset sales or other financing alternatives 
with the current tight credit markets  the level  if any  of these financing sources cannot be assured  and the ability of our counterparties to close asset sales as previously anticipated could also be affected 
we continue to aggressively identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance  including cash flow 
among the areas being addressed are volume growth  managed care payer contracting  procurement efficiencies  cost standardization  bad debt expense reduction initiatives  underperforming hospitals  and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care 
although these initiatives may result in improved performance  that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios 
off balance sheet arrangements excluding the hospitals whose operating results are included in discontinued operations  our consolidated operating results for the years ended december   and include million  million and million  respectively  of net operating revenues and million  million and million  respectively  of income from operations generated from four general hospitals operated by us under lease arrangements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the applicable buildings and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as they are considered operating leases 
the current terms of these leases expire between and  not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise 
if these leases expire  we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from these hospitals 

table of contents we have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except for million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of december  recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use 
in general  we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  given the particular circumstances in which we operate 
actual results may vary from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  and may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions 
our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas recognition of net operating revenues  including contractual allowances  provisions for doubtful accounts  accruals for general and professional liability risks  accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans  accruals for litigation losses  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed 
net operating revenues primarily consist of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates ie  gross charges  less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances  principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans  as well as uninsured patients under the compact 
revenues under the traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in earlier periods  and certain other payments  such as dsh  dgme  ime and bad debt expense  which are based on our hospitals cost reports  are estimated using historical trends and current factors 
cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review  and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved 
because the laws  regulations  instructions and rule interpretations governing medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently  the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts 
we have a system and estimation process for recording medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements 
this results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports 
for filed cost reports  we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports  and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 

table of contents revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans 
a increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances would impact the estimated reserves by million 
some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include changes in reimbursement levels for procedures  supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered  changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached  changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing  final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels  secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments  and reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels 
contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the compact  whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements 
we know of no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
provisions for doubtful accounts although outcomes vary  our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients  including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
generally  as required by emtala  patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay 
therefore  services  including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient  are performed without delaying to obtain insurance information 
in non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services  it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated  however  there are various exceptions that can occur 
such exceptions can include  for example  instances where we are unable to obtain verification because the patient s insurance company was unable to be reached or contacted  a determination is made that a patient may be eligible for benefits under various government programs  such as medicaid or victims of crime  and it takes several days or weeks before qualification for such benefits is confirmed or denied  and under physician orders we provide services to patients that require immediate treatment 
we provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital  our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an month look back period  and other relevant factors 
based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at december   a hypothetical decline in our self pay collection rate  or approximately  would result in an unfavorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
there are various factors that can impact collection trends  such as changes in the economy  which in turn have an impact on unemployment rates and the number of uninsured and underinsured patients  the volume of patients through the emergency department  the increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients with insurance  and business practices related to collection efforts 
these factors continuously change and can have an impact on collection trends and our estimation process 
our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable  including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing 
generally  uncollected balances are assigned to our in house collection agency between to days  once patient responsibility has been identified 
when accounts are assigned to the collection agency by the hospital  the accounts are completely written off the hospital s books through the provision for doubtful accounts  and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospital s books at the same time 
the estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates 
the estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our in house collection agency 

table of contents managed care accounts are collected through our regional business offices  whereby the account balances remain in the hospital s patient accounting system and on the hospital s books  and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age 
managed care accounts collected through our regional business offices are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years 
changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts 
we continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings 
we aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal  including arbitration and litigation  but we may not be successful 
accruals for general and professional liability risks we accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims  to the extent not covered by insurance  when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we maintain reserves  which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks  including incurred but not reported claims  to the extent we do not have insurance coverage 
our liability consists of estimates established based upon discounted actuarial calculations using several factors  including the number of expected claims  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  the timing of historical payments  and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of projected payments 
we consider the number of expected claims  average cost per claim and discount rate to be the most significant assumptions in estimating accruals for general and professional liabilities 
our liabilities are adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known 
malpractice expense is recorded within other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
our estimated reserves for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be a increase or decrease in the number of expected claims or average cost per claim 
a increase in the number of expected claims would increase the estimated reserves by million  and a decrease in the number of expected claims would decrease the estimated reserves by million 
a increase in the average cost per claim would increase the estimated reserves by million  and a decrease in the average cost per claim would decrease the estimated reserves by million 
because our estimated reserves for future claim payments are discounted to present value  a change in our discount rate assumption could also have a significant impact on our estimated reserves 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the estimated reserves by million 
in addition  because of the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates 
the table below shows the case reserves and incurred but not reported claims reserves as of december   and december  case reserves incurred but not reported reserves total undiscounted reserves several actuarial methods  including incurred  paid loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods  are applied to our historical loss data to produce estimates of ultimate expected losses and the resulting incurred but not reported reserves 
these methods use our specific historical claims data related to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses  historical and current case reserves  reported and closed claim counts  and a variety of hospital census information 
based on these analyses  we determine our estimate of the professional liability claims  including the incurred but not reported reserve estimate 
the determination of our estimates involves subjective judgment and could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods if our actual experience is materially different than our assumptions 
malpractice claims generally take to years to settle from the time of the initial reporting of the occurrence to the settlement payment 
accordingly  the percentage of reserves as of december  representing unsettled claims is approximately compared to as of december  
table of contents the following table presents the amount of our accruals for professional liability claims and the corresponding activity therein for each of the respective years presented below 
years ended december  accrual for professional liability claims  beginning of the year expense income related to current accident year prior accident years expense income from discounting total incurred loss and loss expense paid claims and expenses related to current accident year prior accident years total paid claims and expenses accrual for professional liability claims  end of year accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts 
the discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
our discount rate for both and was 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
a one hundred basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for by million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one hundred basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would increase net periodic pension expense for by million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 
accruals for litigation losses we record reserves for litigation losses if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss 
if a range of loss can be reasonably estimated  but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
these estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we calculate the amount of an impairment if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals  established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable 
they require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates 
these assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell 
in such circumstances  our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows 

table of contents these fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods 
many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates  including the following risks future financial results of our hospitals  which can be impacted by volumes of insured patients and declines in commercial managed care patients  terms of managed care payer arrangements  our ability to collect accounts due from uninsured and managed care payers  loss of volumes as a result of competition  and our ability to manage costs such as labor costs  which can be adversely impacted by union activity and the shortage of experienced nurses  changes in payments from governmental health care programs and in government regulations such as reductions to medicare and medicaid payment rates resulting from government legislation or rule making or from budgetary challenges of states in which we operate  how the hospitals are operated in the future  and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets 
we recorded a net impairment charge of million for one hospital during for the write down of buildings  equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates 
material adverse trends in our most recent estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital  consistent with our prior estimates during when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believe the most significant factors contributing to the continuing adverse financial trends include reductions in volumes of insured patients due to competition  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair values of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying values of the hospital s long lived assets 
because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the hospital s long lived assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improve to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying values of the long lived assets  this hospital is at risk of future impairments  particularly if we spend significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospital s fair value or if the fair value of the hospital s real estate continues to decline 
we also recorded a million net impairment charge for the write down of land and buildings at the current campus of one hospital that is scheduled to move to a new  replacement campus during our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from use of the current campus for several months during and from estimated disposition proceeds were less than the carrying values of the land and buildings at the current campus 
we compared the estimated fair values to the carrying values and  because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying values of the assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
additionally  in our most recent impairment analysis as of december   we had two hospitals with an aggregate carrying value of long lived assets of approximately million whose estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets by an aggregate amount of approximately million 
these two hospitals had the smallest excess of future estimated undiscounted cash flows over carrying value 
changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates of future undiscounted cash flows could result in the estimated cash flows being less than the carrying value of the assets  which would require a fair value assessment of the long lived assets  and if the fair value amount is less than the carrying value of the assets  impairment charges would occur and could be material 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually 
for goodwill  we perform the test at the reporting unit level  as defined by applicable accounting standards  when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value  then we reduce the carrying value  including any allocated goodwill  to fair value 
estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 

table of contents our continuing operations are structured as follows our california region includes all of our hospitals in california and nebraska  our central region includes all of our hospitals in missouri  tennessee and texas  our florida region includes all of our hospitals in florida  our southern states region includes all of our hospitals in alabama  georgia  north carolina and south carolina  and our two hospitals in philadelphia  pennsylvania are part of a separate market 
these regions and market are reporting units used to perform our goodwill impairment analysis and are one level below our operating segment level 
future restructuring of our regions or markets that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
our goodwill balance is primarily related to our southern states region  which totals approximately million  and our central region  which totals approximately million 
in our latest impairment analysis as of december   the estimated fair value of these regions exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets  including goodwill  by approximately and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  adjusted for certain nonrecurring items  income losses expected in future years  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels  the availability  or lack thereof  of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits  the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
during the year ended december   the income tax valuation allowance decreased by million primarily as a result of current year net income against which deferred tax assets were realized and the write off of deferred tax assets related to stock based compensation that would otherwise have been charged against additional paid in capital 
as of december   we concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately billion was required primarily as a result of negative evidence represented by cumulative losses during the three year period ended december  in  our operating results improved considerably and  if our operating results continue to improve in  we may no longer have cumulative losses for purposes of this analysis 
in that case  our judgment about the need for a valuation allowance may change in the near term and  if so  some or all of the valuation allowance may be reduced and recorded as a benefit in income tax expense from continuing operations 
we cannot predict at this time when or if the valuation allowance will be reduced 
we consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions  and such judgments are subject to periodic review 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 

table of contents while we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities  adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method  under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees  directors  advisors and consultants is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards  whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a binomial lattice model 
the key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include expected volatility  expected dividend yield  expected life  expected forfeiture rate  risk free interest rate range  early exercise threshold  and early exercise rate 
the expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options 
the expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options  and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges 
the historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period october  through december  due to unique events occurring during that time  which caused extreme volatility of our stock price 
the expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding 
this model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price 
the risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon united states treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes 
the most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option  because it  in turn  is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates 
accordingly  we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date 
our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns
