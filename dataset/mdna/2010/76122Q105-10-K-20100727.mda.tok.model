we were founded in june by a team at deloitte touche  led by our chief executive officer  donald b 
murray  who was then a senior partner with deloitte touche 
our founders created resources connection to capitalize on the increasing demand for high quality outsourced professional services 
we operated as a part of deloitte touche from our inception in june until april in april  we completed a management led buyout 
in december  we completed our initial public offering of common stock and began trading on the nasdaq 
we currently trade on the nasdaq global select market 
in january  we announced the change of our operating entity name to resources global professionals to better reflect the company s international capabilities 
we operated solely in the united states until fiscal year  when we began to expand geographically to meet the demand for project professional services across the world and opened our first three international offices 
our most significant international transaction to date was the acquisition of our netherland practice in fiscal year as of may   we served clients through offices in the united states and offices abroad 
in november  we acquired certain assets of sitrick and company  a strategic communications firm and brincko associates  inc  a corporate advisory and restructuring firm with operations primarily in the united states  through the purchase of all of the outstanding membership interests in sitrick brincko group 
we paid cash of approximately million and issued an aggregated of  shares of restricted common stock  valued at approximately million  to sitrick and company  brincko associates and michael sitrick collectively  the sellers for the acquisition 
we believe this acquisition provides a significant opportunity for us to expand our service offerings to include corporate advisory  strategic communications and restructuring services  using the expertise of personnel of sitrick brincko group leveraged with the skills of our consultant base  our geographic footprint and our client base 
the acquisition agreement provides an opportunity to the sellers to receive contingent consideration following the fourth anniversary of the acquisition  provided that sitrick brincko group s average annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda over a period of four years following the acquisition date exceeds million 
we expect to continue opportunistic international expansion while also investing in complementary professional services lines that we believe will augment our service offerings 
we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our consultants 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients on a weekly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our consultants 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process and represented  and of our revenue for the years ended may   may  and may   respectively 
we periodically review our outstanding accounts receivable balance and determine an estimate of the amount of those receivables we believe may prove uncollectible 
our provision for bad debts is included in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the costs to pay our professional consultants and all related benefit and incentive costs  including provisions for paid time off and other employee benefits  are included in direct cost of services 
we pay most of our consultants on an hourly basis for all hours worked on client engagements and  therefore  direct cost of services tends to vary directly with the volume of revenue we earn 
we expense the benefits we pay to our consultants as they are earned 

table of contents these benefits include paid time off and holidays  a discretionary bonus plan  subsidized group health  dental  vision and life insurance programs  a matching k retirement plan  the ability to participate in the company s espp  and professional development and career training 
in addition  we pay the related costs of employment  including state and federal payroll taxes  workers compensation insurance  unemployment insurance and other costs 
typically  a consultant must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of the benefits 
we recognize direct cost of services when incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the payroll and related costs of our internal management as well as general and administrative  marketing and recruiting costs 
our sales and marketing efforts are led by our management team who are salaried employees and earn bonuses based on operating results for the company as a whole and within each individual s geographic market 
the company s fiscal year consists of or weeks  ending on the saturday in may closest to may fiscal and consisted of weeks each 
for fiscal years of weeks  such as fiscal  the first three quarters consist of weeks each and the fourth quarter consists of weeks 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not subject to periodic amortization 
these assets are considered to have an indefinite life and their carrying values are required to be assessed by us for impairment at least annually 
depending on future market values of our stock  our operating performance and other factors  these assessments could potentially result in impairment reductions of these intangible assets in the future and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 
contingent consideration the company estimates and records the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration as part of purchase price consideration for acquisitions occurring subsequent to may  additionally  each reporting period  the company estimates changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and any change in fair value is recognized in the statement of operations 
the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration requires very subjective assumptions to be made of future operating results  discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential operating result scenarios 
future revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration and therefore materially affect the company s future financial results 
under the terms of our acquisition agreement for sitrick brincko group  the sellers have the opportunity to receive contingent consideration subsequent to the fourth anniversary of the acquisition  provided that sitrick brincko group s average annual ebitda over a period of four years following the acquisition date exceeds million 
the range of the undiscounted amounts the company could be obligated to pay as contingent consideration under the earn out arrangement is between and an unlimited amount 
the estimated fair value of the contractual obligation to pay the contingent consideration recognized as of may  was million 
the company determined the fair value of the obligation to pay contingent consideration based on probability weighted projections of the average ebitda during the four year earn out measurement period 
the resultant probability weighted average ebitda amounts were then multiplied by representing the agreed upon multiple to be paid by the company as specified in the acquisition agreements and then discounted using an original discount rate of 
each reporting period  the 
table of contents company will estimate changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and any change in fair value will be recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  under the terms of our acquisition agreements for sitrick brincko group  up to of the contingent consideration is payable to employees of the acquired business at the end of the measurement period to the extent certain growth targets are achieved 
the company will record the estimated amount of the contractual obligation to pay the employee portion of the contingent consideration as compensation expense over the service period as it is deemed probable that the growth targets will be achieved 
the estimate of the amount of the employee portion of contingent consideration requires very subjective assumptions to be made of future operating results 
future revisions to these assumptions could materially change our estimate of the amount of the employee portion of contingent consideration and therefore materially affect the company s future financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our clients failing to make required payments for services rendered 
we estimate this allowance based upon our knowledge of the financial condition of our clients which may not include knowledge of all significant events  review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could cause unfavorable trends in receivable collections and additional allowances may be required 
these additional allowances could materially affect the company s future financial results 
income taxes in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates of income taxes  if applicable  in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of any current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we will establish a valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in recording additional tax expense and any such adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial result 
if the ultimate tax liability differs from the amount of tax expense we have reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  an adjustment of tax expense may need to be recorded and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 
revenue recognition we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our consultants 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients in the united states on a weekly basis 
some of our clients served by our international operations are billed on a monthly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our consultants 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process 
stock based compensation under our performance incentive plan  officers  employees  and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock  stock units  options to purchase common stock or other stock or stock based awards 
under our espp  eligible officers and employees may purchase our common stock in accordance with the terms of the plan 
effective may   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions required for stock based awards using the modified prospective transition method  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated 
under the previously accepted accounting standards  there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases recognized during periods prior to may  in accordance with the required accounting guidance  the company estimates a value for employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
additional variables to be considered are the expected term and risk free interest rate over the expected term of our employee stock options 
in addition  because stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures must be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in 
table of contents subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense recorded may differ materially from the amount recorded in the current period 
the weighted average estimated value per share of employee stock options granted during the years ended may  and may  were and  respectively  using the black scholes model with the following assumptions year ended year ended may  may  expected volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends expected life years years the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our historical policy of not paying dividends except for a one time payment in fiscal 
expected dividends will need to be incorporated in the assessment of the company s future stock option grants given the company s announcement that it will commence a regular quarterly dividend in fiscal the company s historical expected life of stock option grants is years for non officers and years for officers 
as permitted under staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company uses its historical volatility over the expected life of the stock option award to estimate the expected volatility of the price of its common stock 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of operations data 
these historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results

revenue direct cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses employee portion of contingent consideration expense contingent consideration expense amortization of intangible assets depreciation expense loss income from operations interest income loss income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income we also assess the results of our operations using ebitda as well as adjusted ebitda  which is our earnings loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and contingent consideration expense adjusted ebitda 
these measures assist management in assessing our core operating performance

all other years presented were comprised of weeks 
the financial measures and key performance indicators we use to assess our financial and operating performance above are not defined by  or calculated in accordance  with gaap 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that i excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of operations  or ii includes amounts  or is subject to 
table of contents adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure 
adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by revenue 
we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide useful information to our investors because they are financial measures used by management to assess the core performance of the company 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for net income or other cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity 
these measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  net income  earnings per share  cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in conformity with gaap 
further  adjusted ebitda has the following limitations although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  equity based compensation is an element of our long term incentive compensation program  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon our results  as rounded and presented herein 
revenue 
revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  included in revenue for the year ended may  was approximately million from the operations of sitrick brincko group  acquired november  our revenue was adversely affected by a decline in the number of hours worked by our consultants and a minor decrease in the average bill rate per hour in comparison to the prior year 
we believe the primary cause of the decrease in hours worked by our consultants is client uncertainty about the global economic environment  which is causing our clients to approach their need for professional business services more cautiously and to either defer  downsize or eliminate projects 
the number of hours worked in fiscal declined about from the prior year  while average bill rates decreased by compared to the prior year 
the number of consultants on assignment at the end of fiscal was  compared to the  consultants engaged at the end of fiscal although we believe we have improved the awareness of our service offerings with clients and prospective clients through our completed and on going engagements  and that the significant changes taking place in the capital markets may present new opportunities going forward  there can be no assurance about the timing of such opportunities or whether we can successfully capitalize on them  especially given the current uncertain economic climate in the united states and international markets 
on a sequential quarter basis  fiscal fourth quarter revenues improved from million to million and hours improved 
the improvement in hours is partially attributable to the lack of significant holidays in the united states in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter  which included the christmas and new year s holidays 
the improvement in revenues from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of fiscal had a positive impact on leverage  evidenced by improvement in the ratio of direct cost of services to revenue from to  and the ratio of selling  general and administrative expenses to revenue  improving from to  for the quarters ended february  and may   respectively 
however  a downturn or softening in global economic conditions and the seasonal impact of the summer holiday period could put resulting pressure on revenue in the first 
table of contents quarter of fiscal  limiting our ability to leverage direct cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we operated offices at both may  and may  our clients do not sign long term contracts with us 
as such  there can be no assurance as to future demand levels for the services that we provide or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends 
revenue for the company s major practice areas across the globe consisted of the following dollars in thousands revenue for the year ended of total may  may  may  may  change north america europe asia pacific total our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
revenues denominated in foreign currencies are translated into united states dollars at the monthly average exchange rates in effect during the quarter 
thus  as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non us based operations  our revenue can be impacted 
using the comparable fiscal and fiscal conversion rates  international revenues would have been lower than reported under gaap by million for the year ended may  but higher than reported under gaap by million for the year ended may  we believe our revenues in the near term will continue to be impacted by the global economic environment which has reduced our clients demand for many of the services we provide 
direct cost of services 
direct cost of services decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  direct cost of services declined primarily because of a decrease in hours worked compared to the prior year 
to a lesser extent  direct cost of services declined because the average pay rate per hour to our consultants was down 
the direct cost of services as a percentage of revenue the direct cost of services percentage was and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
the improvement in the direct cost of services percentage resulted primarily from the blended impact of work performed for sitrick brincko group clients and a decrease in zero margin client reimbursements 
our target direct cost of services percentage is for all of our offices 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  s  g a increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  management and administrative head count was at the end of fiscal but fell to at the end of fiscal s  g a decreases in fiscal as compared to fiscal included a reduction in marketing expenses  a reduction in recruiting related expenses  salary  benefit and related costs reflective of the decreased headcount  bonus expense bonus expense is substantially tied directly to the company s revenue and stock based compensation expense 
in addition  in the prior fiscal year  the company s s  g a included approximately million related to severance costs  leasehold improvement write offs and estimated lease termination accruals  all associated with a restructuring program  and the company added million to its allowance for doubtful accounts  in fiscal  the company made no restructuring provision nor did it add to its allowance for doubtful accounts after an evaluation of the company s client base and outstanding receivable balances 
in fiscal  the company incurred million in severance costs and million of accelerated compensation expense from the vesting of certain stock option grants related to the resignation of two senior executives 

table of contents employee portion of contingent consideration expense and contingent consideration expense 
the employee portion of contingent consideration expense and contingent consideration expense were  and million  respectively  for the year ended may  as further described in critical accounting policies contingent consideration above  these estimates were recorded in fiscal as a result of management s evaluation of the amount of contingent consideration owed to employees related to the sitrick brincko group acquisition in the case of the employee portion of contingent consideration and the change in the estimated value of contingent consideration attributable to the time value of money accretion and a slight change in the discount rate applied in the calculation in the case of contingent consideration expense 
both of these estimates require very subjective assumptions to be made of various potential operating result scenarios and future revision to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the amount of either liability and therefore materially affect the company s future financial results and financial condition 
amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is the result of commencing amortization related to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the november purchase of sitrick brincko group 
those assets include million for customer relationships  million for trade names  million for non competition agreements and  for customer backlog 
the backlog will be amortized over months  the customer relationships over two years  and the trade names and non competition agreements over five years 
based upon identified intangible assets recorded at may   the company anticipates amortization expense related to identified intangible assets to approximate million during the fiscal year ending may  depreciation expense decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  depreciation decreased as a number of assets were fully depreciated during fiscal and the company has slowed the amount invested in property and equipment in fiscal as compared to previous fiscal years 
interest income 
interest income declined to  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income is the result of a lower average cash balance available for investment during fiscal  and declining interest rates as compared to fiscal the company has invested available cash in certificates of deposit  money market investments and government agency bonds that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
as of may   the company has million of investments in commercial paper and certificates of deposit with remaining maturity dates between three months and one year from the balance sheet date classified as short term investments and considered held to maturity securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the provision declined primarily because of a reduction in the company s income before provision for income taxes in fiscal as compared to fiscal despite the company s consolidated pre tax loss  the provision for taxes partially results from taxes on income in the united states and certain other foreign jurisdictions  a lower benefit for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rates  and no benefit for losses in jurisdictions in which a valuation allowance on operating loss carryforwards had previously been established 
as a result  the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate increased because the company s loss in fiscal disproportionally magnifies the effect of the components of the tax rate that differ from the standard federal rate  including non deductible permanent differences and incentive stock options isos 
in addition  in fiscal  the company recorded a million tax charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain foreign operating loss carryforwards 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million tax charge comprised of the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain foreign operating loss carryforwards of million and for the company s forgiveness of certain intercompany debt in france  thereby reducing france s operating loss carryforwards by million 
based upon current economic circumstances  management will continue to monitor the need to record additional valuation allowances in the future  primarily related to certain foreign jurisdictions 
periodically  the company reviews the components of both book and taxable income to analyze the adequacy of the tax provision 
there can be no assurance  because of the lower benefit from the us statutory rate for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions  the limitation on the benefit for losses in jurisdictions in which a valuation allowance 
table of contents for operating loss carryforwards has previously been established  and the unpredictability of timing and the amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises  that the company s effective tax rate will remain constant in the future 
under accounting rules governing stock awards  the company cannot recognize a tax benefit for certain iso grants unless and until the holder exercises his or her option and then sells the shares within a certain period of time 
in addition  the company can only recognize a potential tax benefit for employees acquisition and subsequent sale of shares purchased through the espp if the sale occurs within a certain defined period 
as a result  the company s provision for income taxes is likely to fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
further  those tax benefits associated with iso grants fully vested at the date of adoption of the current accounting rules governing stock awards will be recognized as additions to paid in capital when and if those options are exercised and not as a reduction to the company s tax provision 
the company recognized a benefit of approximately million and million related to stock based compensation for nonqualified stock options expensed and for eligible disqualifying iso exercises during fiscal and  respectively 
the proportion of expense related to non qualified stock option grants for which the company may recognize a tax benefit in the same quarter as the related compensation expense in most instances increased during fiscal as compared to expense related to isos including espps 
however  the timing and amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises cannot be predicted 
the company predominantly grants nonqualified stock options to employees in the united states 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon our results  as rounded and presented herein 
revenue 
revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  our revenue was adversely affected by a decline in the number of hours worked by our consultants offset by a minor increase in the average bill rate per hour in comparison to the prior year 
we believe the primary cause of the decrease in hours worked by our consultants is client uncertainty about the global economic environment  which is causing clients to approach their business more cautiously and to either defer  downsize or eliminate projects 
in addition  fiscal consisted of weeks while fiscal consisted of weeks 
revenues during the fifty third week of fiscal  which included the memorial day holiday in the united states  were million 
the number of hours worked in fiscal declined about from the prior year  while average bill rates increased by compared to the prior year 
the number of consultants on assignment at the end of fiscal was  compared to the  consultants engaged at the end of fiscal we operated and offices as of may  and may   respectively 
revenue for the company s major practice areas across the globe consisted of the following dollars in thousands revenue for the year ended of total may  may  may  may  change north america europe asia pacific total on a constant currency basis  international revenues would have been higher by million and lower by million in fiscal and  respectively  using the comparable fiscal and fiscal conversion rates 
direct cost of services 
direct cost of services decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  direct cost of services declined because of a decrease in hours worked compared to the prior year 
the average pay rate of our consultants 
table of contents was flat 
the direct cost of services percentage was and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
although the direct cost of services percentage improved slightly over the prior year  a continuing lower level of revenues will put increased pressure on this calculation as consultants earn certain benefits  such as health care services  which are relatively fixed in terms of cost 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
s  g a decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  s  g a increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  management and administrative head count was at the end of fiscal but fell to at the end of fiscal s  g a decreases in fiscal as compared to fiscal included a reduction in marketing expenses  a reduction in recruiting and related expenses  salary  benefit and related costs  bonus expense and stock based compensation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in the company s provision for doubtful accounts after an evaluation of the company s client base  receivable balances and the current economic environment and the actions taken in the fourth quarter discussed in the following paragraph 
as a result of reduced revenue levels experienced beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  the company announced in its fourth quarter of fiscal a reduction in headcount and the consolidation of seven offices whose clients could be served from other offices within a close proximity 
in connection with these actions  the company recorded a charge in s  g a of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to severance costs  leasehold improvements write offs and estimated lease termination accruals 
amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is attributable to a full year of amortization related to identified intangible assets acquired its fiscal purchases of compliance solutions and domenica and amounts related to the fiscal acquisitions of limbus and kompetensslussen 
the company considered a number of factors in performing these studies  including the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets 
the total intangible assets acquired included for limbus  approximately million of goodwill   for customer relationships amortized over two years   for a non compete agreement amortized over one year and  for a database of potential consultants amortized over two years  for kompetensslussen  approximately  of goodwill   for customer relationships amortized over two years and  for a non compete agreement amortized over one year  for compliance solutions  approximately million of goodwill   for a non compete agreement amortized over one year and  for customer relationships amortized over five years  and for domenica  approximately million for goodwill  million for customer relationships amortized over seven years and  for a database of potential consultants amortized over five years 
depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the increase in depreciation was related to a higher asset base due to the investments made in offices relocated or expanded since may  and investments in the company s operating system and other it 
interest income 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income is the result of a lower average cash balance available for investment during fiscal and declining interest rates as compared to fiscal the company has invested available cash in certificates of deposit  money market investments and government agency bonds that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the provision declined primarily because of a reduction in the company s pretax income in fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset in part by an increase in the company s effective tax rate between the two years 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate increased because the company s lower pre tax income disproportionally magnifies the effect of non deductible permanent differences and isos 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million tax charge comprised of the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain foreign operating loss carryforwards of million and for the company s forgiveness of certain intercompany debt in france  thereby reducing france s operating loss carryforwards by million 

table of contents the company recognized a benefit of approximately million and million related to stock based compensation for nonqualified stock options expensed and for eligible disqualifying iso exercises during fiscal and  respectively 
the proportion of expense related to non qualified stock option grants for which the company may recognize a tax benefit in the same quarter as the related compensation expense in most instances increased during fiscal as compared to expense related to isos including espps 
however  the timing and amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises cannot be predicted

net income loss per common share calculations for each of the quarters were based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding for each period  and the sum of the quarters may not necessarily be equal to the full year net income loss per common share amount 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and we believe they will continue to do so in the future 
certain factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described in part i item a 
risk factors 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by our operations and  historically  to a lesser extent  stock option exercises 
we have generated positive cash flows annually from operations since inception  and we continued to do so during the year ended may   despite our revenue decrease of and net loss of million 
our ability to continue to increase positive cash flow from operations in the future will be  at least in part  dependent on improvement in global economic conditions

at may   the company had no capital leases 
the following table summarizes our future minimum rental commitments under operating leases and our other known contractual obligations as of may  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years amounts in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows the company to choose the interest rate applicable to advances 
the interest rate options are bank of america s prime rate and a london inter bank offered rate libor plus 
interest  if any  is payable monthly 
the credit agreement expires november  as of may   the company had approximately million available under the terms of the credit agreement as bank of america has issued approximately million of outstanding letters of credit in favor of third parties related to operating leases

operating activities provided million in cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal resulted from a net loss of million and net unfavorable cash changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by favorable non cash items of million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted from net income of million plus favorable non cash items of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the primary cause of the unfavorable change in operating cash flows between the two years was the company s net loss in fiscal  as well as the slight increase in the company s receivable balances between fiscal and as compared to the steep drop in 
table of contents receivables between fiscal and as revenues slowed 
the principal reason for the increase in the accounts receivable balance from the prior year is receivables of sitrick brincko group 
as a result of reductions in headcount and bonus accruals  the liability for accrued salaries and related obligations also declined between fiscal and non cash items include expense for stock based compensation and contingent consideration expense  these charges do not reflect an actual cash outflow from the company but are an estimate of the fair value of the services provided by employees and directors in exchange for stock option grants and purchase of stock through the company s espp and the change in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the time value of money and changes in discount rates 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at may  net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the primary reason for the increased usage in fiscal was cash used to acquire sitrick brincko group of approximately million net of cash acquired  in contrast  million was used in fiscal for three small acquisitions 
cash received from the redemption of short term investments primarily commercial paper and government agency investments  net of cash used to purchase short term investments  resulted in a source of cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company spent approximately million less on property and equipment in fiscal  compared to fiscal as described in note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements  we will be required to pay to the sellers of sitrick brincko group contingent consideration following the fourth anniversary of the acquisition after november if the average ebitda calculated from each of the four one year periods following the acquisition date exceeds million 
if  at the end of the four year earn out period  the company determines that the average annual ebitda exceeded million  then the contingent consideration payable will be determined by multiplying the average annual ebitda by 
the company may  in its sole discretion  pay up to of any earn out payment in restricted stock of the company 
for the six months ended may   sitrick brincko group s ebitda was approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended may   compared to million for the year ended may  the company received approximately million from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of shares via the company s espp compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
however  the company used less cash in fiscal million to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock as compared to million to purchase  shares of common stock in fiscal subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company s board of directors announced it had authorized the establishment of a regular quarterly dividend of per share  payable on september  to shareholders of record at the close of business on august   subject to quarterly approval by the board 
based on shares outstanding as of july   the quarterly dividend obligation at per share would be approximately million 
our ongoing operations and anticipated growth in the geographic markets we currently serve will require us to continue to make investments in capital equipment  primarily technology hardware and software 
in addition  we may consider making strategic acquisitions 
we anticipate that our current cash and the ongoing cash flows from our operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  either internally or through acquisition  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or to secure debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or certain forms of debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
in the event we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed  we may be compelled to delay or curtail our plans to develop our business or to pay dividends on our capital stock  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations  market position and competitiveness 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
securities that the company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
these securities consist of commercial paper and government agency bonds 
cost approximates market for these securities 
the earnings on these investments are subject to changes in interest rates  however  assuming a constant balance available for investment  a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income but would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
for the year ended may   approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside of the united states 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into united states dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
thus  as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non united states based operations  our reported results may vary 
assets and liabilities of our non united states based operations are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate effective at the end of each monthly reporting period 
approximately of our fiscal year end balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were denominated in united states dollars 
the remaining amount of approximately was comprised primarily of cash balances translated from japanese yen  euros  hong kong dollars or british pounds 
the difference resulting from the translation each period of assets and liabilities of our non united states based operations is recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss gain 
although we intend to monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we do not currently use financial hedging techniques to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
