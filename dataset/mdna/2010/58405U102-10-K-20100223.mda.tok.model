table of contents accounts receivable 
the company separately reports accounts receivable due from manufacturers and accounts receivable due from clients 
manufacturer accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from manufacturers for earned rebates and other prescription services 
unbilled rebates receivable from manufacturers are generally billed beginning days from the end of each quarter 
client accounts receivable  net  includes billed and estimated unbilled receivables from clients for the pbm and specialty pharmacy segments 
unbilled pbm receivables are primarily from clients and are typically billed within days based on the contractual billing schedule agreed upon with each client 
at the end of any given reporting period  unbilled pbm receivables from clients may represent up to two weeks of dispensing activity and will fluctuate at the end of a fiscal month depending on the timing of these billing cycles 
client accounts receivable  net  also includes a reduction for rebates and guarantees payable to clients when such are settled on a net basis in the form of an invoice credit 
in cases where rebates and guarantees are settled with the client on a net basis  and the rebates and guarantees payable are greater than the corresponding client accounts receivable balances  the net liability is reclassified to client rebates and guarantees payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
when these payables are settled in the form of a check or wire  they are recorded on a gross basis and the entire liability is reflected in client rebates and guarantees payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s client accounts receivable also includes receivables from cms for the company s medicare part d prescription drug program medicare part d product offerings and premiums from members 
a component of the pbm business includes diabetes supplies dispensed by polymedica with the associated receivables primarily reimbursed from insurance companies and government agencies 
as a result  this component of the pbm business experiences slower accounts receivable turnover 
as of december  and december   identified net specialty pharmacy accounts receivable  primarily due from payors and patients  amounted to million and million  respectively 
a portion of the specialty pharmacy business includes reimbursement by payors  such as insurance companies  under a medical benefit  or by medicare or medicaid 
these transactions also involve higher patient co payments than experienced in the pbm business 
as a result  this portion of the specialty pharmacy business  which yields a higher margin than the pbm business  experiences slower accounts receivable turnover than in the aforementioned pbm cycle and has a different credit risk profile 
see note  segment and geographic data  for more information on the specialty pharmacy segment 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and december  of million and million  respectively  includes million and million  respectively  related to the specialty pharmacy segment 
the relatively higher allowance for the specialty pharmacy segment reflects a different credit risk profile than the pbm business  and is characterized by reimbursement through medical coverage  including government agencies  and higher patient co payments 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and december  also includes million and million  respectively  related to polymedica for diabetes supplies  which are primarily reimbursed by insurance companies and government agencies 
in addition  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts also reflects amounts associated with member premiums for the company s medicare part d product offerings 
the company regularly reviews and analyzes the adequacy of the allowances based on a variety of factors  including the age of the outstanding receivable and the collection history 
when circumstances related to specific collection patterns change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted 
the increase in the reserve balance reflects increased coverage of aged balances 
concentrations of risks 
in  and  the company had one client that represented  and of net revenues  respectively 
the client has a strong investment grade rating and has consistently paid their receivable balance within the contracted payment terms 
none of the company s other clients individually represented more than of net revenues or net client accounts receivable in  or the company has credit risk associated with certain accounts receivable  which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies  insurance companies and private patients 
the company has clients in various industries  including the automobile manufacturer industry and the financial industry  as well as governmental agencies 
the company actively monitors the status of its accounts receivable and has mechanisms in place to minimize the potential for incurring material accounts receivable credit risk 
concentration of credit risk relating to these accounts receivable  excluding the largest client noted above  is limited by the diversity and number of patients and payors 

table of contents as of december  and december   two brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers represented approximately and of manufacturer accounts receivable  net  respectively 
both manufacturers have strong investment grade ratings and have consistently paid their receivable balance within the contracted payment terms 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant deterioration in its client or manufacturer accounts receivables 
the company purchases its pharmaceuticals either from its primary wholesaler  amerisourcebergen corp  which accounted for approximately of both the company s overall and drug purchases  respectively  or directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
most of the purchases from the company s primary wholesaler were for brand name medicines 
the company believes that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand name pharmaceuticals are readily available  except to the extent that brand name drugs are available to the market exclusively through the manufacturer 
the company derives a substantial percentage of its specialty pharmacy segment revenue and profitability from its relationships with a limited number of suppliers 
specialty and generic pharmaceuticals are generally purchased directly from manufacturers 
inventories  net 
inventories  net  are located in the company s mail order pharmacies and in warehouses  consist solely of finished product primarily prescription drugs  and are valued at the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
property and equipment  net 
property and equipment  net  is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method for assets with useful lives as follows buildings  years  machinery  equipment and office furnishings  three to years  and computer software  three to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over three to five years 
costs for general and administrative expenses  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to existing systems  are expensed as incurred 
net revenues 
product net revenues consist principally of sales of prescription drugs to clients and members  either through the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or through the company s mail order pharmacies 
the majority of the company s product net revenues are derived on a fee for service basis 
the company s product net revenues also include revenues from the sale of diabetes supplies by polymedica 
specialty pharmacy product net revenues represent revenues from the sale of primarily biopharmaceutical drugs and are reported at the net amount billed to third party payors and patients 
the company recognizes product revenues when the prescriptions are dispensed through retail pharmacies in the company s networks of contractually affiliated retail pharmacies or the company s mail order pharmacies and received by members and patients 
the company evaluates client contracts using the indicators of authoritative guidance to determine whether the company acts as a principal or as an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through the retail pharmacy network 
the company acts as a principal in most of its transactions with clients and revenues are recognized at the prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee negotiated with clients  including the portion of the price allocated by the client to be settled directly by the member co payment  as well as the company s administrative fees gross reporting 
gross reporting is appropriate because the company a has separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  b is responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through its claims adjudication process  c commits to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  including instructing the pharmacy as to how that price is to be settled co payment requirements  d manages the overall prescription drug relationship with the patients  who are members of clients plans  and e has credit risk for the price due from the client 
in limited instances where the company adjudicates prescriptions at pharmacies that are under contract directly with the client and there are no financial risks to the company  such revenue is recorded at the amount of the administrative fee earned by the company for processing the claim net reporting 

table of contents the company s product net revenues also include premiums associated with the company s medicare pdp risk based product offerings 
these products involve prescription dispensing for beneficiaries enrolled in the cms sponsored medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
the company s two insurance company subsidiaries have been operating under contracts with cms since  and currently offer several medicare pdp options 
the products involve underwriting the benefit  charging enrollees applicable premiums  providing covered prescription drugs and administering the benefit as filed with cms 
the company provides three medicare drug benefit plan options for beneficiaries  including i a standard part d benefit plan as mandated by statute  and ii two benefit plans with enhanced coverage  that exceed the standard part d benefit plan  available for an additional premium 
the company also offers numerous customized benefit plan designs to employer group retiree plans under the medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
the pdp premiums are determined based on the company s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with cms 
the pdp premiums are primarily comprised of amounts received from cms as part of a direct subsidy and an additional subsidy from cms for low income member premiums  as well as premium payments received from members 
these premiums are recognized ratably to product net revenues over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits 
premiums received in advance of the applicable benefit period are deferred and recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
there is a possibility that the annual costs of drugs may be higher or lower than premium revenues 
as a result  cms provides a risk corridor adjustment for the standard drug benefit that compares the company s actual annual drug costs incurred to the targeted premiums in the company s cms approved bid 
based on specific collars in the risk corridor  the company will receive from cms additional premium amounts or be required to refund to cms previously received premium amounts 
the company calculates the risk corridor adjustment on a quarterly basis based on drug cost experience to date and records an adjustment to product net revenues with a corresponding account receivable from or payable to cms reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to premiums  there are certain co payments and deductibles the cost share due by members based on prescription orders by those members  some of which are subsidized by cms in cases of low income membership 
for subsidies received in advance  the amount is deferred and recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
if there is cost share due from members or cms  the amount is accrued and recorded in client accounts receivable  net  on the consolidated balance sheets 
after the end of the contract year and based on actual annual drug costs incurred  cost share amounts are reconciled with cms and the corresponding receivable or payable is settled 
the cost share is treated consistently as other co payments derived from providing pbm services  as a component of product net revenues on the consolidated statements of income where the requirements of authoritative guidance are met 
premium revenues for our pdp products  which exclude member cost share  were million  or less than of total net revenues  in  million  or less than of total net revenues  in  and million  or less than of total net revenues  in the company s agreements with cms  as well as applicable medicare part d regulations and federal and state laws  require the company to  among other obligations i comply with certain disclosure  filing  record keeping and marketing rules  ii operate quality assurance  drug utilization management and medication therapy management programs  iii support e prescribing initiatives  iv implement grievance  appeals and formulary exception processes  v comply with payment protocols  which include the return of overpayments to cms and  in certain circumstances  coordination with state pharmacy assistance programs  vi use approved networks and formularies  and provide access to such networks to any willing pharmacy  vii provide emergency out of network coverage  and viii adopt a comprehensive medicare and fraud  waste and abuse compliance program 
the company has various contractual and regulatory compliance requirements associated with participating in medicare part d 
similar to the company s requirements with other clients  the company s policies and practices associated with executing its pdp are subject to audit 
if material contractual or regulatory non compliance was to be identified  monetary penalties and or applicable sanctions  including suspension of enrollment and marketing or debarment from participation in medicare programs  may be imposed 
additionally  each calendar year  payment will vary based on the annual benchmark that applies as a result of medicare part d plan bids for the applicable year  as well as for changes in the cms methodology for calculating risk adjustment factors 

table of contents rebates and guarantees regarding the level of service the company will provide to the client or member or the minimum level of rebates or discounts the client will receive are deducted from product net revenues as they are earned by the client 
rebates are generally credited or paid to clients subsequent to collections from pharmaceutical manufacturers  although there are certain instances where rebates are paid to clients on a more accelerated basis 
other contractual payments made to clients are generally made upon initiation of contracts as implementation allowances  which may  for example  be designated by clients as funding for their costs to transition their plans to the company 
the company considers these payments to be an integral part of the company s pricing of a contract and believes that they represent variability in the timing of cash flows that does not change the underlying economics of the contract 
accordingly  these payments are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of product net revenues  generally on a straight line basis  over the life of the contract where the payments are refundable upon cancellation of the contract or relate to noncancelable contracts 
amounts capitalized are assessed periodically for recoverability based on the profitability of the contract 
service revenues consist principally of administrative fees and clinical program fees earned from clients  sales of prescription services to pharmaceutical manufacturers  performance oriented fees paid by specialty pharmacy manufacturers  and other non product related revenues 
service revenues are recorded by the company when performance occurs and collectibility is assured 
cost of revenues 
cost of product net revenues includes the cost of inventory dispensed from the mail order pharmacies  along with direct dispensing costs and associated depreciation 
cost of product net revenues also includes ingredient costs of drugs dispensed by and professional fees paid to retail network pharmacies 
in addition  cost of product net revenues includes the operating costs of the company s call center pharmacies  which primarily respond to member and retail pharmacist inquiries regarding member prescriptions  as well as physician calls 
cost of product net revenues also includes an offsetting credit for rebates earned from pharmaceutical manufacturers whose drugs are included on the company s preferred drug lists  which are also known as formularies 
rebates receivable from pharmaceutical manufacturers are accrued in the period earned by multiplying estimated rebatable prescription drugs dispensed through the company s retail networks and through the company s mail order pharmacies by the contractually agreed manufacturer rebate amount 
rebates receivable estimates are revised to actual  with the difference recorded to cost of revenues  upon billing to the manufacturer  generally to days subsequent to the end of the applicable quarter 
these bills are not issued until the necessary specific eligible claims and third party market share data are received and thoroughly analyzed 
historically  the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized and recorded to actual amounts billed has not been material to the company s results of operations 
the company s cost of product net revenues also includes the cost of drugs dispensed by the company s mail order pharmacies or retail networks for members covered under the company s medicare pdp product offerings and are recorded at cost as incurred 
the company receives a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy from cms for approximately of costs incurred by individual members in excess of the individual annual out of pocket maximum of  for coverage year   for coverage year and  for coverage year the subsidy is reflected as an offsetting credit in cost of product net revenues to the extent that catastrophic costs are incurred 
catastrophic reinsurance subsidy amounts received in advance are deferred and recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
if there are catastrophic reinsurance subsidies due from cms  the amount is recorded in client accounts receivable  net  on the consolidated balance sheets 
after the end of the contract year and based on actual annual drug costs incurred  catastrophic reinsurance amounts are reconciled with cms and the corresponding receivable or payable is settled

goodwill of  million at december  and  million at december  represents  for the pbm segment  the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the company s net assets that had been pushed down to the consolidated balance sheets of the company and existed when the company became an independent  publicly traded enterprise in  and  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisition of a majority interest in europa apotheek in  and the acquisitions of polymedica in and provantage health services  inc in goodwill also includes  for the specialty pharmacy segment  a portion of the excess of the purchase price the company paid to acquire accredo health  incorporated accredo over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired  as well as  to a significantly lesser extent  the company s acquisition of critical care systems  inc critical care in  and the acquisition of selected assets of pediatric services of america  inc in see note  acquisitions of businesses  for more information on the acquisition of a majority interest in europa apotheek  and the polymedica and critical care acquisitions 
the company s goodwill balance is assessed for impairment annually using a two step fair value based test or whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable  by comparing the fair value of each segment s reporting units to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities assigned to each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed the company s estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit  the company would then be required to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit for purposes of calculating the fair value of goodwill 
the company would be required to record an impairment charge to the extent recorded goodwill exceeds the fair value amount of goodwill resulting from this allocation 
the most recent assessment for impairment of goodwill for each of the designated reporting units was performed as of september   and the goodwill was determined not to be impaired  and there have been no significant subsequent changes in events or circumstances 
the company utilized the income approach methodology  which projects future cash flows discounted to present value 
discount rates were based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital at the reporting unit level and ranged from to 
in order to validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values  the company performed a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of all reporting units to market capitalization as of the valuation date using a reasonable control premium 
intangible assets  net 
intangible assets  net  of  million at december  and  million at december  for the pbm segment primarily represent the value of medco s client relationships that had been pushed down to the consolidated balance sheets of the company and existed when the company became an independent  publicly traded enterprise in  and to a lesser extent  intangible assets recorded upon the company s acquisition of polymedica in and a majority stake in europa apotheek in additionally  for the specialty pharmacy segment  intangible assets primarily include the portion of the excess of the purchase price paid by the company to acquire accredo in over tangible net assets acquired 
the company s intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently carried at amortized cost 
the company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events  such as losses of significant clients or specialty product manufacturer contracts  or when other changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when these events occur  the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the pre tax undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset grouping 
if this comparison indicates impairment exists  the amount of the impairment would be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
the liberty trade name intangible asset was assigned an indefinite life at the time of our acquisition of polymedica in subsequently in  management determined that the liberty trade name intangible asset was no longer indefinite lived and assigned a year useful life 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
on december   the first day of the company s fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of a new fasb standard  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in companies financial statements 
the standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with the standard is a two step process 
the first step is recognition to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the second step is measurement whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the standard also provides guidance on derecognition of recognized tax benefits  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the implementation of the fasb s uncertainty in income taxes standard  the company recognized a decrease of million in the liability for income tax contingencies  including interest  no longer required under the more likely than not accounting model  and a million corresponding increase  net of federal income tax benefit  to the december  the first day of fiscal year balance of retained earnings 
in may  the fasb issued additional guidance on how a company should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits

table of contents use of estimates 
the consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments

earnings per share eps 
basic eps is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during the reporting period 
the company treats stock options and restricted stock units granted by the company as potential common shares outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share 
under the treasury stock method on a grant by grant basis  the amount the employee or director must pay for exercising the award  the amount of compensation cost for future service that the company has not yet recognized  and the amount of tax benefit that would be recorded in additional paid in capital when the award becomes deductible  are assumed to be used to repurchase shares at the average market price during the period 
the company granted options of million shares in fiscal  million shares in fiscal  and million shares in fiscal for the years ended december   december  and december   there were outstanding options to purchase million  million and million shares of medco stock  respectively  which were not dilutive to the eps calculations when applying the treasury stock method 
these outstanding options may be dilutive to future eps calculations 
the following is a reconciliation of the number of weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted eps calculations amounts in millions fiscal years basic weighted average shares outstanding dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock diluted weighted average shares outstanding the decreases in the weighted average share outstanding and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for each year result from the repurchase of approximately million shares of stock in connection with the company s share repurchase programs since inception in through the end of  compared to equivalent amounts of million and million shares repurchased inception to date through the ends of and  respectively

actuarial assumptions 
actuarial weighted average assumptions used in determining plan information are as follows pension benefits other postretirement benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at fiscal year end discount rate salary growth rate weighted average assumptions used to determine net cost for the fiscal year ended discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets salary growth rate 
table of contents the expected rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on the plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
the expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return by the fair value of the plan assets and contributions  offset by expected return on expected benefit payments 
in developing the expected rate of return  the company considers long term compounded annualized returns of historical market data  as well as historical actual returns on our plan assets 
using this reference information  the company develops forward looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected long term rate of return for a targeted portfolio allocated across these investment categories 
future costs of the amended postretirement benefit healthcare plan are being capped based on costs 
as a result  employer liability is not affected by healthcare cost trend 
pension plan assets 
the company believes the oversight of the investments held under its pension plans is rigorous and the investment strategies are prudent 
the investment objectives of the company s qualified pension plan are designed to generate total asset returns both sufficient to meet its expected future benefit obligations  as well as returns greater than its policy benchmark reflecting the target weights of the asset classes used in its strategic asset allocation investment policy

the currently adopted strategic asset allocation targets approximately percent in equity securities and percent in fixed income and diversification within specific asset classes of these broad categories 
the company believes that the portfolio s equity weighting strategy is consistent with investment goals and risk management practices applicable to the long term nature of the plan s benefit obligation 
the precise amount for which the benefit obligations will be settled depends on future events  including interest rates  salary increases  and the life expectancy of the plan s members 
the obligations are estimated using actuarial assumptions  based on the current economic environment 
the following table sets forth the target allocation for by asset category and the plan assets at fair value at the year end reporting date by level within the fair value hierarchy in millions percent of target plan assets allocation at year end asset category total level level level us equity securities us large cap us small mid cap international equity securities fixed income total see note  fair value disclosures  for a description of the fair value hierarchy

such coverage reflects market conditions including cost and availability existing at the time coverage is written 
in addition to the company s commercial professional liability insurance policies  the company has a retained liability component requiring certain self insurance reserves to cover potential claims 
the company currently processes any claims included in self insured retention levels through a captive insurance company 
the company s pbm operations  including  for example  the dispensing of prescription drugs by its mail order pharmacies  may subject the company to litigation and liability for damages 
historically  the company has not had any professional liability claims that have exceeded its insurance coverage amount  and any claims have not been material 
the company believes that its insurance coverage protection for these types of claims is adequate 
however  the company might not be able to maintain its professional and general liability insurance coverage in the future  and insurance coverage might not be available on acceptable terms or adequate to cover any or all potential professional liability claims 
a successful professional liability claim in excess of the company s insurance coverage  or one for which an exclusion from coverage applies  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations

rule b sales plans 
medco s comprehensive compliance program includes a broad policy against insider trading 
the procedures promulgated under that policy include regularly scheduled blackout periods that apply to over employees 
executive officers are prohibited from trading in company stock during the period that begins on the first day of the last month of the fiscal period and ends on the third trading day after the release of earnings 
in addition  executive officers are required to pre clear all of their trades 
medco s executive officers are also subject to share ownership guidelines and retention requirements 
the ownership targets are based on a multiple of salary  or times salary  but are expressed as a number of shares 
the targets are determined using base salary and the closing price of our stock on the date of our annual meeting of shareholders 
the number of shares required to be held has been calculated using a stock price  the closing price of our stock on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders 
to facilitate compliance with the ownership guidelines and retention requirements  medco s board of directors authorized the use of prearranged trading plans under rule b of the securities exchange act of rule b permits insiders to adopt predetermined plans for selling specified amounts of stock or exercising stock options under specified conditions and at specified times 
executive officers may only enter into a trading plan during an open trading window and they must not possess material nonpublic information regarding the company at the time they adopt the plan 
using trading plans  insiders can diversify their investment portfolios while avoiding concerns about transactions occurring at a time when they might possess material nonpublic information 
under medco s policy  sales instructions made pursuant to a written trading plan may be executed during a blackout period 
in addition  the use of trading plans provides medco with a greater ability to monitor trading and compliance with its stock ownership guidelines 
generally  under these trading plans  the individual relinquishes control over the transactions once the trading plan is put into place 
accordingly  sales under these plans may occur at any time  including possibly before  simultaneously with  or immediately after significant events involving our company 

table of contents all trading plans adopted by medco executives are reviewed and approved by the office of the general counsel 
for ease of administration  executives have been permitted to add new orders to existing plans rather than requiring the adoption of a new plan 
once modified  a plan cannot be changed for at least days 
both new plans and modifications are subject to a mandatory waiting period designed to safeguard the plans from manipulation or market timing
