for additional segment level information related to restructuring activities  you should refer to the information set forth under the caption  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this report  as well as in part ii  item under note  restructuring to the consolidated financial statements 
competitive conditions our lines of business are conducted under highly competitive conditions in each of the geographic and product areas they serve 
because of the diversity of the classes of products manufactured and sold  they do not compete with the same companies in all geographic or product areas 
accordingly  it is not possible to estimate the precise number of competitors or to identify our competitive position  although we believe that we are a principal competitor in most of our markets 
our principal method of competition is production of quality products at competitive prices in a timely and efficient manner 
our products have primary application in the aerospace  defense electronics  rv  transportation  automated merchandising  chemical  pharmaceutical  oil  gas  power  nuclear  building services and utilities 
as such  our revenues are dependent upon numerous unpredictable factors  including changes in market demand  general economic conditions and capital spending 
because these products are also sold in a wide variety of markets and applications  we do not believe we can reliably quantify or predict the possible effects upon our business resulting from such changes 
our engineering and product development activities are directed primarily toward improvement of existing products and adaptation of existing products to particular customer requirements as well as the development of new products 
while we own numerous patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property  none are of such importance that termination would materially affect our business 
from time to time  however  we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property 
research and development research and development costs are expensed when incurred 
these costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and were incurred primarily by the aerospace electronics segment 
funds received from customer sponsored research and development projects were million  million and million in  and respectively  and were recorded in net sales 
our customers no customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in  or raw materials our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials  including steel  copper  cast iron  electronic components  aluminum  plastics and various petroleum based products 
we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world 
although market forces have generally caused increases in the costs of steel and petroleum based products  there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business  and we believe that we will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at reasonable costs 
seasonal nature of business our business does not experience significant seasonality 
government contracts we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities  primarily involving products in our aerospace electronics business segment and our fluid handling business segment 
as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws and regulations governing government contracts differ from those governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts require disclosure of cost and pricing data and impose certain sourcing conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
our failure to comply with these laws could result in suspension of these contracts  criminal or civil sanctions  administrative penalties and fines or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
for example  as previously disclosed  we sold certain valves made by our fluid handling segment to private customers that ultimately were delivered to us military agencies which did not conform to certain contractual specifications relating to the place of manufacture and the origin of component parts 
subsequent to a us government investigation  in july  we executed a settlement 
table of contents part i item agreement with the department of justice providing for  among other things  the payment of million to the united states

see part i  item legal proceedings regarding certain costs of compliance with federal  state and local laws and regulations involving the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
financing in september  we entered into a five year  million amended and restated credit agreement the facility  which is due to expire on september  this facility amends and restates the five year million revolving credit agreement entered into on january   which included a million term loan component that was terminated by the company in may the facility allows us to borrow  repay  or to the extent permitted by the agreement  prepay and re borrow at any time prior to the stated maturity date  and the loan proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes including financing for acquisitions 
the original facility was amended and restated to capitalize on favorable bank market conditions and to extend the maturity of the facility

the facility was only used for letter of credit purposes in  and was not used in or the facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type  including the absence of a material adverse effect and limitations on us and our subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness  liens  mergers  consolidations  liquidations and dissolutions  sales of all or substantially all assets  transactions with affiliates and hedging arrangements 
the facility also provides for customary events of default  including failure to pay principal  interest or fees when due  failure to comply with covenants  the fact that any representation or warranty made by us is false in any material respect  default under certain other indebtedness  certain insolvency or receivership events affecting us and our subsidiaries  certain erisa events  material judgments and a change in control

risk factors 
the following is a description of what we consider the key challenges and risks confronting our business 
this discussion should be considered in conjunction with the discussion under the caption forward looking information preceding part i  the information set forth under item  business and with the discussion of the business included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these risks comprise the material risks of which we are aware 
if any of the events or developments described below or elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or in any documents that we subsequently file publicly were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our business we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury  and costs associated with these lawsuits may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and financial position 
we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury 
estimation of our ultimate exposure for asbestos related claims is subject to significant uncertainties  as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing  severity and quantity of claims 
our estimate of the future expense of these claims is derived from assumptions with respect to future claims  settlement and defense costs which are based on experience during the last few years and which may not prove reliable as predictors 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  depending on the nature of the alleged injury  the jurisdiction where filed and the quality of the product identification  or a significant upward or downward trend in the costs of defending claims  could change the estimated liability  as would substantial adverse verdicts at trial or on appeal 
a legislative solution or a structured settlement transaction could also change the estimated liability 
these uncertainties may result in our incurring future charges or increases to income to adjust the carrying value of recorded liabilities and assets  particularly if the number of claims and settlements and defense costs escalates or if legislation or another alternative solution is implemented  however  we are currently unable to predict such future events 
the resolution of these claims may take many years  and the effect on results of operations  cash flow and financial position in any given period from a revision to these estimates could be material 
as of december   we were one of a number of defendants in cases involving approximately  pending claims filed in various state and federal courts that allege injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pending claims  our historical settlement and defense costs for asbestos claims  the liability we have recorded in our financial statements for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  the asset we have recorded in our financial statements related to our estimated insurance coverage for asbestos claims  and uncertainties related to our net asbestos liability 
we have recorded a liability for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  and while it is probable that we will incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after  which additional liabilities may be significant  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time 
in the third quarter  we updated and extended the estimate of our asbestos liability and recorded an additional pre tax provision of approximately million  which includes a corresponding insurance receivable 
current economic conditions may harm our business  results of operations and stock price 
beginning in the second half of  the us and global economies slowed dramatically as a result of a variety of problems  including turmoil in the credit and financial markets  concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions  the state of the housing markets and volatility in fuel prices and worldwide stock markets 
given the significance and widespread nature of these nearly unprecedented circumstances  the us and global economies could remain significantly challenged in a recessionary state for an indeterminate period of time 
while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in the global industrial markets that we serve 
continued restrictions on credit availability could adversely affects the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and could result in further decreases in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments 
similarly  continued credit restrictions may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy 
these conditions would harm our business by adversely affecting our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
see specific risks relating to our business segments  below 
as of december   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the aforementioned disruptions in the credit markets and concerns about global economic growth have continued to impact our operating results in as of december   there was no impairment of these assets 
however  declines in our stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow estimates within specific businesses  and slower growth rates in our target markets are all factors that may indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets may not be recoverable and  accordingly  could result in material noncash impairment charges at some point in the future 
our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities  costs  litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and reputation 
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate  which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground  air and water and establish standards for the generation  treatment  use  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 
failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties and damage to our reputation 
in addition  
table of contents part i item a we cannot provide assurance that our costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
for example  during and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  related to increases in our expected liability at our goodyear  arizona superfund site pursuant to continuing changes in site conditions 
our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation  failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and reputation 
primarily in our aerospace electronics and fluid handling segments  we are required to comply with various import and export control laws  which may affect our transactions with certain customers 
in certain circumstances  export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products  services and technologies  and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item 
we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts  including requirements related to procurement integrity  export control  employment practices  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
a failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
in addition  failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  fines  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability to export products and services  and damage to our reputation 
for example  in the third quarter  we recorded a million charge related to a civil false claims proceeding by the us government 
see the civil false claims settlement section under item pension expense and pension contributions associated with the company s retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantly depending upon changes in actuarial assumptions and future market performance of plan assets 
a significant portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by pension and post retirement benefit plans  the costs of which are dependent upon various assumptions  including estimates of rates of return on benefit related assets  discount rates for future payment obligations  rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs 
in addition  funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension and post retirement benefit plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions 
variances from these estimates could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flow 
in  we contributed million into our defined benefit pension plans compared to million in the increase in contributions primarily relates to higher contributions to our us defined benefit plan to comply with certain pension protection act provisions and resulted in part from declines in the market value of investments during of the million  million was contributed to our us defined benefit plan in december on a discretionary basis to improve the funded status of this plan and to reduce future expected contributions 
our expense was million higher than in demand for our products is variable and subject to factors beyond our control  which could result in unanticipated events significantly impacting our results of operations 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in industries that are cyclical in nature or subject to market conditions which may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile 
these industries often are subject to fluctuations in domestic and international economies as well as to currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures 
reductions in the business levels of these industries would reduce the sales and profitability of the affected business segments 
in our aerospace electronics segment  for example  a significant decline in demand for air travel  or a decline in airline profitability generally  could result in reduced orders for aircraft and could also cause airlines to reduce their purchases of repair parts from our businesses 
our aerospace businesses could also be impacted to the extent that major aircraft manufacturers encountered production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
in our engineered materials segment  sales and profits have been affected by declines in demand for truck trailers  rvs  or building products 
in our fluid handling segment  further slowing of the economy or major markets could reduce sales and profits  particularly if projects for which these businesses are suppliers or bidders are cancelled or delayed 
results in our controls segment could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the oil and gas or heavy truck markets  or from unforeseen product obsolescence 
results at our merchandising systems business have been and will continue to be affected by employment levels  office occupancy rates and factors affecting vending operator profitability such as fuel  confection and borrowing costs 
we may be unable to improve productivity  reduce costs and align manufacturing capacity with customer demand 
we are committed to continuous productivity improvement and continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs  simplify or improve global processes  and increase the reliability of order fulfillment and satisfaction of customer needs 
during the fourth quarter of  in response to disruptions in the credit markets and a substantially weakened global economy  we initiated broad based restructuring actions in order to align our cost base to then expected lower levels of demand 
at that time  we anticipated a core revenue decline for during  our sales declined further than we anticipated  with core revenues declining by  or million from in response  we continuously accelerated our cost savings initiatives and reduced our cost base by approximately million  well ahead of our goal 
while we exceeded our savings objective  and considering in particular the current uncertainty in the us and global economies  our failure to continue to anticipate further declines in global demand for our products and services and properly align our cost base would have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 

table of contents part i item a we may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products  which would limit our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our growth depends  in part  on continued sales of existing products  as well as the successful development and introduction of new products  which face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors 
any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market  which could compromise our competitive position 
further  the development and introduction of new products may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital equipment  increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses 
we also may need to modify our systems and strategy in light of new products that we develop 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations related to new products  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
the prices of our raw materials can fluctuate dramatically  which may adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of certain raw materials that are critical to our profitability are volatile 
this volatility can have a significant impact on our profitability 
in our engineered materials segment  for example  profits could be adversely affected by unanticipated increases in resin and fiberglass material costs and by the inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their position in product cost and functionality against competing materials 
the costs in our fluid handling and merchandising systems segments similarly are affected by fluctuations in the price of metals such as steel 
while we have taken actions aimed at securing an adequate supply of raw materials at prices which are favorable to us  if the prices of critical raw materials increase  our operating costs could be negatively affected 
our ability to obtain parts and raw materials from our suppliers is uncertain  and any disruptions or delays in our supply chain could negatively affect our results of operations 
our operations require significant amounts of important parts and raw materials 
we are engaged in a continuous  company wide effort to concentrate our purchases of parts and raw materials on fewer suppliers  and to obtain parts from suppliers in low cost countries where possible 
as this effort progresses  we are exposed to an increased risk of disruptions to our supply chain  which could have a significant effect on our operating results 
in addition  if we are unable to procure these parts or raw materials  our operations may be disrupted  or we could experience a delay or halt in certain of our manufacturing operations 
we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risk and the costs of alternative practices 
nonetheless  supplier capacity constraints  supplier production disruptions  supplier financial condition  price volatility or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions  or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of potential acquisition transactions 
our acquisition program attempts to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities  systems of internal control and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire 
integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties  including maintenance of uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  distraction of management s attention from normal business operations during the integration process  expenses associated with the integration efforts  and unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process  including legal contingencies 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future  that we will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable  which could adversely impact our growth rate 
our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings 
we face significant competition which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position in the future 
while we are a principal competitor in most of our markets  all of our markets are highly competitive 
the competitors in many of our business segments can be expected in the future to improve technologies  reduce costs and develop and introduce new products  and the ability of our business segments to achieve similar advances will be important to our competitive positions 
competitive pressures  including those discussed above  could cause one or more of our business segments to lose market share or could result in significant price erosion  either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states and face risks inherent in non domestic operations 
net sales and assets related to our operations outside the united states were and in  and and in  respectively  of our consolidated amounts 
these operations and transactions are subject to the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including the risks of currency fluctuations  slower payment of invoices  adverse trade regulations and possible social  economic and political instability in the countries and regions in which we operate 
we are dependent on key personnel  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain additional personnel needed for us to sustain and grow our business as planned 
certain of our business segments and corporate offices are dependent upon highly qualified personnel  and we generally are dependent upon the continued efforts of key management employees 
we may have difficulty retaining such personnel or locating and hiring additional qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  many of whom are not party to employment agreements with us  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified 
table of contents part i item a and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to successfully sustain and grow our business  which could impact our results of operations in a materially adverse manner 
if our internal controls are found to be ineffective  our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 
we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods  however  increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized 
in addition  if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective  investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which may adversely affect our stock price 
specific risks relating to our business segments the macroeconomic climate represents one of the most significant risks for and could cause our customers across our business segments to delay  forego or reduce the amount of their investments in our products or delay payments of amounts due to us 
in addition  declines in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  the british pound or the canadian dollar  could adversely affect our reported results  primarily in our fluid handling and merchandising systems segments  as amounts earned in other countries are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
aerospace electronics a difficult us economic environment continued to negatively impact the airline industry during companies tightened corporate travel policies  resulting in a decline in business travel and a decrease in the percentage of full fare purchases 
fuel prices also continued to impact the industry 
although fuel prices were lower overall than in  prices remained much higher than long term historical averages 
these factors adversely impact the commercial aerospace industry as some larger domestic airline carriers have reduced service and capacity  including retiring their older and less fuel efficient aircraft  and cutting payroll costs  while several smaller carriers have either declared bankruptcy or ceased operations 
in addition  these conditions have  in particular  depressed manufacturing activity specific to business and regional jets 
lower levels of air travel or a decline in airline profitability generally results in reduced aircraft orders and could also cause the airlines to scale back on more of their purchases of our commercial products  which represents a significant portion of the aerospace electronics segment revenues 
our businesses could also be impacted to the extent that major aircraft manufacturers encounter production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers causes the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
our sales and profits could also face erosion if pricing pressure from competitors increased  if finding new aerospace qualified suppliers became more difficult  if required technical personnel became harder to hire and retain  if planned new aircraft programs were delayed while we incur engineering development expenses for related products  or if we are unable to effectively reduce our cost base in response to additional  unanticipated declines in demand for our products and services 
a portion of this segment s business is conducted under us government contracts and subcontracts 
these contracts are either competitively bid or sole source contracts 
competitively bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among suppliers 
sole source contracts are awarded when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology that is superior to that of competing contractors 
a reduction in congressional appropriations that affect defense spending or the ability of the us government to terminate our contracts could impact the performance of this business 
in addition  we are required to comply with various export control laws  which may affect our transactions with certain customers 
in certain circumstances  export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products  services and technologies  and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item 
a failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  fines  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability to export products and services  and damage to our reputation 
engineered materials in our engineered materials segment  sales and profits could continue to fall if there are further declines in demand for truck trailers  rvs and building products for which our businesses produce fiberglass reinforced panels 
we experienced declines in sales to rv manufacturers through as the rv industry continued to curtail production in response to a fall off in demand from their customers 
the industry attributes this downturn to continued restrictions on credit availability  generally weak consumer confidence and  to a lesser extent  higher gas prices and inventory reductions on dealer lots 
while rv orders improved somewhat in late  future demand remains uncertain 
similar to the rv market  we experienced declines in building products sales through  driven largely by the depressed us non residential construction market and the industry expects further declines in in addition  profits could also be adversely affected by unanticipated increases in resin and fiberglass material costs  by the loss of a principal supplier or by any inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their product cost and functionality advantages when compared to competing materials 
the company is also defending a series of five separate lawsuits  which have now been consolidated  revolving around a fire that occurred in may at a chicken processing plant located near atlanta  georgia that destroyed the plant 
the aggregate damages demanded by the plaintiff  consisting largely of an estimate of lost profits which continues to grow with the passage of time  are currently in excess of million 
these lawsuits contend that certain fiberglass reinforced plastic material manufactured by the company that was installed inside the plant was unsafe in that it acted as an accelerant  causing the fire to spread rapidly  resulting in the total loss of the plant and property 
in september  the trial court entertained motions for summary judgment from all parties  and subsequently denied those motions 
in november  the company sought and was granted permission to appeal the trial court s denial of its motions 
the company expects the appeal process to conclude in six to nine months 
the trial will be stayed pending resolution of the appeal 
the company believes that it has valid defenses to the underlying claims raised in these lawsuits 
the company has given notice of these lawsuits to its 
table of contents part i item a insurance carriers and will seek coverage for any resulting losses 
the company s carriers have issued standard reservation of rights letters but are engaged with the company s trial counsel to monitor the defense of these claims 
if the plaintiffs in these lawsuits were to prevail at trial and be awarded the full extent of their claimed damages  and insurance coverage were not fully available  the resulting liability could have a significant effect on the company s results of operations and cash flow in the periods affected 
merchandising systems results at our merchandising systems businesses could be reduced by continued unfavorable economic conditions  including lower demand for our products and services  inflation and continued increases in fuel costs 
in addition  delays in launching or supplying new products or an inability to achieve new product sales objectives  or unfavorable changes in gaming regulations affecting certain of our payment solutions customers would adversely affect our profitability  as would failure to reduce our cost base in response to further  unanticipated declines in demand for our products 
furthermore  any unanticipated operational inefficiencies resulting from consolidation activities would also adversely affect our profitability 
results at our foreign locations have been and will continue to be affected by fluctuations in the value of the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
fluid handling our fluid handling businesses could face increased price competition from larger competitors 
further slowing of the economy or major markets could reduce sales and profits  particularly if projects for which these businesses are suppliers or bidders are cancelled or delayed 
during  we experienced slowing orders from short cycle north american businesses as well as continued delays of several large valve projects into continued weakness in short cycle north american businesses and or further delays in large valve projects may put further pressure on operating margins in the fluid handling segment 
to the extent we are unable to effectively reduce our cost base in response to further  unanticipated declines in demand for our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
at our foreign operations  reported results in us dollar terms could be eroded by a weakening of currency of the respective businesses  particularly where we operate using the euro  british pound and canadian dollar 
controls a number of factors could affect operating results in our controls segment 
lower sales and earnings could result if our businesses cannot maintain their cost competitiveness  encounter delays in introducing new products or fail to achieve their new product sales objectives 
results could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the industrial machinery  oil and gas or heavy equipment industries  or from unforeseen product obsolescence 
a portion of this segment s business is subject to government rules and regulations 
failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting 
failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal  monetary and non monetary penalties  disruptions to our business  limitations on our ability to export products and services  and damage to our reputation

table of contents part ii item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products 
our business consists of five segments aerospace electronics  engineered materials  merchandising systems  fluid handling and controls 
our primary markets are aerospace  defense electronics  recreational vehicle rv  transportation  automated merchandising  chemical  pharmaceutical  oil gas  power  nuclear  building services and utilities 
our strategy is to grow the earnings of niche businesses with leading market shares  acquire companies that fit strategically with existing businesses  aggressively pursue operational and strategic linkages among our businesses  build a performance culture focused on continuous improvement and a committed management team whose interests are directly aligned with those of the shareholders and maintain a focused  efficient corporate structure 
in response to disruptions in the credit markets and a substantially weakening global economy  in the fourth quarter of  we initiated broad based restructuring actions in order to align our cost base to expected lower levels of demand 
our core sales declined by from  which compared to our expectation of at the beginning of the year and  in response  we continually accelerated our productivity programs across all areas of the business to ensure our cost base was sized appropriately 
by the end of  we reduced targeted costs by million compared to  which exceeded our goal for the year 
this full year level of savings equates to approximately of our sales  which we view as a significant accomplishment and a reflection of our cost sensitive culture 
items affecting comparability of reported results the comparability of our operating results for the years ended december   and is affected by the following significant items ge aviation systems llc and the boeing company settlement during the fourth quarter of  we executed agreements with ge aviation systems llc and the boeing company resolving our claims relating to the brake control monitoring system being developed by our aerospace group for the boeing the settlement claim 
as a result of the agreement  our aerospace group recognized an increase in sales of million and an after tax benefit of per share in fiberglass reinforced plastics lawsuit on april   we reached an agreement to settle a lawsuit brought by a customer alleging failure of the company s fiberglass reinforced plastic material in rv sidewalls manufactured by such customers 
in mediation  we agreed to a settlement aggregating million payable in several installments through july   all of which have been paid 
based upon both insurer commitments and liability estimates previously recorded in  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with this settlement in restructuring and related costs during the fourth quarter of  we initiated broad based restructuring actions to align our cost base to then current market conditions which included facility consolidations  headcount reductions and other related costs  the restructuring program 
at december   we recorded pre tax restructuring and related charges in the business segments totaling million 
the charges include workforce reduction expenses and facility exit costs of million and million related to asset write downs 
in  we substantially completed our restructuring actions and recorded pre tax restructuring and related charges in the business segments totaling million 
the charges include workforce reduction expenses and facility exit costs of million and million related to asset write downs 
during the fourth quarter of  our fluid handling segment commenced implementation of a restructuring program designed to further enhance operating margins through ceasing the manufacture of malleable iron and bronze fittings at foundry operating facilities in the uk and canada  respectively  and exiting both facilities and transferring production to china 
the program primarily included workforce reduction expenses and facility exit costs  all of which are expected to be cash costs 
in december  we recognized workforce reduction charges of million and  also in december  pursuant to this program  we sold our foundry facility in the uk  generating a pre tax gain of million 
the foundry restructuring was completed in environmental charges for environmental matters  the company records a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that the company will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated 
generally  third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs 
the environmental remediation liability at december  and is substantially all for the former manufacturing site in goodyear  arizona the goodyear site discussed below 
the goodyear site was operated by unidynamics phoenix  inc upi  which became an indirect subsidiary of the company in when the company acquired upi s parent company  unidynamics corporation 
upi manufactured explosive and pyrotechnic compounds  including components for critical military programs  for the us government at the goodyear site from to  under contracts with the department of defense and other government agencies and certain of their prime contractors 
no manufacturing operations have been conducted at the goodyear site since the goodyear site was placed on the national priorities list in  and is now part of the phoenix goodyear airport north superfund goodyear site 
in  the epa issued administrative orders requiring upi to design and carry out certain remedial actions  which upi has done 
groundwater extraction and treatment systems have been in operation at the goodyear site since a soil vapor extraction system was in operation from to  was restarted in  and is currently in operation 
on july   the company entered into a consent decree with the epa with respect to the goodyear site providing for  among other things  a work plan for further investigation and remediation activities at the goodyear site 
the company recorded a liability in for estimated costs through after reaching substantial agreement on the scope of work with the epa 
at the end of september  the liability totaled million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company and its technical advisors 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations determined that changing groundwater flow rates and contaminant plume direction at the goodyear site required additional extraction systems as well as modifications and upgrades of the existing systems 
in consultation with its technical advisors  the company prepared a forecast of the expenditures required for these new and upgraded systems as well as the costs of operation over the forecast period through taking these additional costs into consideration  the company estimated its liability for the costs of such activities through to be million which resulted in a charge of million during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  based on further consultation with our advisors and the epa and in response to groundwater monitoring results that reflected a continuing migration in contaminant plume direction during the year  the company revised its forecast of remedial activities to increase the level of extraction systems and the number of monitoring wells in and around the goodyear site  among other things 
as of december   the revised liability estimate was million which resulted in an additional charge of million during the fourth quarter of as of december   the liability estimate was million 
on july   the company entered into a consent decree with the us department of justice on behalf of the department of defense and the department of energy pursuant to which  among other things  the us government reimburses the company for percent of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the goodyear site 
as of december  the company has recorded a receivable of million for the expected reimbursements from the us government in respect of the aggregate liability as at that date 
in the first quarter of  the company issued a million letter of credit to support requirements of the consent decree for the goodyear site 
asbestos charge with the assistance of outside experts  during the third quarter of  we updated and extended our estimate of our asbestos liability  including the costs of settlement or indemnity payments and defense costs relating to currently pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through our previous estimate was for asbestos claims filed through as a result of this updated estimate  we recorded an additional pre tax provision of million during the third quarter of this amount includes a corresponding insurance receivable 
our decision to take this action was based on several factors at the time  including the number of asbestos claims being filed against us has moderated substantially over the past several years  and in our opinion  the outlook for asbestos claims expected to be filed and resolved in the forecast period should be reasonably stable  the stable outlook for future claims is particularly true for mesothelioma claims  which although constituting only of our asbestos claims account for approximately of our aggregate settlement and defense costs over the past five years  federal legislation that would significantly change the nature of asbestos litigation failed to pass in  and in our opinion  the prospects for such legislation at the federal level are remote  there have been significant actions taken by certain state legislatures and courts over the past several years that have reduced the number and types of claims that can proceed to trial  which has been a significant factor in stabilizing the asbestos claim activity  and we have entered into coverage in place agreements with a majority of our excess insurers  which enables us to project a more stable relationship between settlement and defense costs paid by us and reimbursements from our insurers 
taking all of these factors into account  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos liability for pending claims and future claims to be filed through while it is probable that we will incur additional charges for asbestos liabilities and defense costs in excess of the amounts currently provided  we do not believe that any such amount can be reasonably estimated beyond accordingly  no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be incurred for claims made subsequent to the liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
civil false claims settlement during  we recorded a million charge related to a civil false claims proceeding by the us government  arising out of allegations that certain valves sold by our crane valves north america unit cvna to private customers that ultimately were delivered to us military agencies did not conform to contractual specifications relating to the place of manufacture and the origin of component parts 
divestitures in december  we sold general technology corporation gtc generating proceeds of million and after tax gain of million 
gtc  also known as crane electronic manufacturing services  was included in our aerospace electronics segment  as part of the electronics group 
gtc had million in sales in and is located in albuquerque  new mexico 
in december  together with our partner  emerson electric co  we sold the industrial motion control  llc imc joint venture  generating proceeds of million and an after tax gain of million 
our investment in imc was million and we recorded income in and of million and million respectively 
repatriation of foreign earnings during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that our cash balances overseas were in excess of our projected future needs outside the united states 
as a result  we established a million deferred tax liability related to the estimated additional us federal and state income taxes due upon the ultimate repatriation of million of such cash balances

asbestos and environmental charges see discussion of the asbestos charge and the and environmental charges beginning on the first page of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook general concerns about global economic growth for industrial businesses and disruptions in the financial markets had a significant adverse impact on our end markets and  correspondingly  our results of operations and cash flow in we experienced a core sales decline during  which far exceeded our initial expectation of a decline 
notwithstanding  the corresponding deleverage on operating profit and impact on cash flow was substantially mitigated by our aggressive cost reduction programs 
as described above  we ended with approximately million in cost savings 
we have a culturally embedded  disciplined approach to ensuring our cost structure is properly aligned to demand and we have planned modest declines in headcount and manufacturing infrastructure during at the same time  we are continuing to make investments in additional front end resources and support new product development activities in order to grow our market share 
with respect to core growth  while we continue to see uncertainty in several of our target markets  for example  in the longer cycle energy  chemical and pharmaceutical and commercial aerospace markets  we also see signs of stabilization in some of our shorter cycle businesses 
in summary  we expect sales to be generally flat compared to we expect core sales in fluid handling and merchandising systems to be flat  and a sales decline in our aerospace group is expected to be offset by modest increases in sales in the electronics group  engineered materials and controls businesses 
segment level details with respect to our outlook for sales and operating profit are provided below 
aerospace electronics our aerospace electronics segment has experienced a significant increase in operating profit in when compared to last year 
this increase was driven by substantially lower engineering expense in the aerospace group as we completed key activities related to the development of new products for the boeing and airbus am programs  the favorable impact of the settlement claim  and in our electronics group  stable demand in the defense electronics business  strong program execution and aggressive cost reduction programs 
specific to our aerospace group  pursuant to the settlement agreement  our supply contract will now be direct to boeing  and we have resumed work  on a funded basis  on a modified version of the brake control monitoring system 
with this new arrangement  we expect continued declines in engineering expense in the aerospace group through partially offsetting the expected benefit of lower engineering expense  volumes and profits are expected to be unfavorably impacted by further softening of long cycle sales to commercial aerospace customers 
in summary  we expect a decline in aerospace group sales  driven by both the softening commercial aerospace market and the absence of the settlement claim  and a modest decline in operating profit driven by the impact of the lower sales and the absence of the settlement claim  partially offset by lower engineering expense 
in the electronics group  considering both the acquisition of merrimac industries  inc merrimac and the divestiture of gtc  sales are expected to be slightly higher and operating profit generally flat 
engineered materials our engineered materials business segment experienced a significant improvement in operating profit in when compared to last year  notwithstanding a higher than expected decline in sales 
the increase in operating profit primarily reflected the absence of a million restructuring charge recorded in  as well as the favorable impact of culturally embedded cost discipline and productivity savings 
the sales decline reflected substantially lower volumes to rv manufacturers  coupled with sharp declines in our building product and transportation customers 
while the rv and transportation end markets are showing signs of stabilization  we expect continued pressure in our building products business  as the us non residential construction industry is forecasted to decline further in considering all of the foregoing  which includes our expectation of targeted market share gains and new product introductions that we expect to largely offset potential further deterioration in our end markets in  coupled with our leaner organizational structure  we expect a modest increase in both sales and operating profit 

table of contents part ii item merchandising systems depressed conditions in end markets for our vending solutions and payment solutions businesses has put pressure on our operating margins within our merchandising systems segment 
specifically  we experienced a and decline in sales and operating profit  respectively this comparison includes a million decrease in restructuring charges compared to 
in response  we have taken aggressive steps to reduce costs across the business  including reducing headcount by during which follows a reduction in compared to and  within vending solutions  completing the consolidation of our two large north american plants 
notably  demand for higher margin payment solutions products declined substantially through the second half of the year as end market applications  including retail  transportation  and non us gaming  declined sharply 
however  while still at very depressed levels  we experienced a sequential quarterly increase in fourth quarter sales for our vending solutions products 
we anticipate stabilization in vending solutions product demand in  but continued market weakness for our payment solutions products 
with planned new product introduction and targeted market share gains  we expect sales in to be generally flat with we also expect operating profit to be generally flat  based largely upon a full year of savings related to consolidation activities and other productivity improvements  offset by lower sales of higher margin payment solutions products 
fluid handling our fluid handling segment experienced a million decline in operating profit  or compared to the operating profit decline was driven by deleverage associated with volume declines across substantially all businesses 
softness in the north american industrial market and general weakness in global refining and power markets resulted in project deferrals and lower mro sales 
continued weakness in the non residential construction market also contributed to lower levels of demand for certain of our products and services  globally 
the impact of the lower volumes was  in part  mitigated through the successful execution of broad based cost reduction programs 
while we expect demand to remain weak in the longer cycle energy  chemical and pharmaceutical businesses  with reduced capital investment  particularly in the chemical industry in mature markets such as north america  europe and japan  we expect our short cycle mro business to stabilize in in addition  with our expanded sales office in the middle east  and additional sales personnel in asia as well as russia and other cis countries  coupled with our increased presence in eastern europe that was enhanced by the december acquisition of krombach  we expect to offset potential further weakness in western markets with share gains in the above mentioned growing target markets 
considering all of the foregoing  we expect both sales and operating profit to be generally flat compared to controls our controls segment experienced a million decline in operating profit in compared to  driven largely by continued softness in the oil and gas and transportation end markets 
we anticipate a level of stabilization in certain of our target end markets in which we expect will result in a modest increase in sales and  together with a more aligned cost base  an operating profit approaching break even 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december  compared with million at december  our operating philosophy is to deploy cash provided from operating activities  when appropriate  to provide value to shareholders by paying dividends and or repurchasing shares  by reinvesting in existing businesses and by making acquisitions that will complement our portfolio of businesses 
concerns about global economic growth for industrial businesses and disruptions in the financial markets had a significant and adverse impact on our operating results in in response  we have initiated a variety of actions to generate operating cash and maintain liquidity these actions include restructuring initiatives which commenced in december  engineering expense reductions and other discretionary cost reduction initiatives 
as part of these efforts  we have reduced company wide employment  excluding the impact of acquisitions  by  people since december  representing a decline of 
through our cost reduction initiatives in  we achieved cost savings of approximately million 
we reduced our level of capital expenditures to million in  which compares to million in we did not repurchase shares in the open market in we have no borrowings outstanding under our five year million amended and restated credit agreement which expires in september of which million was committed to secure a letter of credit to support requirements of the consent decree for the goodyear  az site and we have no significant debt maturities coming due until the third quarter of  when senior unsecured notes having an aggregate principal amount of million mature 
our current cash balance of million  together with cash generated from future operations and million available under our revolving credit facility are expected to be sufficient to finance our short and long term capital requirements  as well as fund cash payments associated with our asbestos and environmental exposures and pension contributions 
while we believe our cost reduction initiatives have had a meaningful impact on our cost structure and operating cash requirements  to the extent global demand for industrial products and services declines further  we will have lower operating profit than we currently expect  and we may need to implement additional restructuring initiatives  both of which could have an adverse impact on our operating cash flow 
we have an estimated liability of million for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through  and while it is probable that we will incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after  which additional liabilities may be significant  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time 
similarly  we have an estimated liability of million related to environmental remediation costs projected through related to our superfund site in goodyear  arizona 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities  a key source of our liquidity  was million in  a decrease of million  or 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to this slight decrease resulted from higher pension contributions and lower cash based earnings  substantially offset by reduced working capital and lower tax payments 
pension plan estimates and assumptions included in our financial statements were estimated as of december   consistent with current accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
these assumptions were based on management s best estimates in consultation with its pension advisors at that time 
the significant decline in the funded status which occurred in  largely driven by lower asset returns  resulted in pension expense that was million higher in when compared to in addition  we made contributions of million to our defined benefit plans which compares to contributions of million in the increase in contributions primarily related to higher contributions to our us defined benefit plan to comply with certain pension protection act provisions and resulted  in part  from declines in the market value of investments during of the million in  million was contributed to our us defined benefit plan in december on a discretionary basis to improve the funded status of this plan and to reduce future expected contributions 
we currently expect to make pension contributions of approximately million in in addition  we expect that  based on current information  pension contributions in will exceed contributions 
total net asbestos payments were million  which included a million insurance settlement receipt from the highlands insurance company 
this compares to net asbestos payments of million in cash payments related to asbestos settlement and defense costs  net of related insurance recoveries  are expected to be approximately million in investing activities cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million used in the comparable period of the lower levels of cash flows used in investing activities were primarily due to the absence of million of payments we made for the delta and krombach acquisitions in also contributing to the decline was a decrease in capital spending of million capital expenditures were in  down from million in 
capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity  replacing equipment  supporting new product development and improving information systems 
we expect our capital expenditures to approach million compared to million in in february  we made a payment of million to complete our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares  through a short form merger  of merrimac  a designer and manufacturer of rf microwave components  subsystem assemblies and micro multifunction modules 
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of repayments of indebtedness  share repurchases and payments of dividends to shareholders 
cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the lower levels of cash flows used in financing activities in was driven by the absence of open market share repurchases  which compares to million of open market share repurchases in offsetting this favorable comparison in  million of short term debt was repaid and million less cash was received for stock options exercised 
financing arrangements at december   we had total debt of million as compared to million at december  net debt decreased by million to million at december   primarily reflecting higher cash balances 
the net debt to net capitalization was at december   down from at december  in september  we entered into a five year  million amended and restated credit agreement the facility  which is due to expire september  this facility amends and restates the five year million revolving credit agreement entered into on january   which included a million term loan component that was terminated by the company in may the facility allows us to borrow  repay  or to the extent permitted by the agreement  prepay and re borrow at any time prior to the stated maturity date  and the loan proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes including financing for acquisitions

we have domestic unsecured  uncommitted money market bid rate credit lines for million at december  as of december   we had various local currency credit lines  with maximum available borrowings of million  underwritten by banks primarily in the united states and europe 
these credit lines are typically available for borrowings up to days and are renewable at the option of the lender

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off balance sheet arrangements we are party to a contractually committed off balance sheet chattel paper financing facility that enabled our crane merchandising systems cms business to offer various sales support financing programs to its customers

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and  therefore  are critical to understanding our results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recorded when a product is shipped  title risk of loss passes to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue on long term  fixed price contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion 
sales under cost reimbursement type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
accounts receivable we continually monitor collections from customers  and in addition to providing an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon a customer s financial condition  we record a provision for estimated credit losses when customer accounts exceed days past due 
we aggressively pursue collection efforts on these overdue accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
inventories inventories include the costs of material  labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory values on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on historical performance and our forecast of product demand over the next two years 
as actual future demand or market conditions vary from those projected by us  adjustments will be required 
domestic inventories are stated at either the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out method lifo or the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we use lifo for most domestic locations  which is allowable under us gaap  primarily because this method was elected for tax purposes and thus required for financial statement reporting purposes 
inventories held in foreign locations are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method 
the lifo method is not being used at our foreign locations as such a method is not allowable for tax purposes 
liquidations of lifo inventories have increased cost of sales by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the portion of inventories costed using the lifo method was and  of consolidated inventories at december  and  respectively 
if inventories that were valued using the lifo method had been valued under the fifo method  they would have been higher by million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset or asset group  or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the long lived asset or asset group  as well as specific appraisal in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other long lived assets or asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
judgments we make which impact these assessments relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets  there is risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may require adjustment in future periods due to either changing assumptions or changing facts and circumstances 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic income taxes which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year s in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted 

table of contents part ii item based on consideration of all available evidence regarding their utilization  net deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
where  based on the weight of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some amount of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for that amount that  in our judgment  is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we account for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with asc topic  which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation  based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line of the consolidated statement of operations  while accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line of the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our business acquisitions typically result in the acquisition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we follow the provisions under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc as it relates to the accounting for goodwill in our consolidated financial statements 
these provisions require that we  on at least an annual basis  evaluate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and attributed and compare that fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
impairment testing takes place more often than annually if events or circumstances indicate a change in the impairment status 
a reporting unit is an operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment a component  in which case the component would be the reporting unit 
in certain instances  we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics 
at december   we had reporting units 
when performing our annual impairment assessment  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying value 
goodwill is considered to be potentially impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are established primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital which varies for each reporting unit and which  as of our most recent annual impairment assessment  ranged between and  reflecting the respective inherent business risk of each of the reporting units tested 
this methodology for valuing the company s reporting units commonly referred to as the income method has not changed since the prior year 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts  which change from year to year 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases reductions 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions  including changes in market conditions  and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
in addition to the foregoing  for each reporting unit  market multiples are used to corroborate our discounted cash flow results where fair value is estimated based on ebitda multiples determined by available public information of comparable businesses 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units  it is possible a material change could occur 
if actual results are not consistent with management s estimates and assumptions  goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 
furthermore  in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical  reasonably possible decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
the results of this hypothetical decrease would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our carrying value for each of our reporting units 
no impairment charges have been required during  and contingencies the categories of claims for which we have estimated our liability  the amount of our liability accruals  and the estimates of our related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings and other contingencies 
please refer to note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pension plans in the united states  we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately of all us employees 
the benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a final average pay basis  except for certain hourly employees where benefits are fixed per year of service 
this plan is funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service 
charges to expense are based upon costs computed by an independent actuary 
our funding policy is to contribute  annually  amounts that are allowable for federal or other income tax purposes 
these contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned in the future 
a number of our non us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately of all non us employees 
the benefits are typically based upon years of service and compensation 
these plans are generally funded with trustees in respect to past and current service 
charges to expense are based upon costs computed by independent actuaries 
our funding policy is to contribute  annually  amounts that are allowable for tax purposes or mandated by local statutory requirements 
these contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned in the future 
the net periodic pension cost was million in  in and million in employer cash contributions were million in  million in and million in we expect  based on current actuarial calculations  to contribute cash of approximately million to our pension plans in cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets  however  we expect pension contributions in will exceed contributions 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the pension plan  holding all other factors constant  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return of plan assets by percentage points would have increased us pension expense by million for us pension plans and million for us pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would have increased pension expense by million for us pension plans and million for non us pension plans 
see note  pension and postretirement benefits  to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 
the following key assumptions were used to calculate the benefit obligation and net periodic cost for the periods indicated pension benefits december  benefit obligations us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase non us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase net periodic benefit cost us plans discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase non us plans discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the long term expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions were determined with input from independent investment consultants and plan actuaries  utilizing asset pricing models and considering historic returns 
the discount rates we used for valuing pension liabilities are based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligation 
postretirement benefits other than pensions we and certain of our subsidiaries provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to current and former employees hired before january   who meet minimum age and years of service requirements 
we do not pre fund these benefits and retain the right to modify or terminate the plans 
we expect  based on current actuarial calculations  to contribute cash of million to our postretirement benefit plans in the weighted average discount rates assumed to determine postretirement benefit obligations were  and for  and  respectively 
the health care cost trend rates assumed was for  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposures to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
total debt outstanding of million at december  was generally at fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
the following is an analysis of the potential changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates based upon sensitivity analysis that models effects of shifts in rates 
these are not forecasts 
our year end portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate debt  therefore  the effect of a market change in interest rates would not be significant 
if  on january   currency exchange rates were to decline against the us dollar and the decline remained in place for  based on our year end portfolio  net income would not be materially impacted
