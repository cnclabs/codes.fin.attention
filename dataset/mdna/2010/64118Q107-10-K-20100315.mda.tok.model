overview we provide an on demand  integrated business management application suite that provides accounting erp  crm and ecommerce functionality to medium sized businesses and divisions of large companies 
we also offer customer support and professional services related to our suite 
we deliver our suite over the internet as a subscription service using the saas model 
in  we released our first application  netledger  which focused on accounting applications 
we then released ecommerce functionality in and crm and sales force automation functionality in in  we released our next generation suite under the name netsuite to which we have regularly added features and functionality 
in  we acquired openair and in we acquired quickarrow  both of which offer professional services automation and project portfolio management products 
our headquarters are located in san mateo  california 
we were incorporated in california in september and reincorporated in delaware in november we conduct our business worldwide  with international locations in canada  europe  asia and australia 
key components of our results of operations revenue our revenue has grown from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  we generate sales directly through our sales team and  to a lesser extent  indirectly through channel partners 
we sell our service to customers across a broad spectrum of industries  and we have tailored our service 
table of contents for wholesalers distributors  services companies and software companies 
the primary target customers for our service are medium sized businesses 
an increasing percentage of our customers and our revenue have been derived from larger businesses within this market 
for the year ended december   we did not have any single customer that accounted for more than of our revenue 
we are pursing a number of strategies that we believe will provide us with significant prospects for future growth 
the goals of those strategic objectives are to continue to move up market  to increase the use of netsuite as a platform and to extend the verticalization of our product line 
although we have made progress toward our goals in recent periods  there are still many areas where we believe that we can continue to grow 
to achieve these goals  we are focused on the following initiatives growth of sales of oneworld  which supports the needs of large  stand alone companies and divisions of very large enterprises  strengthening our professional services automation verticalization with the acquisition of quickarrow  and developing our suitecloud ecosystem to enable third parties to extend our offerings with their vertical expertise 
we experience competitive pricing pressure when our products are compared with solutions that address a narrower range of customer needs or are not fully integrated for example  when compared with ecommerce or crm stand alone solutions 
in addition  since we sell primarily to medium sized businesses  we also face pricing pressure in terms of the more limited financial resources or budgetary constraints of many of our target customers 
we do not currently experience significant pricing pressure from competitors that offer a similar on demand integrated business management suite 
we sell our application suite pursuant to subscription agreements 
the duration of these agreements is generally one year 
prior to  the majority of our customers entered into multi year agreements 
we believe one year agreements are more customary in our industry  align more with customer preferences and provide us with a more predictable sales compensation structure 
we rely in part on a large percentage of our customers to renew their agreements to drive our revenue growth 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their subscription period 
we generally invoice our customers in advance in annual or quarterly installments  and typical payment terms provide that our clients pay us within to days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced where the customer has a legal obligation to pay are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
as of december   we had deferred revenue of million 
backlog was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
backlog represents future billings under our non cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and  accordingly  are not recorded as deferred revenue 
we expect that the amount of backlog may change from year to year for several reasons  including specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements  varying billing cycles of non cancelable subscription agreements  the specific timing of customer renewals  foreign currency fluctuations  the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances 
for multi year subscription agreements billed annually  the associated backlog is typically high at the beginning of the contract period  zero immediately prior to expiration and increases if the agreement is renewed 
low backlog attributable to a particular subscription agreement is typically associated with an impending renewal and is not an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue of that customer 
accordingly  we expect that the amount of backlog may change from year to year depending in part upon the number of dollar amount of subscription agreements in particular stages in their renewal cycle 
such fluctuations are not reliable indicators of future revenues 
in most instances  revenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements comprised of subscription fees for access to our application suite and customer support  and fees for professional services 
we 
table of contents have determined that we do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each element of our sale agreements that contain a subscription to our on demand application suite and customer support  and fees for professional services 
as a result  the elements within our multiple element sales agreements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we account for fees received under multiple element arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement ratably over the term of the related agreement  commencing upon the later of the agreement start date or when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our subscription agreements provide service level commitments of uptime per period  excluding scheduled maintenance 
the failure to meet this level of service availability may require us to credit qualifying customers up to the value of an entire month of their subscription and support fees 
in light of our historical experience with meeting our service level commitments  we do not currently have any reserves on our balance sheet for these commitments 
the percentage of our revenue generated outside of north america was during  during and during as part of our overall growth  we expect the percentage of our revenue generated outside of north america to continue to increase as we invest in and enter new markets 
in  the company and netsuite kk entered into share purchase agreements  development fund agreements and preferred reseller agreement with tci  mjs and inspire corporation  unrelated japanese firms 
pursuant to the share purchase agreement  those firms acquired a ownership interest in netsuite kk 
under the terms of the development fund agreement  the company was required to undertake its best efforts to provide localization of the company s on demand application service for the japanese market  a process that was completed in the preferred reseller agreement provides tci and mjs with a three year right and five year right  respectively  to distribute the localized on demand application service in the japanese market with certain favorable pricing terms 
the distribution agreement with tci expired during in conjunction with these agreements  the company and netsuite kk received million from tci  including million in prepaid royalties  million from mjs  including  in prepaid royalties and  from inspire corporation 
all of the prepaid royalties had been used or refunded as of december  in december  the company purchased tci s ownership equity in netsuite kk for million 
subsequent to year end the company purchased the remaining ownership equity in netsuite kk from mjs and inspire corporation for aggregate consideration of million in cash 
the company recognized million  million and million in revenue related to the distribution agreements in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the amounts allocated to the equity investment in netsuite kk were recorded as equity and noncontrolling interest 
the amount allocated to prepaid royalties was recorded as a distributor advance in current liabilities see note to our consolidated financial statements for a further description of netsuite kk 
employees as of december   our headcount was employees including employees in sales and marketing  employees in operations  professional services  training and customer support  employees in product development  and employees in a general and administrative capacity 
we had employees at december  including employees in sales and marketing  employees in operations  professional services  training and customer support  employees in product development  and employees in a general and administrative capacity 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our application suite  providing customer support  data communications expenses  personnel and related costs of operations  professional services and 
table of contents training personnel  stock based compensation  software license fees  costs associated with website development activities  allocated overhead  intangible asset amortization expense associated with capitalized internal use software and acquired developed technology and related plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses 
the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than the cost associated with delivering our software services due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 
we allocate overhead such as rent  information technology costs and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category 
we expect cost of revenue to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue over time  however  it could fluctuate period to period depending on the growth of our professional services business and any associated increased costs relating to the delivery of professional services and the timing of significant expenditures 
additionally  we expect to further increase data center capacity in  which will further increase our cost of revenue 
we may also incur additional expenses associated with the acquisition of additional database software licenses 
operating expenses product development product development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our product development employees and executives  including salaries  stock based compensation  employee benefits and allocated overhead 
our product development efforts have been devoted primarily to increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand application suite as well as localizing our product for international use 
a key component of our strategy is to expand our business internationally 
this will require us to conform our application to comply with local regulations and languages  causing us to incur additional expenses related to translation and localization of our application for use in other countries 
we expect product development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we extend our service offerings in other countries and as we expand and enhance our application suite technologies 
such expenses may vary due to the timing of these offerings and technologies 
operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our sales and marketing employees and executives  including wages  benefits  bonuses  commissions and training  stock based compensation  commissions paid to our channel partners  the cost of marketing programs such as on line lead generation  promotional events  webinars and other meeting costs  amortization of intangible assets related to tradename and customer relationships  and allocated overhead 
we market and sell our application suite worldwide through our direct sales organization and indirect distribution channels such as strategic resellers 
we capitalize and amortize our direct and channel sales commissions over the period the related revenue is recognized 
the commission expense for customer renewals is at lower rates than for sales to new customers 
as such  we expect our commission expense to decline as a percentage of revenue going forward as a larger percentage of our recognized revenue is expected to result from customer renewals 
we believe that we have sufficient sales and marking staff to meet our revenue goals for in future periods we may need to continue to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new customers and expand relationships with existing customers 
our sales and marketing expenses have increased in absolute dollars although they have decreased as a percentage of total revenue over the past three years 
we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 

table of contents operating expenses general and administrative general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  stock based compensation  legal and other professional fees and other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our business 
income taxes since inception  we have incurred annual operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than provisions for minimum and foreign income taxes 
critical accounting policies and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  significant judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we consider these policies requiring significant management judgment to be critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  internal use software and website development costs  deferred commissions  accounting for stock based compensation  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
a description of our critical accounting policies and judgments for those areas are presented below 
in addition  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions and professional and support services 
in most instances  revenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application suite  professional services associated with consultation services and customer support 
we sell our application suite pursuant to service agreements that are generally one year in length  with some of our agreements having contract terms ranging up to three years in length 
while certain of our customers on occasion take possession of nonessential applications that facilitate data transfer and report review  our services do not provide our customers the right to take possession of the software supporting the on demand application suite at any time 

table of contents we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service is being provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
we have determined that we do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each element of our sales agreements that contain a subscription to our on demand application suite and customer support  professional services or both 
as a result  the elements within our multiple element sales agreements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
therefore  we account for fees received under our agreements that contain multiple elements as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement ratably over the term of the related agreement  commencing upon the later of the agreement start date or when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
amounts are initially recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue when our clients have been invoiced 
deferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition and are recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
we generally invoice our customers annually or in monthly or quarterly installments 
accordingly  the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year  non cancelable subscription agreements 
deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non current deferred revenue 
internal use software and website development costs the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment 
training costs are expensed as incurred 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
there were no impairments to internal use software during the years ended december   or deferred commissions we capitalize commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of customer contracts 
commission costs are accrued and capitalized upon execution of the sales contract by the customer 
payments to sales personnel are made shortly after the receipt of the related customer payment 
deferred commissions are amortized over the term of the related non cancelable customer contract and are recoverable through the related future revenue streams 
we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission costs are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be expensed over the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
accounting for stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation for equity grants made to our officers  directors and employees by using the intrinsic value method based on the difference  if any  between the estimated fair value of our common stock and the exercise price on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for share based payments  using the prospective transition method  which was applied only to new awards granted  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled  after 
table of contents the adoption date 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized beginning january  is based on the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted or modified after january  estimates are used in determining the fair value of such awards 
changes in these estimates could result in changes to our stock based compensation expense 
for all periods  we granted employees options to purchase shares of common stock at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the time of grant  as determined by our board of directors 
the fair value of options granted subsequent to december   the date of our initial public offering ipo  is based on the most recent closing sales price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the ipo price for our stock was considered in determining the value of options granted in the week preceding our ipo 
for options granted prior to the commencement of our ipo  the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of director after considering many factors  including our current and historical operating performance  our expected future operating performance  our financial condition at the grant date  the liquidation rights and other preferences of our preferred stock  any recent privately negotiated sales of our securities to independent third parties  our then current book value per share  input from management  the lack of marketability of our common stock  the potential future marketability of our common stock  and the business risks inherent in our business and in high technology companies generally 
restricted stock units are valued based on the fair value of the underlying shares of our common stock 
as a result of our stock based compensation activity  we recorded million  million and million of stock based compensation during the years ended december   and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of our acquired businesses to intangible assets  including customer relationships  developed technology and tradenames that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to seven years 
we also allocated a portion of the purchase price to tangible assets and assessed the liabilities to be recorded as part of the purchase price 
the estimates we made in allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets  and in assessing liabilities recorded as part of the purchase  involved the application of judgment and the use of estimates and these could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may exceed its fair value 
we evaluate impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value by computing our expected future discounted operating cash flows based on historical trends  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions as well as the market capitalization values of peer comparables 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the estimates we make in determining the fair value of the reporting unit involve the application of judgment  including the amount and timing of future cash flows  short and long term growth rates  and the weighted average cost of capital  potentially affecting the 
table of contents timing and size of any future impairment charges 
impairment of our goodwill could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
based on our most recent assessment  there were no goodwill impairment indicators 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
any write downs are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets 
we must use judgment in evaluating whether events or circumstances indicate that useful lives should change or that the carrying value of assets has been impaired 
any resulting revision in the useful life or the amount of impairment also requires judgment 
any of these judgments could affect the timing or size of any future impairment charges 
revision of useful lives or impairment charges could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
results of operations revenue and cost of revenue information about revenue  cost of revenue and gross profit was as follows for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross margin includes stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets compared to revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the same period in the overall increase in revenue was primarily the result of million in new revenue as a result of acquiring new customers customers acquired after december   the continued customer adoption of oneworld  an increase in average selling price per new customer and the incremental customer revenue resulting from the acquisition of quickarrow 
the increase in new revenue was offset by a million decrease in revenues from existing customers and other sources including our japanese distribution rights 
this decrease in revenues from existing customers is comprised of a million decrease in professional services revenue from those existing customers as a result of the nonrenewal of services  a million reduction of revenue recognized from our japanese distribution rights agreement  offset by a million net increase in existing customers purchases of subscriptions and support 
the nonrenewal of professional services by existing customers is a natural occurrence as such services are most frequently purchased in connection with the initial implementation of our product by new customers 
existing customers purchases of additional user subscriptions and modules or upsell largely offset the impact of customer churn and decreases in subscription and support revenues or downsell for existing customers 
we believe that the increase in both churn rate and downsell that we experienced in early are a result of global economic conditions

table of contents cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the same period in the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in personnel costs and a  increase in amortization of intangibles 
the increase in personnel costs is primarily associated with an increase in the number of employees required to support our growing client base and also included a million increase in stock based compensation

compared to revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to revenue from products introduced in was million 
million of the increase in revenues was from new customers those customers acquired after december  including the incremental customer revenue resulting from the acquisition of openair 
this increase in revenue from new customers reflects a increase in the average revenue recognized per new customer during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to these new customers adopting more elements of our service including netsuite oneworld  the purchase of openair products  the broader adoption of more costly industry specific vertical solutions and an increase in the size of our customers 
the remainder of the increase in revenues was primarily a result of upsell to existing customers exceeding decreases resulting from customer churn and downsells 
subscription and support revenues from existing customers those customers acquired before december  increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in those increases in sales and support revenues from existing customers were partially offset by the reduction in professional services revenues from those customers

the increase in personnel costs is associated with an increase in the number of employees required to support our growing client base 
those increases were partially offset by a million decrease in expenses for the use of external professional services that resulted from having additional in house resources available to perform those services

table of contents the decrease in other income expense during the year ended december  as compared to was primarily the result of the hedging program implemented in september and net foreign exchange rate gains and losses recognized during those periods 
during december  the company purchased tci s ownership equity in netsuite kk 
subsequent to year end  the company purchased the ownership equity from mjs and inspire corporation such that we currently own of netsuite kk

the decrease in other income expense during the year ended december  as compared to the same period during was primarily the result of net foreign exchange rate gains and losses recognized during those periods 
as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar  particularly during the third quarter of  we recorded million in net foreign exchange rate losses relating to the re measurement of certain asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency during the year ended december  as compared to  in foreign exchange rate gains during the year ended december  our provision for income taxes is primarily related to our international entities 
we expect our net operating loss carryforwards to offset any domestic earnings for the foreseeable future 
our provision for income taxes increased  during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to the increasing profitability in certain foreign jurisdictions and the settlement of certain historical foreign tax matters 
the increase in the benefit from net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in netsuite kk of  is due to the increasing losses at that unit during the year ended as compared to the same period in

we believe that as a result of global economic conditions we experienced an increase in both churn rate and downsell in early to date  we have not experienced any significant impact on our results of operations due to seasonality 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   our primary sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million in accounts receivable  net of allowance 
our cash and cash equivalents are comprised of the remaining unused portion of the million in proceeds from our december initial public offering that was allocated for working capital purposes 
in the year ended december   cash flows from operations resulted in a million source of cash 
although we have positive operating cash flows for three consecutive quarters ended december   the possibility remains that we could return to a position of having operating cash outflows in a future period 
despite the possibility of such fluctuations in operating cash outflows  management believes its current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient for the next months and into the foreseeable future thereafter to meet our operating cash flow needs 
management expects cash received from customers to be sufficient to cover operating expenses in future periods as our losses decrease 
we intend to use the cash provided from the initial public offering for general corporate purposes  including potential future acquisitions or other transactions 
further  during  we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with our international expansion and the localization of our service in new locations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents proceeds are adequate to fund those anticipated activities 
while we believe that our uncommitted current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months  we may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities  obtain a credit facility or sell certain assets 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
as we believe that our cash and cash equivalents are adequate to fund our operating and investing cash flow needs for at least the next twelve months  we have not found it necessary to reassess our capacity to generate cash from financing cash flows in the current economic climate 
we would expect to find it more difficult to raise cash in the near term than in prior periods as a result of the economic downturn that has occurred since our initial public offering 
if additional financing were to become necessary and we are unable to obtain the additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  potentially harming our business  financial condition and operating results 
in the meantime  we intend to continue to manage our cash in a manner designed to ensure that we have adequate cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations as well as future acquisitions  if any 
prior to our initial public offering that raised million in net proceeds in december  we financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred equity securities and common stock and a million line of credit from tako ventures  llc tako ventures  a related party

the line of credit expired in february restricted cash consisting of letters of credit for our facility lease agreements is included in long term other assets which totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have funded this deficit primarily through the net proceeds raised from the sale of our capital stock

the timing of our billings and collections relating to our sales and the timing of the payment of our liabilities have a significant impact on our cash flows 
cash flows from operations increased during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily as a result of an increase in revenues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  these amounts were held primarily in money market funds 
cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes  and restricted cash amounts are held as security against various lease obligations 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  euro  japanese yen  singapore dollar and philippine peso 
our revenue is generally denominated in the local currency of the contracting party 
the majority of our billings relate to sales occurring in the united states and therefore are denominated in us dollars 
we have an increasing percentage of sales denominated in foreign currencies including  but not limited to  the local currencies of canada  the uk  australia and japan 
our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located 
our expenses are incurred primarily in the united states  canada  the uk the philippines and australia  with a small portion of expenses incurred where our other international sales and operations offices are located 
our results of operations and cash flows are  therefore  subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
during and we undertook a hedging program to limit the exposure of foreign currency risk resulting from the revaluation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities through the use of forward exchange contracts 
all contracts that we entered into during the year expired before year end 
we expect to continue to enter into similar hedging transactions in future periods 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
during  foreign denominated revenues were approximately million and foreign denominated expenses were approximately million 
the effect of an adverse change in exchange rates on revenues and expenses during would result in a loss of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as our investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
