loss reserves workers compensation business we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at a given point in time 
in establishing our reserves  we do not use loss discounting  which involves recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 
our process and methodology for estimating reserves applies to both our voluntary and assigned risk business and does not include our reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements 
we record reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements as those reserves are reported to us by the pool administrators 
we use a consulting actuary to assist in the evaluation of the adequacy of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
when a claim is reported  we establish an initial case reserve for the estimated amount of our loss based on our estimate of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time 
generally  a case reserve is established within days after the claim is reported and consists of anticipated medical costs  indemnity costs and specific adjustment expenses  which we refer to as defense and cost containment expenses dcc 
at any point in time  the amount paid on a claim  plus the reserve for future amounts to be paid  represents the estimated total cost of the claim  or the case incurred amount 
the estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based upon various factors  including type of loss  severity of the injury or damage  age and occupation of the injured employee  estimated length of temporary disability  anticipated permanent disability  expected medical procedures  costs and duration  our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim  insurance policy provisions  including coverage  related to the claim  jurisdiction of the occurrence  and other benefits defined by applicable statute 
the case incurred amount can vary due to uncertainties with respect to medical treatment and outcome  length and degree of disability  employment availability and wage levels and judicial determinations 
as changes occur  the case incurred amount is adjusted 
the initial estimate of the case incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid  especially in circumstances involving severe injuries with comprehensive medical treatment 
changes in case incurred amounts  or case development  are an important component of our historical claim data 

table of contents in addition to case reserves  we establish reserves on an aggregate basis for loss and dcc expenses that have been incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
our ibnr reserves are also intended to provide for aggregate changes in case incurred amounts as well as the unpaid cost of recently reported claims for which an initial case reserve has not yet been established 
the third component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is our adjusting and other reserve  or ao reserve 
our ao reserve is established for the costs of future unallocated loss adjustment expenses for all known and unknown claims 
our ao reserve covers primarily the estimated cost of administering claims 
the final component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is the reserve for mandatory pooling arrangements 
we began writing workers compensation in in and  there was limited premium volume  with premiums beginning to increase substantially in in order to establish ibnr reserves  we project ultimate losses by accident year both through use of our historical experience  though limited  and the use of industry experience by state 
our consulting actuary projects ultimate losses in two different ways quarterly incurred development method use of amtrust factors 
quarterly incurred loss development factors are derived from amtrust s historical  cumulative incurred losses by accident month 
these factors are then applied to the latest actual incurred losses and dcc by month to estimate ultimate losses and dcc  based on the assumption that each accident month will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a similar manner to prior years 
given the limited historical experience  there is a substantial amount of judgment involved in this method 
yearly incurred development use of national council on compensation insurance  inc ncci industry factors by state 
yearly incurred loss development factors are derived from either ncci s annual statistical bulletin or state bureaus 
these factors are then applied to the latest actual incurred losses and dcc by year by state to estimate ultimate losses and dcc  based on the assumption that each year will develop to an estimated ultimate cost similar to the industry development by year by state 
each method produces estimated ultimate loss and dcc expenses net of amounts that will be ultimately paid by our excess of loss reinsurers 
our consulting actuary estimates a range of ultimate losses  along with a selection which gives more weight to the results from amtrust s monthly development factors and less weight to the results from industry development factors 
we establish ibnr reserves for our workers compensation segment by determining an ultimate loss pick  which is our estimate of our net loss ratio for a specific period  based on actual incurred losses and application of loss development factors 
we estimate our ultimate incurred loss and dcc for a period by multiplying the ultimate loss pick for the period by the earned premium for the period 
from that total  we subtract actual paid loss and dcc and actual case reserves for reported losses 
the remainder constitutes our ibnr reserves 
on a monthly basis  an outside actuary reviews our ibnr reserves 
on a quarterly basis  we review our determination of our ultimate loss pick 
management establishes our reserves by making judgments based on its application of our and industry wide loss development factors  consideration of our consulting actuary s application of the same loss development factors  and underwriting  claims handling and other operational considerations 
in utilizing its judgment  management makes certain assumptions regarding our business  including  among other things  frequency of claims  severity of claims and claim closure rates 
although we  upon our assumption of the administration of claims from third party administrators in  made adjustments to actual case reserves which impacted our loss development factors and  consequently our reserves  we have not made changes to any of our key assumptions regarding the performance of our business in comparison to the performance of the industry as a whole 
management makes its final selection of loss and dcc reserves after reviewing the actuary s results  consideration of other underwriting  claim handling and operational factors  and the use of judgment 
to establish our ao reserves  we review our past adjustment expenses in relation to past claims and estimate our future costs based on expected claims activity and duration 

table of contents as of december   our best estimate of our ultimate liability for workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expenses  net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers  was million  of which million was reserves from mandatory pooling arrangements as reported by the pool administrators 
this estimate was derived from the procedures and methods described above  which rely  substantially  on judgment 
estimating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inexact process a broad range exists around any estimate 
variability may be inherently greater given that amtrust has been writing substantial premiums for only a few years 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  it is possible that our actual loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred may vary significantly from our estimates 
the two methods described above are incurred development methods 
these methods rely on historical development factors derived from changes in our incurred losses  which are estimates of paid claims and case reserves over time 
as a result  if case reserving practices change over time  the two incurred methods may produce substantial variation in the estimate of ultimate losses 
because of our limited historical experience  we have not used any paid development methods  which rely on actual claims payment patterns and  therefore  are not sensitive to changes in case reserving procedures 
as our paid historical experience grows  we will consider using paid loss development methods 
of the two methods above  the use of industry loss development factors has consistently produced higher estimates of workers compensation losses and dcc expenses 
the table below shows this higher estimate  along with the lower estimate produced by amtrust s monthly factors as of december

amounts in millions loss dcc expense reserves mandatory pooling arrangements total gross workers compensation reserves lower estimate gross reserve higher estimate net workers compensation reserves lower estimate net reserve higher estimate the higher estimate would increase net reserves by million and reduce net income and stockholders equity by million 
the lower net estimate would decrease net reserves by million and increase net income and stockholders equity by million 
a change in our net loss and dcc expense reserve would not have an immediate impact on our liquidity  but would affect cash flows in future years as claim and expense payments made 
in  we recognized a million deficiency in prior year s reserves related primarily to our involuntary participation in the national workers compensation reinsurance pool or equivalent state pool which are administered by the national council on compensation insurance collectively  the ncci pools 
in  the company s liabilities for unpaid losses and lae attributable to prior years decreased by million as result of favorable development in both the small commercial business segment and specialty risk and extended warranty segment  partially offset by unfavorable development in our specialty middle market business segment as well as the company s involuntary participation in ncci pools 
in  the company s liabilities for unpaid losses and lae attributable to prior years decreased by million as result of favorable development in the small commercial business segment  partially offset by unfavorable development from the company s involuntary participation in ncci pools 
we do not anticipate that we will make any material reserve adjustments  but will continue to monitor the accuracy of our loss development factors and adequacy of our reserves 
as we write more business and develop more reliable data  we assign more weight to our individual loss development factors than to industry wide factors 
because our losses have developed more favorably than the industry as a whole  except for the ncci pools  our actuarially projected reserves have decreased 

table of contents specialty risk and extended warranty specialty risk and extended warranty claims are usually paid quickly  development on known claims is negligible  and generally  case reserves are not established 
ibnr reserves for warranty claims are generally pure ibnr  ie amounts for claims that occurred prior to an accounting date but are reported after that date 
the reporting lag for warranty ibnr claims is generally small  usually in the range of one to three months 
management determines warranty ibnr by examining the experience of individual coverage plans 
our consulting actuary  at the end of each calendar year  reviews our ibnr by looking at our overall coverage plan experience  with assumptions of claim reporting lag and average monthly claim payouts 
our net ibnr as of december  and for our specialty risk and extended warranty segment was million and million  respectively 
though we believe this is a reasonable best estimate of future claims development  this amount is subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty 
our actual net reserves  including ibnr  on specialty risk and extended warranty as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
an upward movement of on overall reserves would result in a reduction of income in of million before tax and million after tax 
a downward movement of on overall reserves would result in an increase of income of million before tax and million after tax 
there is generally more uncertainty in the unearned premium reserve than in the ibnr reserve 
in the specialty risk and extended warranty segment  the reserve for unearned premium is  in general  an estimate of our liability for projected future losses emanating from the unearned portion of written contracts 
our liability for return of unearned premium is not significant 
the reserve for specialty risk and extended warranty unearned premium is calculated by analyzing each coverage plan separately  subdivided by contract year  type of product and length of contract  ranging from one month to five years 
these subdivisions produced  in a recent analysis  about separate reserve calculations 
these individual reserve calculations may differ in actuarial methodologies depending on the type of warranty  the length of the contract  the availability of past loss experience  and the extent of current claim experience from the program administrators 
the primary actuarial methodology used to project future losses for the unexpired terms of contracts is to project the future number of claims  then multiply them by an average claim cost 
the future number of claims is derived by applying to unexpired months a selected ratio of the number of claims to expired months 
the selected ratio is determined from a combination of past experience of the same expired contracts  current experience of the earned portion of the in force contracts  and past and or current experience of similar type contracts 
the average claim cost is also determined by using past and or current experience of the same or similar contracts 
in order to confirm the validity of the projected future losses derived through application of the average claim cost method  we also utilize a loss ratio method 
the loss ratio method entails the application of the projected ultimate loss ratio  which is based on historical experience  to the unearned portion of the premium 
if the loss ratio method indicates that the average claim cost method has not produced a credible result for a particular coverage plan  the company will make a judgment as to the appropriate reserve for that coverage plan 
we generally will choose a point in the range between results generated by the average claim cost method and loss ratio method 
in making our judgment  we consider  among other things  the historical performance of the subject coverage plan or similar plans  our analysis of the performance of the administrator and coverage terms 

table of contents different specialty risk and extended warranty products have different patterns of incidence during the period of risk 
some products tend to show increasing incidence of claims during the risk period  others may show relatively uniform incidence of claims  while still others tend to show decreasing claim incidence 
we have assumed  on average  a uniform incidence of claims for all contracts combined  based on our review of contract provisions and claim history 
incorrect earnings of warranty policy premiums  inadequate pricing of warranty products  changes in conditions during long contract durations or incorrect estimates of future warranty losses on unexpired contracts may produce a deficiency or a redundancy in the unearned premium reserve 
our unearned premium reserve as of december  and for our specialty risk and extended warranty segment was million and million  respectively 
though we believe this is a reasonable best estimate of our unearned premium reserve  this amount is subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty 
property and casualty insurance we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expense related to the investigation and settlement of policy related claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated costs of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at a given point in time 
in establishing our reserves we do not use loss discounting 
we utilize the services of an independent consulting actuary to assist in the evaluation of the adequacy of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
when a claim is reported  an initial case reserve is established for the estimated amount of the loss based on the adjuster s view of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time 
initial case reserves are established within days of the claim report date and consist of anticipated liability payments  first party payments  medical costs  and defense and cost containment dcc expenses 
this establishes a case incurred amount for a particular claim 
the estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based upon various factors  such as line of business general liability  auto liability  or auto physical damage  severity of injury or property damage  number of claimants  statute of limitation and repose  insurance policy provisions  especially applicable policy limits and coverage limitations  expected medical procedures  costs  and duration treatment  our knowledge of circumstances surrounding the claim  and possible salvage and subrogation 
case incurred amounts can vary greatly because of the uncertainties inherent in the estimates of severity of loss  costs of medical treatments  judicial rulings  litigation expenses  and other factors 
as changes occur  the case reserves are adjusted 
the initial estimate of a claim s incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid when the claim is closed  especially in the circumstances involving litigation and severe personal injuries 
changes in case incurred amounts  also known as case development  are an important component of our historical claim data 
in addition to case reserves  we establish reserves on an aggregate basis for loss and dcc expenses that have been incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
our ibnr reserves are also intended to include aggregate development on known claims  provision for claims that re open after they have been closed  and provision for claims that have been reported but have not yet been recorded 
the third component of the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is the estimate of the ao reserve 
this reserve is established for the costs of future unallocated loss adjustment expenses for all known and unknown claims 
our ao reserve covers primarily the estimated cost of administering claims by our claim staff 

table of contents the final component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense is the reserve for the ncci pools 
ncci provides us both the ibnr and case reserves 
we began writing general liability  commercial auto and commercial property jointly known as cpp business in as a result  there is a limited amount of loss data available for analysis 
in order to establish ibnr reserves for cpp lines of business  we project ultimate losses by accident year through the use of industry experience by line 
the limited amount of cpp historical data has not allowed us to develop our own development patterns 
instead  we rely on three methods that utilize industry development patterns by line of business yearly incurred development use of industry factors by line 
for each line  the development factors are taken directly from insurance services office  inc iso loss development publications for a specific line of business 
these factors are then applied to the latest actual incurred losses and dcc by accident year  by line of business to estimate ultimate losses and dcc  expected loss ratio 
for each line  an expected loss ratio is taken from our original account level pricing analysis 
these loss ratios are then applied to the earned premiums by line by year to estimate ultimate losses and dcc  and bornhuetter ferguson method 
for each line  ibnr factors are developed from the applicable industry loss development factors and expected losses are taken from the original account level pricing analysis 
ibnr factors are then applied to the expected losses to estimate ibnr amount of loss and dcc 
the first two methods produce estimated ultimate loss and dcc expenses 
the third method produces an estimate of ibnr directly  without calculating ultimate loss and dcc first 
our consulting actuary estimates a range of ultimate losses  along with the recommended ibnr and reserve amounts 
for cpp lines of business  ultimate loss and ibnr selections are based on one of the above methods depending on the accident year and line of business 
because we determine our reserves based on industry incurred development patterns  our ultimate losses may differ substantially from our estimates produced by the above methods 
because of our very limited historical experience  we have not utilized any incurred development methods based on our experience  nor did we use any methods that rely on paid development factors 
paid loss development methods rely on actual claim payment patterns to develop ultimate loss and dcc estimates 
as our historical experience grows  we will consider using incurred development methods based on our historical loss development patterns  as well as paid development methods 
after the acquisition of ubi  we began writing commercial package business in the second quarter of we were able to access an extensive amount of ubi s historical loss data for analysis 
additionally  the claims adjusting has remained stable 
as such  it has allowed us to develop our own development patterns without the use of industry factors 
similar methods involved in determining reserves are consistent as described above for other property and casualty business

for example  with respect to the net loss reserves of million as of december   by december  two years later  million had actually been paid in settlement of the claims that relate to liabilities as of december  the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents  as of december   the difference between the latest re estimated liability and the amounts as originally estimated 
a redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate 
a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate 
the period from to relates primarily to business written prior to the acquisition of tic and ric by the company 
therefore  the high redundancies in these periods were attributable primarily to the runoff of these closed books of business

certain international tax considerations we operate our business in several foreign countries and are subject to taxation in several foreign jurisdictions 
a brief description of certain international tax considerations affecting us appears below 
we will be subject to us income taxation on any income of our foreign subsidiaries which is subpart f income 
bermuda bermuda currently does not impose any income  corporation or profits tax  withholding tax  capital gains tax or capital transfer tax on aii  our bermuda affiliate  or any estate duty or inheritance tax applicable to shares of aii except in the case of shareholders resident in bermuda 
except as set out in the following paragraph  no assurance can be given that aii will not be subject to any such tax in the future 
aii has received a written assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  that  if any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of that tax would not be applicable to 
table of contents aii or to any of its operations  shares  debentures or obligations until march   provided that the assurance is subject to the condition that it will not be construed to prevent the application of such tax to people ordinarily resident in bermuda  or to prevent the application of any taxes payable by aii in respect of real property or leasehold interests in bermuda held by it 
no assurance can be given that aii will not be subject to any such tax after march  for us federal income tax purposes  our bermuda subsidiaries are controlled foreign corporations 
a majority of the income of these subsidiaries  which consists primarily of foreign personal holding company income such as investment income and income from reinsuring risks  is categorized as subpart f income 
we must include in our taxable income for us federal income tax purposes this subpart f income 
ireland amtrust international underwriters limited aiu  a company incorporated in ireland  is managed and controlled in ireland and  therefore  is resident in ireland for irish tax purposes and subject to irish corporation tax on its worldwide profits including revenue profits and capital gains 
income derived by aiu from an irish trade that is  a trade that is not carried on wholly outside of ireland will be subject to irish corporation tax at the current rate of 
other income that is  income from passive investments  income from non irish trades and income from certain dealings in land is generally subject to irish corporation tax at the current rate of 
the irish revenue commissioners have published a statement indicating that deposit interest earned by an insurance company on funds held for regulatory purposes will be regarded as part of its trading income  and accordingly will be part of the profits taxed at 
this statement also indicates acceptance of case law which states that investment income of an insurance company will likewise be considered as trading income where it is derived from assets required to be held for regulatory capital purposes 
other investment income earned by aiu will generally be taxed in ireland at a rate of 
capital gains realized by aiu will generally be subject to irish corporation tax at an effective rate of 
for us federal income tax purposes  aiu is a controlled foreign corporation and its income generally will be included in our us federal taxable income 
a credit against us federal income tax liability is available for any irish tax paid on such income 
if aiu carries on a trade in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment in the uk  profits realized from such a trade in the uk will be subject to irish corporation tax notwithstanding that such profits may also be subject to taxation in the uk a credit against the irish corporation tax liability will be available for any uk tax paid on such profits  subject to the maximum credit being equal to the irish corporation tax payable on such profits 
for as long as the principal class of shares in amtrust financial services  inc is listed on a recognized stock exchange in an eu member state or country with which ireland has a tax treaty  and provided that such shares are substantially and regularly traded on that exchange  irish dividend withholding tax will not apply to dividends and other distributions paid by aiu to aii  provided that aii makes an appropriate declaration  in prescribed form  to aiu before the dividend is paid 
amtrust or any of its subsidiaries  other than aiu  will not be resident in ireland for irish tax purposes unless the central management and control of such companies is  as a matter of fact  located in ireland 
insurance companies are subject to an insurance premium tax in the form of a stamp duty charged at of certain premium income 
it applies to general insurance business  mainly business other than reinsurance  life insurance certain  maritime  aviation and transit insurance  and health insurance 

table of contents it applies to a premium in respect of a policy where the risk is located in ireland 
legislation provides that risk is located in ireland in the case of insurance of buildings together with their contents  where the building is in ireland  in the case of insurance of vehicles  where the vehicle is registered in ireland  in the case of insurance of four months or less duration of travel or holiday if the policyholder took out the policy in ireland  and in all three cases of insurance where the policyholder is resident in ireland  or if not an individual  where the head office of the policyholder is in ireland or its branch to which the insurance relates is in ireland 
luxembourg achl  a luxembourg holding company  is owned by aii  our bermuda insurance company 
achl owns all of the issued and outstanding stock of five luxembourg domiciled captive insurance companies that had accumulated equalization reserves  which are catastrophe reserves in excess of required reserves which are determined by a formula based on the volatility of the business reinsured 
because aii is an insurance company with the ability to cede losses  the captives are well positioned to utilize their equalization reserves 
luxembourg does not impose any income  corporation or profits tax on achl provided sufficient losses cause the equalization reserves to be exhausted 
however  if the captives cease to write business or are unable to utilize their equalization reserves  they will ultimately recognize income which will be taxed by luxembourg at a rate of approximately for us federal income tax purposes  achl is a controlled foreign corporation and its taxable income  if any  will be included in our us federal taxable income 
a credit against us federal income tax liability is available for any luxembourg tax paid on such income 
united kingdom igi  a company incorporated in the united kingdom  is managed and controlled in the uk and  therefore  is treated as a resident in the uk for british tax purposes and subject to british corporation tax on its worldwide profits including revenue profits and capital gains 
income derived by igi will be subject to british corporation tax at the rate of 
for us federal income tax purposes  igi is a controlled foreign corporation and its income generally will be included in our us federal taxable income 
a credit against us federal income tax liability is available for any british tax paid on such income 
if igi carries on a trade in ireland through a permanent establishment in ireland  profits realized from such a trade in ireland will be subject to uk corporation tax notwithstanding that such profits may also be subject to taxation in ireland 
a credit against the british corporation tax liability is available for any irish tax paid on such profits  subject to the maximum credit being equal to the british corporation tax payable on such profits 
igi may pay dividends to aii  its direct parent company  free of uk withholding tax 
we expect that neither amtrust nor any of its subsidiaries  other than igi  will be resident in the uk for british tax purposes unless the central management and control of such companies is  as a matter of fact  located in the uk a company not resident in the uk for british tax purposes can be subject to british corporation tax if it carries on a trade through a branch or agency in the uk or disposes of certain specified assets eg  british land  minerals  or mineral rights  or unquoted shares deriving the greater part of their value from such assets 
in such cases  the charge to british corporation tax is limited to trading income connected with the branch or agency  capital gains on the disposal of assets used in the branch or agency which are situated in the uk at or before the time of disposal  capital gains arising on the disposal of specified assets  with tax imposed at the rates discussed above  plus uk income tax generally by way of withholding on certain uk source income 
insurance companies are subject to an insurance premium tax at 
the premium tax applies to premiums for most general insurance  such as for buildings and contents and motor insurance  where the insured 
table of contents risk is in the uk 
life assurance and other long term insurance remain exempt  though there are anti avoidance rules surrounding long term medical care policies 
as an anti avoidance measure  the rate increases to for insurance sold by suppliers of specified goods or services  ie mechanical breakdown insurance  travel insurance irrespective of supplier  insurance sold with tv and car hire and  from april  forward  any non financial guaranteed asset protection gap insurance sold through suppliers of motor vehicles or persons connected with them 
in further anti avoidance measures introduced march   the definition of premium was amended to make it clear that any payment received in respect of a right to require an insurer to provide  or offer to provide  cover under a taxable contract of insurance is regarded as a premium 
ratings many insurance buyers  agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by am best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance 
aii  technology insurance company  inc tic and rochdale insurance company ric were each assigned a letter rating of a excellent by am best in and wesco insurance company wic was assigned a letter rating of a excellent by am best in july and aiu was assigned a letter rating of a excellent by am best in milwaukee casualty insurance company mcic  security national insurance company snic  amtrust insurance company of kansas  inc aick and trinity lloyd s insurance company tlic were assigned a letter rating of a excellent by am best in these ratings have since remained unchanged 
igi was assigned a letter rating of a excellent by am best in august aiic is not currently rated by am best 
an a rating is the th highest of the categories used by am best  and is assigned to companies that have  in am best s opinion  an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
these ratings were derived from an in depth evaluation of our subsidiaries balance sheets strengths  operating performances and business profiles 
am best evaluates  among other factors  the company s capitalization  underwriting leverage  financial leverage  asset leverage  capital structure  quality and appropriateness of reinsurance  adequacy of reserves  quality and diversification of assets  liquidity  profitability  spread of risk  revenue composition  market position  management  market risk and event risk 
am best ratings are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors 
competition the insurance industry  in general  is highly competitive and there is significant competition in the commercial business insurance sector 
competition in the insurance business is based on many factors  including coverage availability  claims management  safety services  payment terms  premium rates  policy terms  types of insurance offered  overall financial strength  financial ratings assigned by independent rating organizations  such as am best  and reputation 
some of the insurers with which we compete have significantly greater financial  marketing and management resources and experience than we do 
we may also compete with new market entrants in the future 
our competitors include other insurance companies  state insurance pools and self insurance funds 
more than one hundred insurance companies participate in the workers compensation market 
the insurance companies with which we compete vary by state and by the industries we target 
we believe our competitive advantages include our underwriting and claims management practices and systems and our am best rating of a excellent 
in addition  we believe that our insurance is competitively priced and that our premium rates are typically lower than those for policyholders assigned to the state insurance pools  allowing us to provide a viable alternative for policyholders in those pools 
we believe that the specialty risk and extended warranty sector in which we do business is not as developed as most other insurance sectors including workers compensation insurance 
we believe that our european specialty risk and extended warranty team is recognized for its expertise in this market 
nonetheless  we face significant competition  including several internationally well known insurers that have significantly greater financial  marketing and management resources and experience than we 
we believe that our competitive advantages include the ability to provide technical assistance to warranty providers  experienced underwriting  resourceful claims management practices and good relations with the leading warranty administrators in the european union 

table of contents our specialty middle market business segment employs a niche strategy that helps differentiate its offerings versus competitors  as most competing carriers pursue larger transactions 
we do not compete for high exposure business and prefer to underwrite less volatile classes of business 
the company maintains the requisite am best rating and financial size to compete favorably for target business 
regulation general the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and the european union especially  ireland and england and are subject to relatively less regulation in bermuda 
united states we have eight operating insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the united states  ric  tic  wic  aiic  mcic  snic  aick and tlic the us insurance subsidiaries 
holding company regulation all or nearly all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems 
each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
these laws require disclosure of material transactions within the holding company system as well as prior notice of or approval for certain transactions including the payment of certain dividends 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation 
change of control the insurance holding company laws of all or nearly all states require advance approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer 
control is generally defined as the possession  direct or indirect  of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company  whether through the ownership of voting securities  by contract except a commercial contract for goods or non management services or otherwise 
control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
in addition  insurance laws in many states contain provisions that require pre notification to the insurance commissioners of a change of control of certain non domestic insurance companies licensed in those states 
any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of including a change of control of amtrust  would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval of the department of insurance in the state in which the insurance company being acquired is domiciled and in any other state in which the company may be deemed to be commercially domiciled by reason of concentration of our insurance business within such state and may also require pre notification in the states where pre notification provisions have been adopted 
obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of  or deter  any such transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of amtrust  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of the stockholders of amtrust might consider to be desirable 
state insurance regulation insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and  to a lesser extent  other states in which they conduct business 
the primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders 
state insurance authorities have broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers  including among other things  the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business  set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained  determine the nature of  and limitations on  investments and dividends  approve policy forms and rates in some instances 
table of contents and regulate unfair trade and claims practices 
in particular  workers compensation policy forms and rates are closely regulated in all or nearly all states 
workers compensation insurers are also subject  to some degree  to regulation by the workers compensation regulators in the states in which they provide such insurance 
the company s us insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed financial statements and other reports with the departments of insurance in all states in which they are licensed to transact business 
these financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are filed 
in addition  many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from a particular market 
for example  states may limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies 
furthermore  certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption 
laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of the us insurance subsidiaries to exit unprofitable markets 
insurance producers  third party administrators  claims adjusters and service contract providers and administrators are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states in which they conduct business 
our subsidiaries  amtrust north america  inc  amtrust north america of florida  inc  amt warranty corp  igi underwriting agency  inc and the princeton agency  inc are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states 
federal and state legislative and regulatory changes from time to time  various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry 
among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures some of which proposals have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
the extreme turmoil in the financial markets has increased the likelihood of changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated 
for example  the us federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years and  since january  the us treasury department  as part of its broad proposal to reform regulation of the financial services industry  has proposed legislation that would impact the insurance industry 
we are unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted or the effect  if any  these developments would have on our operations and financial condition 
tria  as extended by triea and tripra  requires that commercial property and casualty insurance companies offer coverage with certain exceptions  such as with respect to commercial auto liability for certain acts of terrorism and has established a federal assistance program through the end of to help such insurers cover claims for terrorism related losses 
tria covers certified acts of terrorism  and the us secretary of the treasury must declare the act to be a certified act of terrorism for it to be covered under this federal program 
in addition  pursuant to tripra  no certified act of terrorism will be covered by the tria program unless the aggregate insurance industry losses from the act exceed million 
under tripra  the federal government covers for acts of the losses from covered certified acts of terrorism on commercial risks in the united states only  in excess of a deductible amount 
this deductible is calculated as a percentage of an affiliated insurance group s prior year premiums on commercial lines policies with certain exceptions  such as commercial auto policies covering risks in the united states 
this deductible amount is of such premiums 
specific federal regulatory developments include the introduction of legislation in congress that would repeal the mccarran ferguson act antitrust exemption for the insurance industry 
the antitrust exemption allows insurers to compile and share loss data  develop standard policy forms and manuals and predict future loss costs with greater reliability  among other things 
the ability of the industry  under the exemption permitted in the mccarran ferguson act  to collect loss cost data and build a credible database as a means of predicting future loss costs is an important part of cost based pricing 
if the ability to collect this data were removed  the predictability of future loss costs and the reliability of pricing could be undermined 

table of contents state insurance department examinations as part of their regulatory oversight process  state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the financial reporting of insurance companies domiciled in their states  generally once every three to five years 
examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
current ongoing routine examinations include aick  by the kansas insurance department for market conduct for the period ended december   snic and tlic  by the texas department of insurance  for the period ended december  and ric  by the new york department of insurance  for the period ended december  examinations of the financial conditions of tic and wic were made as of december   by the new hampshire insurance department and delaware insurance department  respectively 
neither ric  tic nor wic has been the subject of an examination of its market conduct  which would involve review by an insurance department of its compliance with laws governing marketing  underwriting  claims handling and other aspects of its insurance business 
an examination of the financial condition of aiic  and mcic were made by the each insurance company s respective state insurance department prior to its acquisition by amtrust 
guaranty fund assessments in most  if not all  of the states where we are licensed to transact business  there is a requirement that property and casualty insurers doing business within each such state participate in a guaranty association  which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired  insolvent or failed insurers 
these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by the member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional guaranty association assessments to our us insurance subsidiaries at some future date 
at this time  we are unable to determine the impact  if any  such assessments may have on their financial positions or results of their operations 
each of our us insurance subsidiaries as of december   has established or will establish accruals for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings 
residual market programs many of the states in which our us insurance subsidiaries conduct business or intend to conduct business  require that all licensed insurers which provide workers compensation insurance participate in a program to provide workers compensation insurance to those employers that have not or cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis 
the level of required participation in such residual market programs of insurers  is generally determined by calculating the volume of the voluntarily issued business in that state of the particular insurer as a percentage of all voluntarily issued business in that state by all insurers 
the resulting factor is the proportion of the premiums the insurer must accept as a percentage of all premiums for policies issued in that state s residual market program 
insurance companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by either issuing insurance policies to employers assigned to them  or participating in the ncci pools where the results of all policies provided through the ncci pools  are shared by the participating companies 
currently  our us insurance subsidiaries satisfy their residual market obligations by participating in the ncci pools 
none of the us insurance subsidiaries issues policies to employers assigned to them except to the extent that we act as a servicing carrier for workers compensation assigned risk plans in arkansas  illinois  indiana  georgia and virginia assigned risk plans 
coverage provided by the assigned risk plans is offered through servicing carriers  which issue policies to employers assigned to them by the assigned risk plan s administrator 
polices issued pursuant to the assigned risk plans are reinsured by the ncci pool  which are funded by assessments on insurers which write workers compensation insurance in the states which participate in the pools 
tic acts as a servicing carrier for the assigned risk plans 
servicing carrier contracts are generally are awarded based on a 
table of contents competitive bidding process 
as a servicing carrier  we receive fee income for our services but do not retain any underwriting risk  which is fully reinsured by the ncci pools 
we began writing policies effective january  second injury funds a number of states operate trust funds that reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
these state managed trust funds are funded through assessments against insurers and self insurers providing workers compensation coverage in a particular state 
the company received recoveries of approximately million  million and million from such state managed trust funds in  and  respectively 
the aggregate amount of cash paid by the company for assessments to state managed trust funds for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
risk based capital regulations our us insurance subsidiaries are required to report their risk based capital based on a formula developed and adopted by the naic that attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in the insurer s mix of products and investment portfolio 
the formula is designed to allow insurance regulators to identify weakly capitalized companies 
under the formula  a company determines its risk based capital by taking into account certain risks related to the insurer s assets including risks related to its investment portfolio and ceded reinsurance and the insurer s liabilities including underwriting risks related to the nature and experience of its insurance business 
at december   our us insurance subsidiaries risk based capital level exceeded the minimum level that would trigger regulatory attention 
insurance regulatory information system ratios the insurance regulatory information system  or iris  was developed by the naic and is intended primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer s business 
as of december  tic had no ratios outside the usual range 
each of ric and aiic had one ratio outside the usual ranges  each of snic  aick  mcic and tlic had two ratios outside the usual ranges and wic had three ratios  outside the usual ranges 
snic  mcic and tlic had ratios outside the usual range due to an increase in written premium  which was a function of the company s continued growth 
aiic had a ratio outside the usual range due to a decrease in written premium  which was a function of the company s moving florida workers compensation premium onto tic 
in addition  ric  aick  mcic and tlic had an unusual value related to investment yield  this was a result of decreasing yields on cash and short term investments 
the remaining ratios three ratios for wic and one for each of snic and aick outside the usual range are a function of an intercompany reinsurance agreement in which wic  snic and aick cede to aii and tic  respectively  and of subject premium 
statutory accounting principles statutory accounting principles  or sap  are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
sap is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
gaap is concerned with a company s solvency  but is also concerned with other financial measurements  principally income and cash flows 
accordingly  gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap as compared to sap 

table of contents statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted in part by the new york  new hampshire  delaware  florida  wisconsin  kansas and texas insurance regulators  determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of ric  tic  wic  aiic  mcic  snic  aick and tlic and thus determine  in part  the amount of funds that are available to pay dividends to amtrust 
privacy regulations in  congress enacted the gramm leach bliley act  which  among other things  protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information 
subsequently  a majority of states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues 
these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions  including insurance and finance companies  and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders and to fully disclose our privacy practices to our policyholders 
we may also be exposed to future privacy laws and regulations  which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition 
in  the naic adopted the privacy of consumer financial and health information model regulation  which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the gramm leach bliley act 
in  to further facilitate the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act  the naic adopted the standards for safeguarding customer information model regulation 
several states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information 
we have established policies and procedures to comply with the gramm leach bliley related privacy requirements 
credit for reinsurance in addition to regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed  reinsurers business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states of the united states governing credit for reinsurance that are imposed on their ceding companies 
in general  a ceding company obtaining reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed  accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the ceding company files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the ceding company s liability for unearned premiums which are that portion of premiums written which applies to the unexpired portion of the policy period  loss reserves and loss expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer 
aii  which reinsures risks of our us insurance subsidiaries  is not licensed  accredited or approved in any state in the united states 
the great majority of states  however  permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non licensed or non accredited reinsurer to be recognized to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit  trust fund or other acceptable security arrangement

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k and other documents we file with the sec include the following risks related to our business current economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
negative trends in business investment  consumer confidence and spending  the volatility of the capital markets  the availability of credit and the rate of unemployment can adversely affect our business 
and  although we have not seen material decreases in new business activity or reported payrolls  a prolonged economic downturn or a sustained period of high unemployment and or tight credit could adversely impact our future growth and profitability 
although we continue to closely monitor market conditions  we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our premium volume  the value of our investment portfolio and our financial performance 
as a result of these current economic conditions  we could experience future decreases in business activity and incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio  both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
we are liable for losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies we underwrite 
therefore  we must establish and maintain reserves for our estimated liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses with respect to our entire insurance business 
if we fail to accurately assess the risks associated with the business and property that we insure  our reserves may be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
we establish loss reserves that represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured events that have occurred  including events that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us 
our loss reserves are based on estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims and on actuarial estimation techniques 
these estimates are based on historical information and on estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency of claims and changes in the average cost of claims that may arise in the future 
they are inherently uncertain and do not represent an exact measure of actual liability 
judgment is required to determine the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under current facts and circumstances 
the interpretation of this historical data can be impacted by external forces  principally legislative changes  economic fluctuations and legal trends 
if there were unfavorable changes in our assumptions  our reserves may need to be increased 
any increase in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings 
in particular  workers compensation claims  often are paid over a long period of time 
in addition  there are no policy limits on our liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance 
therefore  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other types of insurance claims with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
if we change our reserve estimates for any line of business  these changes would result in adjustments to our reserves and our loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the period in which the estimates are changed 
if the estimate were increased  our pre tax income for the period in which we make the change will decrease by a corresponding amount 
an increase in reserves could result in a reduction in our surplus which could result in a downgrade in our am best rating 
such a downgrade could  in turn  adversely affect our ability to sell insurance policies 
a downgrade in the am best rating of our insurance subsidiaries would likely reduce the amount of business we are able to write 
rating agencies evaluate insurance companies based on their ability to pay claims 
our domestic insurance subsidiaries  tic  ric  wic  mcic  snic  aick and tlic  our irish subsidiary aiu  our united kingdom subsidiary  igi  and our bermuda subsidiary  aii  each currently has a financial strength rating of a excellent from am best  which is the rating agency that we believe has the most influence on our 
table of contents business 
this rating  which is the fourth highest of rating levels  is assigned to companies that  in the opinion of am best  have demonstrated an excellent overall performance when compared to industry standards 
am best considers a rated companies to have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
the ratings of am best are subject to periodic review using  among other things  proprietary capital adequacy models  and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by the am best rating of our insurance subsidiaries 
am best ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agencies and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy  hold or sell securities 
there can be no assurance that tic  ric  wic  mcic  snic  aick  tlic  aiu  igi and aii will be able to maintain their current ratings 
any downgrade in ratings would likely adversely affect our business through the loss of certain existing and potential policyholders and the loss of relationships with independent agencies 
some of our policyholders are required to maintain workers compensation coverage with an insurance company with an am best rating of a excellent or better 
we are not able to quantify the percentage of our business  in terms of premiums or otherwise  that would be affected by a downgrade in our am best rating 
the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical in nature  which may affect our overall financial performance 
historically  the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess capacity known as a soft market followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity known as a hard market 
although an individual insurance company s financial performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics  the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern 
because this cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors beyond our control  we cannot predict with certainty the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle 
we experienced increased price competition in certain of our target markets during  and  and these cyclical patterns  the actions of our competitors  and general economic factors could cause our revenues and net income to fluctuate  which may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile 
if market conditions cause our reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable  we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase quota share reinsurance and excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance 
pursuant to our quota share reinsurance agreement with maiden insurance company  ltd 
maiden insurance  maiden insurance reinsures approximately of our net retained premiums the maiden quota share 
in addition  we purchase reinsurance on an excess of loss and catastrophe basis for protection against catastrophic events and other large losses 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase  which may affect the level of our business and profitability 
the maiden quota share has a three year term  which  subject to the occurrence of certain early termination events which permit either party to terminate on days written notice  will renew automatically for successive three year terms unless one of the parties notifies the other of its election not to renew not less than nine months prior to the expiration of any such three year term 
the maiden quota share has been renewed for a three year term commencing july  and expiring june  our excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities  including the maiden quota share  or to obtain other reinsurance in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
increases in the cost of reinsurance would adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance on favorable terms  either our net exposure to risk would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures  we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite 

table of contents retentions in various lines of business expose us to potential losses 
we retain risk for our own account on business underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries 
the determination to reduce the amount of reinsurance we purchase or not to purchase reinsurance for a particular risk or line of business is based on a variety of factors including market conditions  pricing  availability of reinsurance  the level of our capital and our loss history 
such determinations have the effect of increasing our financial exposure to losses associated with such risks or in such lines of business and in the event of significant losses associated with such risks or lines of business could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to recover amounts due from our third party reinsurers which would adversely affect our financial condition 
reinsurance does not discharge our obligations under the insurance policies we write  it merely provides us with a contractual right to seek reimbursement on certain claims 
we remain liable to our policyholders even if we were unable to make recoveries that we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts 
as a result  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
losses are recovered from our reinsurers after underlying policy claims are paid 
the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we recover amounts to which we are entitled 
therefore  if a reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations to us  we would be responsible for claims and claim settlement expenses for which we would have otherwise received payment from the reinsurer 
if we were unable to collect these amounts from our reinsurers  our financial condition would be adversely affected 
as of december   we had an aggregate amount of approximately million of recoverables from third party reinsurers on paid and unpaid losses 
our relationship with maiden holdings  ltd 
and its subsidiaries may present  and make us vulnerable to  difficult conflicts of interest  related party transactions  business opportunity issues and legal challenges

in addition  potential conflicts of interest may arise should the interests of the company and maiden diverge 
mr 
zyskind s service as our president and chief executive officer and chairman of the board of maiden could also raise a potential challenge under anti trust laws 
section of the clayton antitrust act  or the clayton act  prohibits a person from serving as a director or officer in any two competing corporations under certain circumstances 
if the company and maiden were in the future deemed to be competitors within the meaning of the clayton act and certain thresholds relating to direct competition between amtrust and maiden are met  the department of justice and federal trade commission could challenge the arrangement 
our relationship with american capital acquisition corporation and its subsidiaries may present  and make us vulnerable to  difficult conflicts of interest  related party transactions  business opportunity issues and legal challenges 
american capital acquisition corporation acac is an insurance holding company owned by the michael karfunkel grantor retained annuity trust the trust  which in turn is controlled by michael karfunkel karfunkel  karfunkel  individually  and the company

in addition  karfunkel is the chairman of the board of directors of acac and barry d 
zyskind  the company s chief executive officer  president and director  is serving as an executive of acac on an interim basis 
conflicts of interest could arise with respect to business opportunities that could be advantageous to acac or its subsidiaries  on the one hand  and us or our subsidiaries  on the other hand 
in addition  potential conflicts of interest could arise were the interests of amtrust and acac to diverge 
we are dependent on maiden for commission and fee income 
we are dependent on maiden for commission and fee income through the maiden quota share by which maiden insurance reinsures amtrust s insurance subsidiaries  the asset management agreement between maiden and maiden insurance and our subsidiary  aii insurance management ltd  by which we manage maiden s and maiden insurance s invested assets  and the reinsurance brokerage agreement  by which our subsidiary  aii reinsurance broker limited provides maiden insurance certain reinsurance brokerage services 
pursuant to the maiden quota share  we receive ceding commission of of ceded written premiums on all business except retail commercial package business 
effective june   the maiden quota share was amended to include retail commercial package business 
we receive a ceding commission of for the retail commercial package business 
the maiden quota share  which had an initial term of three years  has been renewed for a successive three year term until june  and will automatically renew for successive three year terms  unless either aii or maiden insurance notifies the other of its election not to renew not less than nine months prior to the end of any such three year term 
in addition  either party is entitled to terminate on thirty day s notice or less upon the occurrence of certain early termination events  which include a default in payment  insolvency  change in control of aii or maiden insurance  run off  or a reduction of or more of the shareholders equity of maiden insurance or the combined shareholders equity of aii and the amtrust ceding insurers 
pursuant to the asset management agreement  we receive a quarterly fee equal to per annum which is reduced to per annum if the average invested assets for the quarter exceed billion 
the asset management agreement has a one year term and will renew automatically for successive one year terms unless notice of intent not to renew is provided 
pursuant to the reinsurance brokerage agreement  we receive a brokerage commission equal to of the premium ceded to maiden insurance under the quota share reinsurance agreement 
there is no assurance that these arrangements will remain in place beyond their current terms and we may not be able to readily replace these arrangements if they terminate 
if we were unable to continue or replace our current reinsurance arrangements on equally favorable terms  our underwriting capacity and commission and fee income could decline  we could experience a downgrade in our am best rating  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
catastrophic losses or the frequency of smaller insured losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
property and casualty insurers are subject to claims arising from catastrophes 
catastrophes can cause losses in multiple property and casualty lines  including property and workers compensation 
workers compensation constitutes approximately of our business and we write commercial property insurance in our specialty middle market business segment and our small commercial business segment 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes  such as hurricanes  windstorms and large scale terrorist attacks  are inherently unpredictable  and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
in addition  it is possible that we may experience an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period 
in either case  the consequences 
table of contents could be substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to write new business 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to these types of catastrophic and cumulative losses  including through the use of reinsurance  the severity or frequency of these types of losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance coverage 
if we do not adequately establish our premiums  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
in general  the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and  therefore  before all of our underlying costs are known 
like other insurance companies  we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates 
establishing adequate premiums is necessary  together with investment income  to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses and other underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
if we do not accurately assess the risks that we assume  we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses  which could reduce our net income and cause us to become unprofitable 
for example  when initiating workers compensation coverage on a policyholder  we estimate future claims expense based  in part  on prior claims information provided by the policyholder s previous insurance carriers 
if this prior claims information were incomplete or inaccurate  we may under price premiums by using claims estimates that are too low 
as a result  our actual costs for providing insurance coverage to our policyholders may be significantly higher than our premiums 
in order to set premiums accurately  we must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our insureds  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulas  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both frequency and severity of our insureds losses with reasonable accuracy 
we also must implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions 
our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and  as a result set premiums accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  principally insufficient reliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions  our inability to implement appropriate rating formulas or other pricing methodologies  regulatory constraints on rate increases  unexpected escalation in the costs of ongoing medical treatment  our inability to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses  and unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action 
our workers compensation  commercial automobile  general liability  and commercial property insurance premium rates are generally established for a term of no less than twelve months 
consequently  we could set our premiums too low  which would negatively affect our results of operations and our profitability  or we could set our premiums too high  which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues 
we may not be able to successfully acquire or integrate additional business 
from time to time we may pursue additional acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long term objectives 
the process of integrating an acquired business or company can be complex and costly  however  and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
we believe that certain of our competitors also may plan to make similar acquisitions 
the costs and benefits of 
table of contents future acquisitions are uncertain 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire additional existing business on acceptable terms or that we will be successful in integrating any business that we acquire 
if our businesses do not perform well  we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired  we would be required to write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment  with a corresponding charge to net income 
such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
negative developments in the workers compensation insurance industry would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
although we engage in other businesses  approximately of our premium currently is attributable to workers compensation insurance 
as a result  negative developments in the economic  competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the workers compensation insurance industry could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  if legislators in one of our larger markets were to enact legislation to increase the scope or amount of benefits for employees under workers compensation insurance policies without related premium increases or loss control measures  this could negatively affect the workers compensation insurance industry 
negative developments in the workers compensation insurance industry could have a greater effect on us than on more diversified insurance companies that also sell many other types of insurance 
in florida  our second largest state for underwriting workers compensation insurance premiums  insurance regulators set the premium rates we may charge 
the florida insurance regulators may set rates below those that we require to maintain profitability 
for example  the florida office of insurance regulation oir approved overall average decreases in premium rates for all workers compensation insurance policies written by florida licensed insurers totaling approximately between and in october of  the oir approved an additional rate decrease effective for january  a decline in the level of business activity of our policyholders could negatively affect our earnings and profitability 
in  primarily all of our workers compensation gross premiums written were derived from small businesses 
because workers compensation premium rates are calculated  in general  as a percentage of a policyholder s payroll expense  premiums fluctuate depending upon the level of business activity and number of employees of our policyholders 
because of their size  small businesses may be more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions 
we believe that the most common reason for policyholder non renewals is business failure 
as a result  our workers compensation gross premiums written are primarily dependent upon economic conditions where our policyholders operate 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business 
our business is dependent upon the uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunication systems 
we rely upon our systems  as well as the systems of our vendors  to underwrite and process our business  make claim payments  provide customer service  provide policy administration services  such as endorsements  cancellations and premium collections  comply with insurance regulatory requirements and perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to timely and efficiently process our business and protect our information and telecommunications systems from physical loss  telecommunications failure or other similar catastrophic events  as well as from security breaches 
while we have implemented business contingency plans and other reasonable and appropriate internal controls to protect our systems from interruption  loss or 
table of contents security breaches  a sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to process our business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 
likewise  a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation in the event confidential customer information is disclosed to third parties 
either of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  operations or reputation 
our specialty risk and extended warranty business is dependent upon the sale of products covered by warranties and service contracts which we cannot control 
our specialty risk and extended warranty segment primarily covers manufacturers  service providers and retailers for the cost of performing their obligations under extended warranties and service contracts provided in connection with the sale or lease of various types of consumer electronics  automobiles  light and heavy construction equipment and other consumer and commercial products 
thus  any decrease in the sale or leasing of these products  whether due to economic factors or otherwise  is likely to have an adverse impact upon our specialty risk and extended warranty business 
we cannot influence materially the success of our specialty risk clients primary product sales and leasing efforts 
state insurance regulators may require the restructuring of the warranty or service contract business of certain policyholders that purchase our specialty risk products and this may adversely affect our specialty risk business 
some of the largest purchasers of our specialty risk insurance products in the united states are manufacturers  service providers and retailers that issue extended warranties or service contracts for consumer and commercial grade goods  including coverage against accidental damage to the goods covered by the warranty or service contract 
we insure these policyholders against the cost of repairing or replacing such goods in the event of such accidental damage 
state insurance regulators may take the position that certain of the extended warranties or service contracts issued by our policyholders constitute insurance contracts that may only be issued by licensed insurance companies 
in that event  the extended warranty or service contract business of our policyholders may have to be restructured  which could adversely affect our specialty risk and extended warranty business 
our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control  which may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile 
the revenues and results of operations of insurance companies historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
our profitability can be affected significantly by rising levels of claims costs  including medical and prescription drug costs  that we cannot anticipate at the time we establish our premium rates  fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment that affect returns on invested assets  changes in the frequency or severity of claims  the financial stability of our third party reinsurers  changes in the level of reinsurance capacity  termination of reinsurance agreements and changes in our capital capacity  new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of liabilities of insurance companies  volatile and unpredictable developments  including man made  weather related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks  price competition  inadequate reserves  downgrades in the am best rating of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries  cyclical nature of the property and casualty insurance market  negative developments in the specialty property and casualty insurance sectors in which we operate  and 
table of contents reduction in the business activities of our policyholders 
if our revenues and results of operations fluctuate as a result of one or more of these factors  the price of our common stock may be volatile 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and may lack the financial resources to compete effectively 
we compete with other insurance companies  and many of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger and possess greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
in our small commercial business segment  we also compete with individual self insured companies  state insurance pools and self insurance funds 
we compete on the basis of many factors  including coverage availability  responsiveness to the needs of our independent producers  claims management  payment settlement terms  premium rates  policy terms  types of insurance offered  overall financial strength  financial ratings and reputation 
if any of our competitors offer premium rates  policy terms or types of insurance which were more competitive than ours  we could lose market share 
there is no assurance that we will maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we currently operate or that we will establish a competitive position in new markets into which we may expand 
if we cannot sustain our business relationships  including our relationships with independent agencies and third party warranty administrators  we may be unable to operate profitably 
our business relationships are generally governed by agreements with agents and warranty administrators that may be terminated on short notice 
we market our small commercial insurance primarily through independent wholesale and retail agencies 
except in connection with certain acquisitions  independent agencies generally are not obligated to promote our products and may sell insurance offered by our competitors 
as a result  our continued profitability depends  in part  on the marketing efforts of our independent agencies and on our ability to offer property and casualty insurance and maintain financial strength ratings that meet the requirements and preferences of our independent agencies and their policyholders 
fifteen independent producers and policyholders account for the vast majority of our specialty risk and extended warranty business 
as a result  the profitability of this segment of our business depends  in part  on our ability to retain these accounts  which cannot be assured 
in the specialty middle market business segment  independent wholesale agents produce and largely control the renewal of all the business 
our ability to successfully and profitably transition this business depends on  among other things  our ability to establish and maintain good relationships with these producers 
an inability to effectively manage the growth of our operations could make it difficult for us to compete and affect our ability to operate profitably 
our continuing growth strategy includes expanding in our existing markets  opportunistically acquiring books of business  other insurance companies or producers  entering new geographic markets and further developing our relationships with independent agencies and extended warranty service contract administrators 
our growth strategy is subject to various risks  including risks associated with our ability to identify profitable new geographic markets for entry  attract and retain qualified personnel for expanded operations  identify  recruit and integrate new independent agencies and extended warranty service contract administrators  identify potential acquisition targets and successfully acquire them  expand existing agency relationships  and augment our internal monitoring and control systems as we expand our business 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of 
table of contents claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under an insurance policy may not be known until many years after the policy is issued 
for example  medical costs associated with permanent and partial disabilities may increase more rapidly or be higher than we currently expect 
changes of this nature may expose us to higher workers compensation claims than we anticipated when we wrote the underlying policy 
unexpected increases in our claim costs many years after workers compensation policies are issued may also result in our inability to recover from certain of our reinsurers the full amount that they would otherwise owe us for such claims costs because certain of the reinsurance agreements covering our workers compensation business include commutation clauses which permit the reinsurers to terminate their obligations by making a final payment to us based on an estimate of their remaining liabilities 
additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may be available to us only on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including regulatory requirements  the financial stability of our reinsurers  future acquisitions and our ability to write new business and establish premium rates sufficient to cover our estimated claims 
we may need to raise additional capital or curtail our growth to support future operating requirements or cover claims 
if we have to raise additional capital  equity or debt financing may not be available to us or may be available only on terms that are not favorable 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our stockholders could result and the securities sold may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our currently issued and outstanding common stock 
in addition  under certain circumstances  we may sell our common stock  or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock  at a price per share less than the market value of our common stock 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and  as a result  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
our businesses  and  therefore  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the recent disruption in the global credit markets and instability of financial systems 
the recent disruption in the us based credit markets  the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets had a significant impact on financial institutions and certain insurance companies  which has resulted in significant losses  greater volatility  significantly less liquidity  widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets 
these conditions resulted in the failure of a number of financial institutions and unprecedented action by governmental authorities and central banks around the world  including investing in or lending money to financial institutions and insurance companies which were perceived to need additional capital 
these unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and access to capital and credit for many companies remains limited 
although we are not currently aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders to honor their commitments to extend us credit  the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility  which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures 
continued adverse conditions in the credit markets could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 
if we were unable to realize our investment objectives  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
investment income is an important component of our net income 
we primarily manage our investment portfolio internally under investment guidelines approved by our board of directors and the boards of directors of our subsidiaries 
although these guidelines stress diversification and capital preservation  our investments are subject to a variety of risks  including risks related to general economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  market volatility  various regulatory issues  credit risk  potential litigation  tax audits and disputes  failure to monetize in an effective and or cost efficient manner and poor operating results 
general economic conditions may be adversely affected by us involvement in hostilities with other countries and large scale acts of terrorism  or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts 

table of contents we invest a portion of our portfolio in below investment grade securities 
the risk of default by borrowers that issue below investment grade securities is significantly greater than that of other borrowers because these borrowers are often highly leveraged and more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  including a recession 
in addition  these securities are generally unsecured and often subordinated to other debt 
the risk that we may not be able to recover our investment in below investment grade securities is higher than with investment grade securities 
these and other factors affect the capital markets and  consequently  the value of our investment portfolio and our investment income 
any significant decline in our investment income would adversely affect our revenues and net income and  as a result  decrease our surplus and stockholders equity 
a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations 
our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities 
as of december   our investment in fixed income securities was approximately billion  or of our total investment portfolio 
the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
the fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest rates rise 
conversely  if interest rates decline  investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower 
in addition  some fixed income securities  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately million 
the value of investments in fixed income securities  and particularly our investments in high yield securities  is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer or increases in market interest rates 
although we attempt to manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal  our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest  as well as risks inherent in particular securities 
these conditions could result in lower than expected yields on our fixed securities and short term investment portfolio 
while we attempt to manage these risks through investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms  our efforts may not be successful 
to a large degree  the credit risk we face is a function of the economy  accordingly  we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession 
as a result  our exposure to any of the above credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we invest some of our assets in equity securities  which may decline in value 
we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities 
at december   our investments in equity securities were approximately million  or approximately two percent of our investment portfolio 
we reported unrealized losses at year end in the amounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the united states 
we conduct business outside the united states primarily in the united kingdom  bermuda  canada and ireland 
we have also started to explore opportunities in other countries  including in emerging markets such as india and china 
while our business outside of the united states currently constitutes approximately percent our gross written premium  in conducting such business we are subject to a number of significant risks  particularly in emerging economies 
these risks include restrictions such as price controls  capital controls  exchange controls and other restrictive government actions  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation 
in addition  some countries  particularly emerging economies  have laws and regulations that lack clarity and  even with local expertise and effective controls  it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements of the local laws 
failure to comply with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally 

table of contents our operating results may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our net premiums written were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of both december  and  approximately of our cash and investments were denominated in non us currencies 
because we write business in the eu and the united kingdom  we hold investments denominated in euros and british pounds and may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non us currencies  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we may be subject to taxes on our luxembourg affiliates equalization reserves 
in  we acquired a luxembourg holding company and five luxembourg domiciled captive insurance companies with equalization reserves in the total amount of approximately million 
an equalization reserve is a catastrophe reserve in excess of required reserves determined by a formula based on the volatility of the business ceded to the captive insurance company 
provided that the company is able to cede losses to the captive insurance companies through intercompany reinsurance arrangements  which are sufficient to exhaust the captives equalization reserves  luxembourg would not  under laws currently in effect  impose any income  corporation or profits tax on the captive insurance companies 
however  if the captive reinsurance companies were to cease reinsuring business without exhausting the equalization reserves  they would recognize income which would be taxed by luxembourg at a rate of approximately 
our business is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers 
our success is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers because of their industry expertise  knowledge of our markets and relationships with our independent agencies and warranty administrators 
our principal executive officers are barry d 
zyskind  ronald e 
pipoly  jr  michael saxon  christopher longo and max caviet 
we have entered into employment agreements with all of our principal executive officers 
should any of our other executive officers cease working for us  we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the workers compensation insurance industry and or the specialty risk sectors that we target  and our business may be adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or other employees 
our business is dependent upon third party service providers 
we use third party claims administrators and other outside companies to underwrite policies and manage claims on our behalf for some portions of our business  including our specialty risk and extended warranty segment and our specialty middle market business segment 
we are dependent on the skills and performance of these parties  and we cannot control their actions although we provide underwriting guidelines and periodically audit their performance 
in addition  the loss of the services of key outside service providers could adversely impact our business prospects and operations 
the loss of the services of these providers  or our inability to contract and retain other skilled service providers from a limited pool of qualified insurance service providers  could delay or prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy or could otherwise adversely affect the company 
amtrust is an insurance holding company and does not have any direct operations 
amtrust is a holding company that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries 
amtrust s primary assets are the capital stock of these operating subsidiaries 
payments from our insurance company subsidiaries pursuant to management agreements and tax sharing agreements are our primary source of funds to pay amtrust s direct expenses 
we anticipate that such payments  together with dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries  will continue to be the primary source of funds for amtrust 
the ability of amtrust to pay dividends to our stockholders largely depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to amtrust 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by insurance laws of various states  ireland  england and bermuda  and the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  and could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future  including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the 
table of contents future 
as a result  at times  amtrust may not be able to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries and may not receive dividends in amounts necessary to pay dividends on our capital stock 
as of december  amtrust s insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends to amtrust of million without prior regulatory approval 
any dividends paid by amtrust s subsidiaries would reduce their surplus 
assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds  second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability 
most states require insurance companies licensed to do business in their state to participate in guaranty funds  which require the insurance companies to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
these obligations are funded by assessments  which are expected to continue in the future 
state guaranty associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurance companies in the state based on their proportionate share of premiums written in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies are engaged 
accordingly  the assessments levied on us may increase as we increase our premiums written 
some states also have laws that establish second injury funds to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
these funds are supported by either assessments or premium surcharges based on paid losses 
the effect of assessments and premium surcharges or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business 
in addition  as a condition to conducting workers compensation and commercial automobile liability business in most states  insurance companies are required to participate in residual market programs to provide insurance to those businesses who cannot procure coverage from an insurance carrier willing to provide coverage on a voluntary basis 
insurance companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by  among other things  participating in a reinsurance pool where the results of all policies provided through the pool are shared by the participating insurance companies 
although we are compensated for our participation in these pools by receiving a share of the premium paid to the pools  this compensation is often inadequate to cover the cost of our losses arising from our participation in these pools 
accordingly  mandatory pooling arrangements may cause a decrease in our profits 
we currently participate in mandatory pooling arrangements in states 
our premiums from mandatory pooling arrangements were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these mandatory pooling arrangements caused our net combined ratio to decrease by for and increase by for and  respectively 
as we write policies in new states that have mandatory pooling arrangements  we will be required to participate in additional pooling arrangements 
further  the impairment  insolvency or failure of other insurance companies in these pooling arrangements would likely increase the liability of other members in the pool 
we are subject to regulation and legislative and regulatory proposals which may limit our ability to transact business 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which they do business 
insurance regulation generally is intended to protect policyholders  not shareholders 
in the united states  insurance regulation generally is administered by each state through its state insurance department 
state insurance regulation regulates  among other things solvency  the lines of business which we may transact  certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and affiliates  including us  the nature  quality and concentration of our investments  rates which we may charge and the terms and conditions of our policy forms  dividends which may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries  in addition to state regulation  legislative proposals in the us congress may lead to additional federal regulation in coming years 
our non us subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
in the event that a regulatory authority determines that we have failed to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to our business  we could be subject to actions which could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on our business  such as fines  penalties or orders to cease transacting business 
furthermore  the enactment of new laws and regulations and changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations which are not yet contemplated could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our european legal entities will be subject to solvency ii  the new eu regulatory regime  which was enacted in november  and imposes new solvency and governance requirements on insurers across all eu member states 
solvency ii is expected to be implemented in october regulators in bermuda and other jurisdictions in which we operate are also considering various proposals for financial and regulatory reform 
the future impact of such initiatives  if any  on our results of operations or our financial condition cannot be determined at this time 
we are unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted  or the effect  if any  these developments would have on our operations and financial condition 
we may have exposure to losses from terrorism for which we are required by law to provide coverage regarding such losses 
us insurers are required by state and federal law to offer coverage for terrorism in certain commercial lines  including workers compensation 
in response to the september  terrorist attacks  the united states congress enacted legislation designed to ensure  among other things  the availability of insurance coverage for foreign terrorist acts  including the requirement that insurers offer such coverage in certain commercial lines 
the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  the terrorism risk insurance extension act of triea and the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of tripra require commercial property and casualty insurance companies to offer coverage for certain acts of terrorism and established a federal assistance program through the end of to help such insurers cover claims related to future terrorism related losses 
pursuant to tria  amtrust s insurance companies must offer insureds coverage for acts of terrorism that are certified as such by the us secretary of the treasury  in concurrence with the secretary of state and the attorney general  for an additional premium or decline such coverage 
under tria and tripra  the program s protection is not triggered for losses arising from an act of terrorism until the industry first suffers losses of million in the aggregate during any one year 
once the program trigger is met  the federal government will reimburse commercial insurers for up to of the losses due to certified acts of terrorism in excess of a deductible of the insurer s direct earned commercial lines premiums for the immediately preceding calendar year 
we estimate that our deductible would be approximately million 
because there are substantial limitations and restrictions on the protection against terrorism losses provided to us by our reinsurance and the risk of severe losses to us from acts of terrorism remains 
accordingly  events constituting acts of terrorism may not be covered by  or may exceed the capacity of  our reinsurance and tria protections and could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we reinsure a portion of the risk we retain under the program in the cumulative amount of million in excess of million per occurrence 
however  our terrorism reinsurance does not provide coverage for an act stemming from nuclear  biological or chemical terrorism 
the impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature  extent  location and timing of such an act 
our policies providing specialty risk and extended warranty coverage are not intended to provide coverage for losses arising from acts of terrorism 
accordingly  we have not obtained reinsurance for terrorism losses nor taken any steps to preserve our rights to the benefits of the tria program for this line of business and would not be entitled to recover from our reinsurers or the tria program if we were required to pay any terrorism losses under our specialty risk and extended warranty segment 
because there have been no claims filed under the tria program as yet  there is still a great deal of uncertainty over the way in which the federal government will implement the rules governing such claims 
however  it is possible that the fact that we have not taken steps to preserve our right to the benefits of the tria program for the us portion of our specialty risk and extended warranty segment may adversely affect our ability to collect under the program generally 

table of contents the federal terrorism risk assistance provided by tria  triea and tripra will expire at the end of  there is no guaranty that terrorism insurance will be readily available or affordable before or after such 
as a result of the above  there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the extent and adequacy of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of future terrorist attacks 
any future renewal by congress may be on substantially less favorable terms 
aii may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march  the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  of bermuda  has given aii an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to aii or any of its operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  see business certain international tax considerations 
given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that aii will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march  in the event that aii becomes subject to any bermuda tax after such date  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the effects of the increasing amount of litigation against insurers on our business are uncertain 
although we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our customers  other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation  some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts  and the outcomes of which are unpredictable 
this litigation is based on a variety of issues including insurance and claim settlement practices 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such litigation in the future 
changes in accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles  which are periodically revised  interpreted and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations  or could be subject to existing guidance as we enter into new transactions  which may have a material adverse effect on our results or operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected 
for a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and  if known  our estimates of their expected impact  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
risks related to our common stock our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control  which many cause the price of our shares to be volatile 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol afsi 
however  the market price for shares of our common stock may be highly volatile 
our performance  as well as government or regulatory action  tax laws  interest rates and general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations  changes on our earnings estimates or publications of research reports about us or the industry  increase in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of common stock to demand a higher yield  changes in market valuations of other insurance companies  adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future  additions or departures of key personnel  reaction to the sale or purchase of company stock by our principal stockholders or our executive officers

our principal stockholders have the ability to control our business which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders 
based on the number of shares outstanding as of december   george karfunkel  michael karfunkel and barry d 
zyskind  directly or indirectly  collectively own or control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors  amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  any proposed merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions including related party transactions 
these stockholders may have interests that are different from other stockholders 
in addition  we are a controlled company as defined in nasd rule c 
at present  half of the members of our board of directors are independent 
as a controlled company  each of our board committees  except our audit committee  may include non independent directors 
the audit committee independence requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of apply to us  and we have organized our audit committee to meet these requirements 
if we were to cease being a controlled company as a result of issuance of common stock by us or sales of common stock by george karfunkel  michael karfunkel or barry d 
zyskind  we would have to comply with the board committee independence requirements of the nasdaq stock market within specified periods  which would involve having an entirely independent compensation and governance and nominating committees within one year after ceasing to be a controlled company 
if we are unable to achieve compliance with these requirements  our common stock could be de listed from the nasdaq stock market 
in addition  george karfunkel and michael karfunkel through entities which each of them control have entered into transactions with us and may from time to time in the future enter into other transactions with us 
as a result  these individuals may have interests that are different from  or in addition to  their interest as stockholders in our company 
such transactions may adversely affect our results or operations or financial condition 
our officers  directors and principal stockholders could delay or prevent an acquisition or merger of our company even if the transaction would benefit other stockholders 
moreover  this concentration of share ownership makes it impossible for other stockholders to replace directors and management without the consent of the controlling stockholders 
in addition  this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the price prospective buyers are willing to pay for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 
applicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
we are subject to state and foreign statutes and regulations  which generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of any of our insurance company subsidiaries obtain prior regulatory approval 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

aii a excellent reinsurance for consolidated subsidiaries united states and european union bermuda insurance  particularly workers compensation  is  generally  affected by seasonality 
the first quarter generally produces greater premiums than subsequent quarters 
nevertheless  the impact of seasonality on our small commercial business and specialty middle market business segments has not been significant 
we believe that this is because we serve many small businesses in different geographic locations 
in addition  we believe seasonality may be muted by our acquisition activity 
one of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance is return on average equity 
our return on average equity was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our overall financial objective is to produce a return on average equity of or more over the long term 
in addition  we target a net combined ratio of or lower over the long term  while seeking to maintain optimal operating leverage in our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our am best rating objectives 
our net combined ratio was  and for the years ended 
table of contents december   and  respectively 
a key factor in achieving our targeted net combined ratio is improvement of our net expense ratio 
our strategy across our segments is to maintain premium rates  deploy capital judiciously  manage our expenses and focus on the sectors in which we have expertise  which we believe should provide opportunities for greater returns 
investment income is an important part of our business 
because the period of time between our receipt of premiums and the ultimate settlement of claims is often several years or longer  we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time 
as a result  we expect to generate more investment income from our premiums as compared to insurance companies that operate in many other lines of business 
our net investment income was million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the company held and of total invested assets in cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  respectively 
this relatively high concentration of cash and cash equivalents represents our reaction to the relatively flat debt yield curve and should enable the company to quickly redeploy substantial assets should the interest rate environment change 
our most significant balance sheet liability is our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid are not discounted using present value factors 
our loss reserves are reviewed at least annually by our external actuaries 
reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances 
the interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces  principally frequency and severity of future claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  inflation of medical costs and wages  insurance policy coverage interpretations  jury determinations and legislative changes 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
if we change our estimates  these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made  with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings

table of contents principal revenue and expense items gross written premium 
gross written premium represents estimated premiums from each insurance policy that we write  including as part of an assigned risk plan  during a reporting period based on the effective date of the individual policy 
certain policies that are underwritten by the company are subject to premium audit at that policy s cancellation or expiration 
the final actual gross premiums written may vary from the original estimate based on changes to the final rating parameters or classifications of the policy 
net written premium 
net written premium are gross premiums written less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements 
the amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement 
net earned premium 
net earned premium is the earned portion of our net premiums written 
insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy 
at the end of each reporting period  premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy 
our workers compensation insurance policies typically have a term of one year 
thus  for a one year policy written on july  for an employer with a constant payroll during the term of the policy  we would earn half of the premiums in and the other half in our specialty risk and extended warranty coverages are earned over the estimated exposure time period 
the terms vary depending on the risk and have an average duration of approximately months  but range in duration from one month to months 
ceding commission revenues 
commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies  generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured 
net investment income and realized gains and losses 
we invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities primarily in cash and cash equivalents  fixed maturity and equity securities 
our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets 
net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable 
net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable  or are written down as a result of other than temporary impairment 
we classify equity securities and our fixed maturity securities as available for sale 
net unrealized gains losses on those securities classified as available for sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
service and fee income 
we recognize service and fee revenue as a servicing carrier for the arkansas  indiana  illinois  georgia and virginia assigned risk plans 
in addition  we also offer claims adjusting and loss control services for fees to unaffiliated third parties 
we also recognize fee income associated with the issuance of workers compensation policies for installment fees  in jurisdictions where it is permitted and approved  and reinstatement fees  fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non payment  in jurisdictions where it is permitted and approved 
our specialty risk and extended warranty business generates fee revenue for product warranty registration and claims handling services provided to unaffiliated third parties 
we also recognize certain brokerage  and asset management fees in association with our reinsurance agreement with maiden 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we began recognizing certain consulting and information technology consulting fees in accordance with agreements with american capital acquisition corporation acac 
loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
loss and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred represent our largest expense item and  for any given reporting period  include estimates of future claim payments  changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and servicing claims 
these expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure 
we record loss and loss adjustment expenses related to estimates of future claim payments based on case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience 
it is typical for our more serious bodily injury claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of 
table of contents injured employees and claimants and the costs of their medical treatment 
our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability 
acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses consist of policy acquisition expenses  salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses 
these items are described below policy acquisition expenses comprise commissions directly attributable to those agents  wholesalers or brokers that produce premiums written on our behalf 
in most instances  commissions are paid based on collected premium  which reduces our credit risk exposure associated with producers in case a policyholder does not pay a premium 
we pay state and local taxes  licenses and fees  assessments and contributions to various state workers compensation guaranty funds based on our premiums or losses in each state 
surcharges that the company may be required to charge insureds in certain jurisdictions are considered accrued liabilities  rather than expense 
salaries and benefits expenses are those salaries and benefits expenses for employees that are directly involved in the origination  issuance and maintenance of policies  claims adjustment and accounting for insurance transactions 
salaries and benefits associated with employees that are involved in fee generating activities are classified as other expenses 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of other costs associated with the company s insurance activities such as federal excise tax  postage  telephones and internet access charges as well as legal and auditing fees and board and bureau charges 
other 
other expenses include those charges that are related to the amortization of tangible and intangible assets and non insurance fee generating activities in which the company engages  including salaries and benefits expenses and other charges directly attributable to non insurance fee generating activities 
interest expense 
interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then applicable interest rates 
income tax expense 
we incur federal income tax expense as well as income tax expense in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
net loss ratio 
the net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of net losses and lae incurred to net premiums earned 
net expense ratio 
the net expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company s operational efficiency in administering its business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue to net premiums earned 
net combined ratio 
the net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company s overall underwriting profit 
this is the sum of the net loss and net expense ratios 
if the net combined ratio is at or above percent  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
net premiums earned less expenses included in combined ratio underwriting income 
underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income  interest expense and income taxes 
return on equity 
return on equity is calculated by dividing net income net income excludes results of discontinued operations as well as any currency gain or loss associated with discontinued operations on an after tax basis by the average of shareholders equity 

table of contents critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
these policies require us to make estimates and assumptions 
the company s management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates and assumptions used with the audit committee of the board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results in future periods might differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers  assessments  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  the impairment of investment securities  goodwill and other intangible assets and the valuation of stock based compensation 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies 
premiums 
insurance premiums  other than specialty risk and extended warranty  are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the contract period 
insurance premiums on specialty risk and extended warranty are earned based on estimated program coverage periods 
these estimates are based on the expected distribution of coverage periods by contract at inception  because a single contract may contain multiple coverage period options and these estimates are revised based on the actual coverage periods selected by the insured 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired term of the contract or policy in force 
premium adjustments on contracts and audit premiums are based on estimates made over the contract period 
the company also estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of premium 
the company reviews its bad debt write offs at least annually and adjusts its premium percentage as required 
allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
ceding commission revenue 
commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies  generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured 
certain reinsurance agreements contain provisions whereby the ceding commission rates vary based on the loss experience under the agreements 
the company records ceding commission revenue based on its current estimate of subject losses 
the company records adjustments to the ceding commission revenue in the period that changes in the estimated losses are determined 
reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves  we do not use loss discounting  which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we utilize a combination of the company s incurred loss development factors and industry wide incurred loss development factors 
our actuary generates a range within which it is reasonably likely that our ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses for claims incurred in a particular time period  typically the calendar year  will fall 
the low end of the range is established by assigning a weight of to our ultimate losses obtained by application of the company s own loss development factors 
the high end is established by assigning a weight of each to our ultimate losses as developed through application of company and through application of industry wide loss development factors 
the determination to assign particular weights to ultimate losses developed through application of company loss development factors and industry wide loss development factors is made by our actuary and is a matter of actuarial judgment 
in the selection of our reserves  the company has given greater consideration over time to the results attributable to its own loss development factors 

table of contents we believe this method  by which we track the development of claims incurred in a particular time period  is the best method for projecting our ultimate liability 
loss development factors are dependent on a number of elements  including frequency and severity of claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  projected inflation of medical costs and wages for workers compensation  insurance policy coverage interpretations  judicial determinations and existing laws and regulations 
the predictive ability of loss development factors is dependent on consistent underwriting  claims handling  and inflation  among other factors  and predictable legislatively and judicially imposed legal requirements 
if all things remain equal  losses incurred in should develop similarly to losses incurred in and prior years 
thus  if the net loss ratio for premiums written in year one is we expect that the net loss ratio for premiums written in year two also would be 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty in the loss development factors  our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original estimates 
notwithstanding the inherent uncertainty  the company has not experienced material variability in its loss development factors 
we believe that it is reasonably likely that we could experience a deviation in our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves due to changes in the elements that underlie loss development  such as claims frequency or severity 
for example  as of december   the average cost per workers compensation claim was  which was a increase over the claims severity from of  in  claims frequency number of claims per million of payroll increased to from  an increase of  for the period between and in the event of a increase in claims frequency as measured by payroll  which we believe is the most important assumption regarding our business  the company s loss reserves as of december  would be understated by million and would result in an after tax reduction in shareholders equity of million 
in the event of a increase in claim severity  which is the average incurred loss per claim  the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be understated by million and would result in an after tax reduction in shareholders equity of million 
on a quarterly basis  and in some cases more frequently  we review our reserves to determine whether they are consistent with our actual results 
in the event of a discrepancy  we would seek to determine the causes underwriting  claims  inflation  regulatory and would adjust our reserves accordingly 
for example  if the development of our total incurred losses were greater than the loss development factors would have predicted  we would adjust our reserves for the periods in question 
in  we recognized a million deficiency in prior year s reserves  related to our mandatory participation in the reinsurance pools which reinsure state assigned risk plans for workers compensation insurance 
in  we recognized a million redundancy 
in  the company s liabilities for unpaid losses and lae attributable to prior years decreased by million as result of favorable development in the small commercial business segment  partially offset by unfavorable development from the company s involuntary participation in ncci pools 
we do not anticipate that we will make any material reserve adjustments  but will continue to monitor the accuracy of our loss development factors and adequacy of our reserves 
additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses can be found in risk factors and business loss reserves 
reinsurance 
reinsurance premiums  losses and lae are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums earned and losses incurred ceded to other companies have been recorded as reductions of premium revenue and losses and lae 
commissions allowed by reinsurers on business ceded have been accounted for as ceding commission revenue 
reinsurance recoverables relate to the portion of reserves and paid losses and lae that are ceded to other companies 
the company remains contingently liable for all loss payments  in the event of failure to collect from the reinsurer 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
we defer commission expenses  premium taxes and assessments as well as certain marketing  sales  underwriting and safety costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance policies 
these acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense ratably as premiums are earned 
the company may realize deferred policy acquisition costs only if the ratio of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves calculated on a discounted basis to the premiums to be earned is less than 
table of contents  as it historically has been 
if  hypothetically  that ratio were to be above  the company could not continue to record deferred policy acquisition costs as an asset and may be required to establish a liability for a premium deficiency reserve 
assessments related to insurance premiums 
we are subject to various assessments and premium surcharges related to our insurance activities  including assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds and second injury funds 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written 
assessments based on losses are generally paid within one year of when claims are paid by us 
state guaranty fund assessments are used by state insurance regulatory agencies to pay claims of policyholders of impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies and the operating expenses of those agencies 
second injury funds are used by states to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
in some states  these assessments and premium surcharges may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes 
earned but unbilled premium 
earned but unbilled premium ebub estimates the amount of audit premium for those policies that have yet to be audited as of the date of the quarter or year end 
workers compensation policies are subject to audit and the final premium may increase or decrease materially from the original premium due to revisions to actual payroll and or employee classification 
based on guidance in fasb asc prior authoritative literature statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises as well as statement of statutory accounting principles ssap  the company determines ebub using statistically supported aggregate calculations based on the company s historical premium audit results 
the company has not had a material adjustment as a result of actual premium audits materially differing from the estimates used in calculating ebub 
as of december   if the actual results of the future premiums audits were lower than the historical results used in calculating ebub  the result would be a decrease in ebub and net earned premium of million or million after tax 
if the actual results of the future premiums audits were higher than the historical results used in calculating ebub  the result would be an increase in ebub  and net earned premium of million or million after tax 
in calculating ebub  the company considers its ability to collect the projected increased premium as well as those expenses associated with both the additional premium and return premium 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are presented at cost  which approximates fair value 
the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
the company maintains its cash balances at several financial institutions 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic secures accounts up to  at these institutions 
management monitors balances in excess of insured limits and believes they do not represent a significant credit risk to the company 
investments 
the company accounts for its investments in accordance with asc debt and equity securities  which requires that fixed maturity and equity securities that have readily determined fair values be segregated into categories based upon the company s intention for those securities 
in accordance with asc  the company has classified its fixed maturity securities and equity securities as available for sale 
the company may sell its available for sale securities in response to changes in interest rates  risk reward characteristics  liquidity needs or other factors 
fixed maturity securities and equity securities are reported at their estimated fair values based on quoted market prices or a recognized pricing service  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax effects  reported as a separate component of comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification of the investments sold 

table of contents quarterly  the company s investment committee committee evaluates each security which has an unrealized loss as of the end of the subject reporting period for other than temporary impairment otti 
the committee uses a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
some of the criteria the company considers include the current fair value compared to amortized cost  the length of time the security s fair value has been below its amortized cost  specific credit issues related to the issuer such as changes in credit rating  reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments  whether management intends to sell the security and  if not  whether it is not more than likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  and the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation or the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy laws 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
the company writes down investments immediately which it considers to be impaired based on the above criteria collectively 
the investment committee maintains an individual list of investments that have been in a significant unrealized loss position in excess of months for review of possible impairment 
absent any of the above criteria  the company generally considers an investment to be impaired when it has been in a significant unrealized loss position for over months 
based on guidance in fasb asc prior authoritative literature fsp recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  in the event of the decline in fair value of a debt security  a holder of that security that does not intend to sell the debt security and for whom it is not more than likely than not that such holder will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  is required to separate the decline in fair value into a the amount representing the credit loss and b the amount related to other factors 
the amount of total decline in fair value related to the credit loss shall be recognized in earnings as an otti with the amount related to other factors recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss net loss  net of tax 
otti credit losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
the determination of otti is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of the loss realization 
during  and  the company recorded impairment write downs of million  million and million  respectively after determining that certain of its investments were otti 
goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc  business combinations and asc intangibles goodwill and other 
a purchase price paid that is in excess of net assets goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as an asset  and is not amortized 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the goodwill or intangible asset is impaired  it is written down to its realizable value with a corresponding expense reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes the company joins its domestic subsidiaries in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return and is party to federal income tax allocation agreements 
under the tax allocation agreements  the company pays to or receives from its subsidiaries the amount  if any  by which the group s federal income tax liability was affected by virtue of inclusion of the subsidiary in the consolidated federal return 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the deferred tax asset primarily consists of book versus tax differences for premiums earned  loss and loss adjustment expense reserve discounting  policy acquisition costs  earned but unbilled premiums  and unrealized 
table of contents holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities 
changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income  primarily unrealized investment gains and losses and foreign currency translation gains and losses  are recorded directly to other comprehensive income 
otherwise  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense 
in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized

the committee uses a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
some of the criteria the company considers include the current fair value compared to amortized cost  the length of time the security s fair value has been below its amortized cost  specific credit issues related to the issuer such as changes in credit rating  reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments  whether management intends to sell the security and  if not  whether it is not more than likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  and the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation or the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy laws 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
the company writes down investments immediately which it considers to be impaired based on the above criteria collectively 
the investment committee maintains an individual list of investments that have been in a significant unrealized loss position in excess of months for review of possible impairment 
absent any of the above criteria  the company generally considers an investment to be impaired when it has been in a significant unrealized loss position for over months 

table of contents during the year ended december   based on the criteria above  we determined that eleven equity securities and two fixed maturity securities were other than temporarily impaired

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period in the table above are based upon the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns and are not contractual liabilities as to a time certain 
our contractual liability is to provide benefits under the policy 
as a result  our calculation of loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of loss and loss adjustment expenses generally and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our loss and loss adjustment expense estimate process  see business loss reserves 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the table above to the extent that current estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see risk factors risks related to our business our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we are subject to various annual assessments imposed by certain of the states in which we write insurance policies 
these assessments are generally based upon the amount of premiums written or losses paid during the applicable year 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written  while assessments based on losses are generally paid within one year after the loss is paid 
when we establish a reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses for a reported claim  we accrue our obligation to pay any applicable assessments 
if settlement of the claim is to be paid out over more than one year  our obligation to pay any related loss based assessments extends for the same period of time 
because our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates  our accruals for loss based insurance assessments are also based on estimates 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ  perhaps materially  from our reserves 
accordingly  our actual loss based insurance assessments may vary  perhaps materially  from our accruals 
we are required by the terms of certain purchase agreements to pay the seller an annual minimum override payment based on a contractually defined formula 
the amount payable to the seller under these agreements could be materially higher if the premiums produced generate a higher payment than the calculated minimum payment 
the interest related to the debt by period is as follows million less than year  million years  million years and million more than years 
in addition included within debt and interest is million related to the maiden collateral loan and million of associated interest 
inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before we know the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts 
we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves  especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates 
table of contents where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation 
inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated  which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including salaries and benefits  generally are impacted by inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are liquidity risk  credit risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and equity price risk 
liquidity risk 
liquidity risk represents the potential inability of the company to meet all payment obligations when they become due 
the company maintains sufficient cash and marketable securities to fund claim payments and operations 
we purchase reinsurance coverage to mitigate the risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency from catastrophic events or a single large loss 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
credit risk 
credit risk is the potential loss arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our fixed maturity securities and the financial condition of our third party reinsurers 
we address the credit risk related to the issuers of our fixed maturity securities by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities that are rated bbb or higher by standard poor s 
we also independently monitor the financial condition of all issuers of our fixed maturity securities 
to limit our risk exposure  we employ diversification policies that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although our third party reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have ceded 
as a result  reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims covered under the insurance policies we issue and we might not collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers 
we address this credit risk by selecting reinsurers which have an am best rating of a excellent or better at the time we enter into the agreement and by performing  along with our reinsurance broker  periodic credit reviews of our reinsurers 
if one of our reinsurers suffers a credit downgrade  we may consider various options to lessen the risk of asset impairment  including commutation  novation and letters of credit

interest rate risk 
we had fixed maturity securities excluding million of time and short term deposits with a fair value of  million and a carrying value of  million as of december  that are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of our fixed maturity securities 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset and liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixed maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities as of december  to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  and the associated impact on our stockholders equity 
because we anticipate that the company will continue to meet its obligations out of income  we classify a portion of our fixed maturity securities  other than redeemable preferred stock  mortgage backed and corporate obligations  as held to maturity and carry them on our balance sheet at cost or amortized cost  as applicable 
any redeemable preferred stock we hold from time to time is classified as available for sale and carried on our balance sheet at fair value 
temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities that are held to maturity  such as those resulting from interest rate fluctuations  do not impact the carrying value of these securities and  therefore  do not affect our shareholders equity 
however  temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities that are held as available for sale do impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income  net of

the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities and on our shareholders equity  each as of december

a fluctuation of basis points in interest on our variable rate debt instruments  which are tied to libor  would affect our earnings and cash flows by million before income tax  on an annual basis  but would not affect the fair market value of the variable rate debt 
foreign currency risk 
we write insurance in the united kingdom and certain other european union member countries through aiu 
while the functional currency of aiu is the euro  we write coverages that are settled in local currencies  including the british pound 
we attempt to maintain sufficient local currency assets on deposit to minimize our exposure to realized currency losses 
assuming a increase in the exchange rate of the local currency in which the claims will be paid and that we do not hold that local currency  we would recognize a million before tax realized currency loss based on our outstanding foreign denominated reserves of million at december  equity price risk 
equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio  which include common stocks  non redeemable preferred stocks and master limited partnerships 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of our equity securities result in a decrease in the value of our total assets and a decrease in our shareholders equity 
as of december   the equity securities in our investment portfolio had a fair value of million  representing approximately two percent of our total invested assets on that date 
we are fundamental long buyers and short sellers  with a focus on value oriented stocks
