fiscal and the near term market conditions the downturn in the global economy which commenced in the fall of led to reduced demand for petroleum based products  which in turn led our customers to defer investment in major capital projects 
we believe that we are beginning to see some positive signs that international customers are once again examining investments in major capital projects 
in addition  we believe that the significant increase in construction costs  including raw material costs  which had occurred over the four to five year period prior to the recent downturn  also led to delays in new commitments by our customers 
the increase in costs resulted in the economics of projects becoming less feasible  which we believe caused our customers to choose to wait until costs declined  as they have recently 
currently  near term demand trends that we believe are affecting our customers investments include as the world recovers slowly from the global recession  many emerging economies continue to have relatively strong economic growth 
this expansion is driving growing energy requirements and the need for more refined petroleum products 
although uncertainty in the capital markets continues  there has been some improved access to capital  which has resulted in certain previously stalled projects being released 
the expansion of the middle eastern economies and the continued growth in demand for oil and refined products has renewed investment activity in that area 
we believe that such renewed activity is exemplified by the re starting of projects in both the petrochemical and refining industries  such as the jubail and yanbu export refinery projects in saudi arabia as construction costs for these projects have reportedly been reduced by 
asia  specifically china  has been experiencing renewed demand for refined petroleum products such as gasoline in calendar year and thus far in  following reductions in demand during calendar year as economic uncertainty stymied growth 
this renewed demand is driving increased investment in petrochemical and refining projects 
south america  specifically brazil  venezuela and colombia  is seeing increased refining and petrochemical investments that are driven by their continually expanding economies and increased local demand for gasoline and other products that are made from oil as the feedstock 
the us refining market has declined and refinery utilization has fallen as demand declined from conservation efforts  economic weakness  and uncertainty around us energy policy and its potential 
table of contents impact on production costs 
as a result  there have been fewer investment dollars in capital projects for refineries in the us this is expected to continue for the next few years 
investments in north american oil sands have been delayed as a result of construction costs and uncertainty around us energy policy and the potential impact that changes to the energy policy may have on production costs which has impacted project economics and risk 
recently however  there have been investments in extraction projects in alberta and foreign investment in alberta which suggest that downstream investments that involve our equipment might increase in the next two to three years 
we expect that the consequences of these near term trends will be more pressure on our gross margins  as the us refining market has historically provided higher margins than certain international markets 
because of continued global economic uncertainty and the risk associated with growth in emerging economies  we also expect that we will have continued volatility in our order pattern 
for the next several quarters  we expect to see smaller value projects than what we had seen during the last expansion cycle 
this will require more orders for us to achieve a similar revenue level 
we continue to expect our new order levels to remain volatile  resulting in both strong and weak quarters 
for example  sequentially the past four quarters had new order levels of    and  in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
we believe that looking at our order level in any one quarter does not provide an accurate indication of our future expectations or performance 
rather  we believe that looking at our orders and backlog over a rolling four quarter time period provides a better measure of our business 
shift back to international growth expected to drive next industry cycle over the long term  we expect our customers markets to regain their strength and  while remaining cyclical  continue to grow 
we believe the long term trends remain strong and that the drivers of future growth include demand trends global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the next two decades  primarily in emerging markets 
this is expected to offset estimated flat to slightly declining demand in north america and europe 
increased demand is expected for power  refinery and petrochemical products  stimulated by an expanding middle class in asia 
increased development of geothermal electrical power plants in certain regions is expected to meet projected growth in demand for electrical power 
increased global regulations over the refining and petrochemical industries are expected to continue to drive requirements for capital investments 
increased demand is expected from the nuclear power generation industry and government contractors 
impact of demand trends construction of new petrochemical plants in the middle east  where natural gas is plentiful and less expensive  is expected to continue 
increased investments in new power projects are expected in asia and south america to meet projected consumer demand increases 
global oil refining capacity is projected to increase  and is expected to be addressed through new facilities  refinery upgrades  revamps and expansions 
long term growth potential is believed to exist in alternative energy markets  such as coal to liquids  gas to liquids and other emerging technologies  such as biodiesel  ethanol and waste to energy 

table of contents we believe that all of the above factors offer us long term growth opportunity to meet our customers expected capital project needs 
in addition  we believe we can continue to grow our less cyclical smaller product lines and aftermarket businesses 
emerging markets require petroleum based products 
these markets are expected to continue to grow at rates faster than the us therefore  we expect international opportunities will be more plentiful relative to domestic projects 
our domestic sales as a percentage of aggregate product sales  which had increased over the prior three fiscal years from in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal  decreased to in fiscal the economic recovery  which we believe has partly begun in the international markets  will likely provide greater opportunities than the domestic market in the near term 
our order rates for fiscal were domestic and international 
however  the domestic order level was heavily impacted by a large order in excess of  from northrop grumman to supply surface condensers for the us navy 
if we exclude this project  the international order percentage would have exceeded 
as we look at fiscal and beyond  we believe international sales over the next few years will likely surpass domestic sales 
results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales net income diluted income per share total assets fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a decrease  as compared with sales of  for fiscal the decrease was due to reduced demand for petroleum based products as a result of the economic downturn which caused our customers to defer investment in major capital projects 
this decline in sales occurred in all product lines 
international sales accounted for of all sales for fiscal  which were up from in fiscal domestic sales decreased by  in fiscal international sales declined  in fiscal  driven by sales declines in canada  south america  middle east and europe  somewhat offset by higher sales in asia and africa 
sales for fiscal were to the refining industry down from in fiscal  to the chemical and petrochemical industries up from and to other industrial applications down from  including electrical power 
our gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross profit dollars for fiscal decreased  or  compared with fiscal gross profit dollars decreased due to lower volume  which resulted in the significant under utilization of our production capacity 
the lower volume and utilization declines were partly offset by improved raw material purchasing benefits especially in the first and second quarter of fiscal  and continued improvements in productivity 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  and other expenses for fiscal were  down compared with  in fiscal included in fiscal costs was a pre tax charge of for restructuring costs 
sg a and other expenses as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal to of sales compared with of sales in fiscal sg a expenses decreased due to lower variable costs eg  sales commissions  compensation  headcount expenses related to lower sales and cost controls in place throughout fiscal interest income for fiscal was  down from in fiscal this decrease was due to lower rates of return on our investments  which are primarily short term us treasury securities 

table of contents interest expense was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the increase was due to an interest charge of for unrecognized tax benefits  as discussed below  taken in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with an effective tax rate of for fiscal the increase was due to a charge for unrecognized tax benefits of related to research and development tax credits taken in tax years through such charge is management s estimate of our potential exposure related to an ongoing internal revenue service examination of our research and development tax credits 
we believe our tax position is correct and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our position 
associated with the tax charge was an interest charge of  as noted in the above paragraph  and a tax credit  related to the interest charge 
the combination of these charges and credit was a net charge to earnings of in taxes and in interest  which lowered our earnings per share in fiscal by per share 
excluding the tax charge  our effective tax rate in fiscal was 
the total tax benefit related to the research and development tax credit that is under review by the irs was  at march  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management determined that a portion of the deferred tax assets related to certain state investment tax credits and net operating losses will not be realized and a valuation allowance of was recorded resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate 
net income for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively 
income per diluted share was and for the respective periods 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase  as compared with sales of  for the fiscal year ended march   which we refer to as fiscal this growth in sales came from all product lines of the gain came from pumps  from spare parts  and the remaining from condensers  ejectors and heat exchangers 
international sales accounted for of all sales for fiscal  which was down from in fiscal the strength of the us refining market during fiscal was primarily responsible for such shift 
domestic sales grew  in fiscal international sales declined by in fiscal  driven by sales declines in south america and the middle east due to a slowdown in investment in new capacity 
sales for fiscal were to the refining industry up from in fiscal  to the chemical and petrochemical industries down from and to other industrial applications up from  including electrical power 
our gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross profit dollars for fiscal increased  or  compared with fiscal gross profit dollars increased due to increased volume  improved product mix achieved by increased selectivity on orders accepted  and improved engineering and manufacturing efficiencies 
our improved operating efficiencies  which were a continuation of the gains we saw in fiscal  enabled us to achieve greater sales volume in fiscal without spending significant capital or increasing other fixed costs to increase our manufacturing capacity 
sg a expenses for fiscal remained similar to the fiscal level of 
actual costs in fiscal increased  or  compared with fiscal sg a expenses increased due to greater variable costs eg  sales commissions  variable compensation related to higher sales and net income 
during fiscal  as we entered the economic downturn  we restructured our workforce  eliminating certain management  office and manufacturing positions 
the restructuring resulted in a pre tax charge to earnings of this cost was reported as other expense 
our on going annual cost savings as a result of the restructuring is expected to be approximately  interest income for fiscal was  down from  in fiscal this decrease was due to lower rates of return on our investments  which are primarily short term us treasury securities 
interest expense was in fiscal  down from in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared with an effective tax rate of for fiscal the increase was due to a higher level of pre tax income relative to our allowable level of tax deductions 
net income for fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively 
income per diluted share was and for the respective periods 

table of contents stockholders equity the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity that can be found in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
the following table shows the balance of stockholders equity on the dates indicated march  march  march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  at march  compared with march  this increase was primarily due to net income and an increase in the value of pension assets 
dividends paid in fiscal increased  to  due to a dividend increase which occurred in early fiscal we repurchased shares in the first quarter of fiscal and a total of shares  including repurchases completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase program 
the number of shares remaining that have been approved for repurchase under the stock repurchase program is on march   our net book value was up over march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  at march  compared with march  this increase was primarily due to net income  offset by a decline in the value of pension assets 
in july  we increased our dividend per share from cents per share per year to cents per year 
dividends paid in fiscal increased  or  due to the above mentioned increase as well as an increase in mid fiscal in fiscal  we increased authorized shares from  to  in october  we split our stock for in the form of a stock dividend  increasing the actual outstanding shares to  shares 
we subsequently repurchased shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase program 
on march   our net book value was up over march  liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets appearing in item of part ii of this annual report on form k march  working capital working capital ratio long term debt capital leases long term debt capitalization long term liabilities capitalization working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities 
working capital ratio equals current assets divided by current liabilities 
long term debt capitalization equals long term debt divided by stockholders equity plus long term debt 
long term liabilities capitalization equals total liabilities minus current liabilities divided by stockholders equity plus long term debt 
we use the ratios described above to measure our liquidity and overall financial strength 

table of contents as of march   our contractual and commercial obligations for the next five fiscal years ending march and thereafter were as follows payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases pension and postretirement benefits accrued compensation accrued pension liability other long term liabilities total for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
amounts represent anticipated contributions during fiscal to our postretirement medical benefit plan  which provides healthcare benefits for eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees 
on february   we terminated postretirement healthcare benefits for our us employees 
benefits payable to retirees of record on april  remained unchanged 
we expect to be required to make cash contributions in connection with these plans beyond one year  but such amounts cannot be estimated 
no contributions are expected to be made to our defined benefit pension plan for our fiscal year ending march  net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal the largest single component was an increase in customer deposits of  in fiscal  customer deposits decreased by the increase in customer deposits resulted from major customers providing upfront negotiated cash payments to assist in lowering the cost for graham to complete their projects 
this cash will be utilized to procure materials for these customers projects in the fiscal years ended march  and we refer to the fiscal years ending march  and as fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we often obtain progress payments for large projects from our customers throughout the procurement and manufacturing process 
in the recent instances  more cash was provided shortly after the order was secured 
during fiscal  we expect operating cash flow will be negative as the customer deposits balance is utilized to procure materials to support production 
the other major contributors to operating cash generation were net income   and a reduction in unbilled revenue   compared with fiscal  net income in fiscal was lower by  and the impact of deferred taxes and taxes payable was in fiscal compared with cash generation of  in fiscal offsetting these reductions in cash generation  were cash gains of  in unbilled revenue in fiscal compared with a cash usage of  in fiscal and lower cash usage for pension  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal primarily due to  in contribution to the defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 
cash and cash investments were  on march  compared with  on march   up 
the largest component of the improvement was an increase in customer deposits of  to  on march  compared with  on march  cash and cash investments  net of the customer deposits  as discussed above  was  compared with  we invest net cash generated from operations in excess of cash held for near term needs in us government instruments  generally with maturity periods of up to days 
investments at march  and march  were  and  respectively 
other sources of cash for fiscal included the issuance of common stock to cover stock options exercised  which raised  as compared with in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a increase in capital in excess of par value for the income tax benefit realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of the tax benefit 
table of contents amount recognized pertaining to the fair value of stock option awards treated as compensation expense 
this amount compared with  for fiscal other significant uses of cash for fiscal included our publicly announced stock repurchase program 
under this program  shares of stock were purchased during the first quarter of fiscal at a cost of representing an average price of per share 
this compared with shares purchased in fiscal at a total cost of  representing an average price of per share 
dividend payments of and capital expenditures of  were made in fiscal  compared with and  respectively  for fiscal in fiscal  we repaid in excess of amounts borrowed for bank borrowings and capitalized leases  as compared with for fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal were for plant machinery and equipment and for all other items 
sixty eight percent of our capital spending was for productivity improvements and the balance was primarily for capitalized maintenance 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately  in excess of of our planned fiscal capital expenditures are related to the northrop grumman project for the us navy won in fiscal over of our fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be for machinery and equipment  with the remaining amounts to be used for information technology and other items 
our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na provides us with a line of credit of  including letters of credit and bank guarantees 
borrowings under our credit facility are secured by all of our assets 
letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility on march  and were  and  respectively 
there were no other amounts outstanding on our credit facility at march  and our borrowing rate as of march  was bank of america s prime rate minus basis points  or 
availability under the line of credit was  at march  we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with our investments and available financing capacity under our credit facility  will be adequate to meet our cash needs for the immediate future 
orders and backlog orders during fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively  representing a increase for fiscal and a record high 
orders represent communications received from customers requesting us to supply products and services 
revenue is recognized on orders received in accordance with our revenue recognition policy included in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
domestic orders were  or  of our total orders and international orders were  or  of our total orders in fiscal domestic orders grew by  or  primarily due to a larger order in excess of  from northrop grumman to provide surface condensers for the us navy 
international orders grew by  or  led by renewed refining investment in the middle east 
middle east orders were up  or  compared with fiscal orders from other international regions were down  with decreases in asia  africa and canada partly offset by gains in south america 
backlog was a record  at march  compared with  at march   a increase 
backlog is defined by us as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
during fiscal  we were notified by customers that one project with a value of was cancelled  one order with a value of  was placed on hold suspended pending further evaluation  and one project placed on hold suspended in fiscal valued at was returned to active status 
our backlog has been reduced for the cancelled projects  but continues to include orders placed on hold suspended with an aggregate value of  see project cancellation and project continuation risk in item a of part ii of this annual report on form k 
all orders in backlog represent orders from our traditional markets in established product lines 
approximately to of orders currently in backlog are not expected to be converted to sales within the next twelve months 
at march   approximately of our backlog was attributed to equipment for refinery project work  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications including the northrop grumman order for the us navy 
at march   approximately of our backlog was for refinery project work  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications 

table of contents in may  one order for  which had been placed on hold by our customer in fiscal  was cancelled 
this order was included in the balance of total placed on hold suspended orders that remained in backlog at march  production had started on this project prior to being put on hold 
the customer has requested shipment of the partly completed product as is 
this order will be removed from the balance of on hold suspended orders during the first quarter of fiscal outlook we believe that we are currently experiencing the bottom of the cycle associated with our sales to the refinery and petrochemical markets since we tend to lag the general economic cycle by twelve to eighteen months 
the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the first and second quarter of fiscal are expected to represent the trough in level sales for our business in this down cycle 
sales were  and  in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively 
we expect the first and second quarter of fiscal to be in a similar range with some potential for upside improvement in the second quarter 
we anticipate that sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal will see growth compared with the first and second quarters of fiscal we expect the gross profit margin percentage to be in the mid to upper s range for the first two quarters of fiscal as we continue to have under utilized capacity 
moreover  orders won to months ago that are now planned for revenue in the first and second quarters have depressed margins due to the competitive environment at that time 
our order activity was strong in fiscal and our backlog on march  was  we expect fiscal order levels to continue to be variable across the year  as we have seen in the past eight sequential quarters 
we do not believe that our markets have fully recovered  and while we have seen some improvements in the middle east  asia and recently  south america  it is not clear that the recovery has fully taken hold 
we also believe the domestic market will be relatively weak for fiscal and beyond 
normally  we convert to of existing backlog to sales within a month period 
however  we have a few large orders eg northrop grumman for the us navy project and a couple large middle east refinery orders that will extend our march  backlog well beyond this normal level 
we expect to convert approximately to of our march  backlog to sales in fiscal for fiscal  we expect sales to be above fiscal  with the full year sales projected to increase by to to between  and  the lower end of this range  as well as potential downside risk is tied to our customers releasing projects for production 
the upper end of the range and any potential upside above the expected range  may be achieved by faster conversion of backlog to sales if customers are willing to accept earlier than currently planned shipments as well as the receipt of new orders which can convert to sales within the fiscal year 
we expect gross profit margin to be in the to range 
this margin level is below fiscal  which had strong margins in the first two quarters resulting from purchasing advantages gained with raw material cost benefits 
our margins in fiscal will likely be adversely affected by the following a significantly enhanced competitive environment which has been evident through recent orders during the contraction of the industry as competitors have been aggressively pursuing fewer projects  a shift toward international markets  where margins are generally lower than domestic project margins  and continued expected underutilization of capacity  especially in the first two quarters of fiscal gross profit margins are expected to improve as volume increases throughout fiscal and beyond 
we would caution that due to changes in geographical markets and end use markets  we expect gross margins are unlikely to reach the range achieved in the prior up cycle 
we believe gross profit margin percentage in the mid to upper s is a more realistic expectation 
we also expect this recovery will be more focused on emerging markets  which historically have lower margins and more competitive pricing than developed markets 
in addition  we expect more growth in power markets  which typically provide lower margins than refining and chemical processing end users 
we believe to achieve the upper end of our margin projections and potential upside above the range can occur with the following a 
increased volume to minimize under utilization of capacity  b 
continued improvements in manufacturing productivity  and c 
continued focus and success in error elimination and rework 

table of contents sg a spending is expected to increase during fiscal to between  and  our effective tax rate during fiscal is expected to be between and 
cash flow in fiscal is expected to be negative due to the drawdown of customer deposits which grew in the fourth quarter of fiscal from  at december  to  at march  the increase in customer deposits was due to a number of major customers who provided upfront negotiated cash payments to assist in lowering the cost for graham to complete their projects 
this cash will be utilized to procure materials for these customers projects in fiscal and fiscal we also expect to spend  to  in capital spending  above our normal  to  range  due to a  capital project required for the northrop grumman project for the us navy 
contingencies and commitments we have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos contained in our products 
we are a co defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
the claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant 
such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs places of work or were settled by us for amounts below expected defense costs 
neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the potential for liability can be determined at this time 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal proceedings and potential claims 
as of march   other than noted above  we were unaware of any other material litigation matters 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess of four weeks which approximates direct labor hours using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred as of a specific date to our estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated material and labor costs at completion 
losses on contracts are recognized immediately  when evident to management 
revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is recognized utilizing the completed contract method 
the majority of the contracts we enter into have a planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do not vary materially from the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is required throughout the construction process and we have no further material obligations under the contracts after the revenue is recognized 
pension and postretirement benefits 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
we base the discount rate assumption for our plans on moody s or citigroup pension liability index aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on long term actual experience 
table of contents and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of liabilities and assets measured using the enacted tax rate 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates 
we evaluate available information about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
critical accounting estimates and judgments we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to labor hour estimates used to recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method  accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
as discussed above under the heading critical accounting policies  we recognize a substantial amount of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the key estimate of percentage of completion accounting is total labor to be incurred on each contract and to the extent that this estimate changes  it may significantly impact revenue recognized in each period 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require us to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
for more information on these matters see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments 
the discount rate assumption for fiscal is for our defined benefit pension and for our other postretirement benefit plan 
a reduction in the discount rate of basis points  with all other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan by approximately and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of used in accounting for our pension plan is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment 
table of contents returns 
a reduction in the rate of return of basis points  with other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic pension expense by approximately as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our managers with functional responsibilities for financial  credit  tax  engineering  manufacturing and benefit matters  and outside advisors such as lawyers  consultants and actuaries 
we believe that the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k related to revenue  contingencies  pensions  other post retirement benefits and other matters requiring the use of estimates and judgments are reasonable  although actual outcomes could differ materially from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in the normal course of business  management evaluates all new accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board  the sec  the emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 
based upon this review  management does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements  which have not already been adopted  to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from changes in the market to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates  price risk and project cancellation risk 
the assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate  price risk and project cancellation risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods  our current knowledge of the marketplace  and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
foreign currency international consolidated sales for fiscal were of total sales compared with for fiscal operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies 
business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified 
in addition  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to us dollars 
in each of fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  all sales to the company and its wholly owned subsidiary for which we were paid were denominated in the local currency us dollars or rmb 
at certain times  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
we have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our purchases in foreign currencies represented  and  respectively  of the cost of products sold 
at certain times  we may utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to limit currency exposure 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in fiscal or fiscal  and as of march  and  respectively  we held no forward foreign currency contracts 

table of contents price risk operating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which  in some instances  benefit from lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions 
although we believe that our customers differentiate our products on the basis of our manufacturing quality and engineering experience and excellence  among other things  such lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions mean that certain of our competitors are able to offer products similar to ours at lower prices 
moreover  the cost of metals and other materials used in our products have experienced significant volatility 
such factors  in addition to the global effects of the recent volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets  have resulted in downward demand and pricing pressure on our products 
project cancellation and project continuation risk recent economic conditions have led to a higher likelihood of project cancellation by our customers 
we had one project for cancelled in fiscal in fiscal  three projects were cancelled  totaling  we attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred 
as a result  we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled 
open orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers 
if it becomes evident to us that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date  management will move the project into placed on hold ie  suspended category 
furthermore  if a project is cancelled by our customer  it is removed from our backlog
