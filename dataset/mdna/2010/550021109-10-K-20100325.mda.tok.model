item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity during the three year period ending january  our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to january of the following year  typically resulting in a week year  but occasionally giving rise to an additional week  resulting in a week year 
fiscal  and ended on january   february  and february   respectively 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions set forth in the special note regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the item a risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the world economy and capital markets are continuing to experience the effects of unprecedented volatility 
during fiscal  there was a considerable slow down as problems in global financial markets became more widespread and consumers cut back on retail spending amid fears of a global recession 
our sales growth slowed in the latter part of fiscal  driven in part by this reduced spending 
this challenging economic climate and the continued weakness of the canadian dollar continued to negatively affect our financial results during the beginning of fiscal recently  the global economy has shown some signs of improvement  as reflected in our current quarter net revenue growth  and the canadian dollar has strengthened relative to the united states dollar 
this growth however  does not match the rapid growth we realized in prior years 
management recognizes the difficult economic situation that many of our consumers are still facing and does not expect our rate of growth to change significantly in the next fiscal year 
in response to the changes in the world economy and the impact on our operating results  we have taken several steps to address the deterioration in the retail environment and to address our support structure 
these steps  which we discussed in our annual report on form k for fiscal filed with the sec on march   included the development and implementation of several important initiatives as part of our strategy designed to increase customer traffic in our corporate owned store locations  reduce infrastructure expenses and improve our operating results 
we continue to realize the positive effects of our cost reductions and efficiency initiatives  and expect that such initiatives  combined with modest net revenue growth  will continue to impact our financial results during fiscal these targeted cost reductions and associated efficiency efforts were designed to structure our business for long term profitable growth and to protect our brand integrity 
we believe our continued strong cash flow generation  solid balance sheet and healthy liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility to continue executing the initiatives we implemented at the end of fiscal  as well as make investments at strategic times going forward which will benefit our company 
operating segment overview lululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in north america 
our yoga inspired apparel is primarily marketed under the lululemon athletica brand name 
we offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants  shorts  tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga  running and general fitness 
as of january   our branded apparel was principally sold through corporate owned and franchise stores that are primarily located in canada and the united states and via our retail website through our direct to consumers sales channel 
we believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand 
in fiscal  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in canada  of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the united states and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of north america

in fiscal  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in canada  of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the united states and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of north america 
our net revenue has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this represents a compound net annual growth rate of 
our net revenue from continuing operations also increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  representing a increase 
our increase in net revenue from fiscal to fiscal resulted from the net addition of seven retail locations and our e commerce sales channel in fiscal  retail locations in fiscal  retail locations in fiscal  retail locations in fiscal and retail locations in fiscal  and comparable store sales growth of   and in fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand 
we believe our superior products  strategic store locations  inviting store environment  grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance 
we have recently increased our focus on our men s apparel line  net revenue from which increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and represented approximately of net revenue in fiscal versus of net revenue in fiscal  and our accessories line  which also increased in proportion to net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal we have three reportable segments corporate owned stores  franchises and other 
we report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses 
while we receive financial information for each corporate owned store  we have aggregated all of the corporate owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores 
our franchises segment accounted for of our net revenues from continuing operations in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near term growth strategy  and we therefore expect that if the revenue derived from our franchise stores continues to comprise less than of the net revenue we report in future fiscal years 
our other operations  consisting of direct to consumer sales  wholesale accounts  warehouse sales and sales from company operated showrooms  accounted for less than of our net revenues from continuing operations in each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we will re evaluate our segment reporting disclosures in fiscal as of january   we sold our products through corporate owned stores located in canada and the united states 
as previously disclosed  we discontinued our operations in japan 
we plan to increase our net revenue in north america by opening additional corporate owned stores in new and existing markets 
corporate owned stores net revenue accounted for of total net revenue in fiscal and of total net revenue in fiscal as of january   we also had five franchise stores located in north america and nine franchise stores located in australia 
in the past  we have entered into franchise agreements to distribute lululemon athletica branded products to more quickly disseminate our brand name and increase our net revenue and net income 
in exchange for the use of our brand name and the ability to operate lululemon athletica stores in certain regions  our franchisees generally pay us a one time franchise fee and ongoing royalties based on their gross revenue 
additionally  unless otherwise approved by us  our franchisees are required to sell only lululemon athletica branded products  which are purchased from us at a discount to the suggested retail price 
pursuing new franchise partnerships or opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near term store growth strategy 
in some cases  we may exercise our contractual rights to purchase franchises where it is attractive to us 
we believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of north america who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style 
in  we opened our first franchise store in australia 
during fiscal we invested in new harbour yoga pty ltd 
formerly known as lululemon athletica australia pty ltd 
which operates nine franchise stores 
in  we opened a franchise store in japan 
in  we terminated our franchise arrangement and entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese apparel 
table of contents company descente ltd  or descente  a global leader in fabric technology  to operate our stores in japan  which were discontinued in fiscal in addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate owned stores and our franchises  we also derive other net revenue  which includes the sale of our products direct to consumers through our e commerce and phone sales channels  as well as wholesale customers  including related shipping and handling charges  warehouse sales and sales through a number of company operated showrooms 
e commerce sales are taken directly from retail customers through www 
lululemon 
com 
wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios  health clubs and fitness centers 
phone sales are taken directly from retail customers through our call center 
warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices 
our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours 
other net revenue accounted for of total net revenue in fiscal and of total net revenue in fiscal basis of presentation net revenue is comprised of corporate owned store net revenue  which includes sales to customers through corporate owned stores  franchises net revenue  which consists of licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises  and other net revenue  which includes direct to consumer sales  wholesale accounts  warehouse sales and sales from company operated showrooms 
in each case  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts 
in addition  we separately track comparable store sales  which reflect net revenue at corporate owned stores that have been open for at least months 
therefore  net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales 
non comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open for months  sales from franchises  direct to consumer sales  wholesale and showrooms  and sales from corporate owned stores which we have closed 
by measuring the change in year over year net revenue in stores that have been open for months or more  comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including the location of new stores relative to existing stores  consumer preferences  buying trends and overall economic trends  our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel  competition  changes in our merchandise mix  pricing  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts  the level of customer service that we provide in our stores  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  and the number of stores we open  close including for temporary renovations and expand in any period 
opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy 
accordingly  comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than months 

table of contents cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise  inbound freight  duty and non refundable taxes incurred in delivering goods to our distribution centers  the cost of our distribution centers such as rent and utilities as well as other fees we pay to third parties to operate our distribution centers and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers  the cost of our production  merchandise and design departments including salaries  stock based compensation and benefits  and operating expenses  the cost of occupancy related to store operations such as rent and utilities and the depreciation and amortization related to store level capital expenditures  hemming  and shrink and valuation reserves 
cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs 
the primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold and provision for impairment and lease exit costs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include marketing costs  accounting costs  information technology costs  professional fees  corporate facility costs  corporate and store level payroll and benefits expenses  and depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store level capital expenditures and our distribution centers  each of which are included in cost of goods sold 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store level employees 
provision for impairment and lease exit costs consists of asset impairments  lease exit and other related costs associated with the closure of one us corporate owned store in the first quarter of fiscal and one us corporate owned store in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as an asset impairment provision based on management s ongoing evaluation of its portfolio of corporate owned store locations 
long lived assets are reviewed at the store level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question 
factors used in the evaluation include  but are not limited to  management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
stock based compensation expense includes charges incurred in recognition of compensation expense associated with grants of stock options and grants of restricted stock units 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for both awards granted by us and awards granted under a stockholder sponsored plan 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
prior to our initial public offering in july  the fair value of the shares of common stock that underlie the stock options we granted was determined by our board of directors 
our board of directors determined a valuation of lululemon as of april  the valuation was calculated based upon the equity value implied by the december transaction in which mr 
wilson sold of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors for approximately million 
at the time  our board of directors believed the december transaction was a valid indication of fair value because the terms of the december transaction were the result of arms length negotiations among independent parties 
because there had been no public market for our common stock  our board used this valuation to determine the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the options 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements necessary for our initial public offering and based in part on discussions with prospective underwriters for the planned offering  in march we reassessed the estimated accounting fair value as of january of common stock in light of the potential completion of the initial public offering 
after reviewing its valuation  our board of directors determined that the valuation would not be appropriate for valuing the options as the valuation did not fully consider requirements under fasb asc topic 
table of contents compensation stock compensation which codified former statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payments and other relevant regulatory guidelines  specifically the valuation did not coincide with the option grant dates  and the valuation incorrectly included a minority interest discount 
as a result  management determined that it would be necessary to retrospectively calculate a new valuation for the july option grants 
based upon the reassessment  we determined that the accounting fair value of the options granted to employees from february  to january  was greater than the exercise price for certain of those options 
the comparison of the originally determined fair value and reassessed fair value is as follows for all dates on which an option was granted  assuming that our corporate reorganization had occurred and using the initial public offering price of per share weighted weghted initial original average number of average public fair value reassessed options exercise offering assessment fair value grant date granted price price of options of options july  december  december  january  based upon the reassessment discussed above  we determined the reassessed accounting fair value of the options to purchase  shares of common stock granted to employees during the period from february  to january  ranged from a weighted average price of to per share 
as a result of the reassessed fair value of our grants of stock options  the aggregate fair value of our stock options increased by million 
there are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the reassessed accounting fair values 
for this and other reasons  the reassessed accounting fair value used to compute the stock based compensation expense may not be reflective of the fair market value that would result from the application of other valuation methods  including accepted valuation methods for tax purposes 
we record our stock based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses as stock based awards have been made to employees whose salaries are classified in both expense categories 
other income expense  net includes interest earned on our cash balances and our advances to franchise  interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise and our share of the operations of our investment in new harbour yoga pty ltd 
the australian franchise operator 
we expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment 
we have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so 
provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products 
historically we have generated taxable income in canada and we have generated tax losses in the united states 
for periods up to and including the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our losses in the united states 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we earned taxable income in the united states 
during the second quarter of fiscal  after considering a number of factors  including recent taxable income  utilization of previously unrealized net operating losses  or nols  our growth strategy as well as other business and macroeconomic factors  we determined that we would more likely than not realize the benefit of deferred tax assets through future taxable income 
we have recorded deferred tax assets in respect of foreign tax credits and other deductible temporary differences of million as at january  several factors have contributed to our effective tax rate fluctuating in recent periods 
first  in fiscal and fiscal  we generated losses in the united states which we were unable to offset against our income in canada 

table of contents second  we incurred stock based compensation expense of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes in canada and the united states during these periods 
third  the canadian corporate tax rate decrease in fiscal from to 
fourth  in fiscal we began to release the valuation against us loss carry forwards 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal we anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of canada  the united states and australia  in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly

table of contents comparison of fiscal to fiscal net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base as well as sales from new stores opened 
assuming the average exchange rate between the canadian and united states dollars in fiscal remained constant  our net revenue would have increased million  or  in fiscal the constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines  successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name

this was partially offset by increased franchise revenue of million from our one remaining canadian franchise location and four franchise locations in the united states

income from operations before general corporate expenses from our corporate owned stores segment increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in corporate owned stores gross profit of million  offset by an increase of million in store employee expenses  million in administrative expenses  and an increase of million in other store expenses  our franchises segment decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of franchise income from operations of million included in the comparative period shifting to corporate owned stores income from operations when we acquired two franchise stores in victoria  british columbia and one franchise store in bellevue  washington  partially offset by increased franchise income from operations of million from our remaining franchise locations  and our other segment decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in product costs  offset by an increase in revenue of million 
income from operations also includes general corporate expenses 
general corporate expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in corporate employee costs of million  a provision for impairment and lease exit costs of million and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses of million 
our million provision for impairment and lease exit costs was a result of management s review of our portfolio of corporate owned store locations 
in conjunction with our ongoing evaluation to ensure that each of our corporate owned stores fit into our long term growth strategy we closed one of our corporate owned stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge related to this closure  which included a million asset impairment and a million accrual for lease exit costs 
the fair market values were estimated using an expected present value technique 
we identified four other corporate owned store locations 
table of contents where the carrying amount of the assets exceeded management s estimate of the fair value of the location 
asset impairment of million was recorded as at february  related to these locations 
further  we accrued million for lease exit costs related to certain locations which management has identified as underperforming corporate owned stores 
other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of the million decrease in other income expense  net million resulted from a decrease in interest income  and million resulted from an increase in equity loss associated with our investment in australia 
this amount was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  our effective tax rate was compared to in fiscal the reduction in the effective tax rate in fiscal resulted from the decrease in the canadian corporate tax rate from to as well as the release of the valuation against us loss carryforwards 
net income net income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net income of million in fiscal was a result of an increase in gross profit of million resulting from sales from additional corporate owned stores opened and an increase of million in provision for income taxes  offset by increases in selling  general and administrative expenses of million and a million provision for impairment and lease exit costs 
seasonality in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recognized a significant amount of our net revenue in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in sales during the holiday season 
we recognized  and of our full year gross profit in the fourth quarter in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date 
as our expected growth rate slows  we believe that we will experience fourth quarter gross profits as a percentage of full year gross profits as high  or higher  than in the current year 
the level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business 
we expect inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season 
because our products are sold primarily through our stores  order backlog is not material to our business 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling existing stores  making information technology system enhancements and funding working capital requirements 
cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
as of january   our working capital deficit excluding cash and cash equivalents was million and our cash and cash equivalents were million 

table of contents the following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities for the periods indicated fiscal year ended january  february  february  in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  realized gains and losses on property and equipment  stock based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non cash working capital items  principally accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased million  to million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the million increase was primarily a result of increased net income as we expanded our store base and a net decrease in the change in other working capital balances  partially offset by a decrease in items not affecting cash 
the net decrease in the change in other working capital balances was primarily due to an increase in accrued liabilities resulting from a provision for impairment and lease exit costs and was partially offset by an increase in the change in inventories as we build up spring and summer inventories for a larger store base 
the decrease in items not affecting cash was primarily due to decreases in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and deferred income taxes  and was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization related to our increased store base 
depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  computer hardware and software  equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation for our corporate owned store segment was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation related to corporate activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we have not allocated any depreciation to our franchises or other segments as these amounts to date have been immaterial 
investing activities investing activities relate entirely to capital expenditures  investments in and advances to franchises  and acquisitions of franchises 
cash used in investing activities decreased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease in cash used in investing activities represents a decrease in the number of new stores opened in fiscal compared to fiscal  offset by store improvements on a larger store base 
capital expenditures for our corporate owned stores segment were million in fiscal which included million to open ten corporate owned stores and million in fiscal  which included million to open corporate owned stores not including three acquired franchise stores 
the remaining capital expenditures for our corporate owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment 
capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology 
there were no capital expenditures associated with our franchises and other segments 
investment in and advances to franchises 
table of contents are to new harbour yoga pty ltd 
in fiscal and fiscal  we purchased our franchises in victoria  british columbia and bellevue  washington for million and calgary  alberta for million  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to range between million to million in fiscal  including approximately million to million for approximately to new stores and the remainder reflecting renovation capital for existing stores  information technology enhancements and other corporate activities 
financing activities financing activities consist primarily of cash received on the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash provided by financing activities decreased million  to cash used of million in fiscal from cash provided of million in fiscal we believe that our cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in risk factors 
in addition  we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores  distribution facility  headquarters  or other systems  which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations 
revolving credit facility in april  we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with royal bank of canada 
the revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to cdn million 
the revolving credit facility must be repaid in full on demand and is available by way of prime loans in canadian currency  us base rate loans in us currency  bankers acceptances  libor based loans in us currency or euro currency  letters of credit in canadian currency or us currency and letters of guaranty in canadian currency or us currency 
the revolving credit facility bears interest on the outstanding balance in accordance with the following i prime rate for prime loans  ii us base rate for us based loans  iii a fee of per annum on bankers acceptances  iv libor plus per annum for libor based loans  v a annual fee for letters of credit  and vi a annual fee for letters of guaranty 
both lululemon usa inc 
and lululemon fc usa inc  inc provided royal bank of canada with guarantees and postponements of claims in the amounts of cdn million with respect to lululemon athletica canada inc 
s obligations under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present and after acquired personal property  including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries 
as of january   aside from the letters of credit and guarantees  we had nil in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
contractual obligations and commitments leases 
we lease certain corporate owned store locations  storage spaces  building and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
our leases generally have initial terms of between five and years  and generally can be extended only in five year increments  if at all 
our leases expire at various dates between and  excluding extensions at our option 
a substantial number of our leases for corporate owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses  rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives  none of which are reflected in the following table 
most of our leases for corporate owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume  the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table 
during the third quarter of fiscal we were released from our contractual obligation related to the new head office location in vancouver  british columbia 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of january   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by fiscal year total thereafter in thousands operating leases minimum rent includes and for each of the years ending in and thereafter for one store lease which was terminated on may  
table of contents franchise agreements 
as of january   we operated five stores in north america and nine stores in australia through franchise agreements 
under the terms of our franchise agreements  unless otherwise approved by us  franchisees are permitted to sell only lululemon athletica products  are required to purchase their inventory from us  which we sell at a slight premium to our cost  and are required to pay us a royalty based on a percentage of their gross sales 
under some of our franchise agreements  we have the ability to repurchase franchises at a price equal to a specified percentage of trailing month sales 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise 
we also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations  including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases 
as of january   letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling million have been issued 
other than these standby letters of credit  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
in addition  we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and  as such  requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
net revenue is comprised of corporate owned store net revenue  franchise licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees  and other net revenue  which includes direct to consumer sales through www 
lululemon 
com  sales to wholesale accounts  phone sales  warehouse sales and sales from company operated showrooms  in each case  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts 
sales to customers through corporate owned stores are recognized at the point of sale  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns 
franchise licensing fees and royalties are recognized when earned  in accordance with the terms of the franchise license agreements 
royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees sales and recognized when those sales occur 
franchise fee net revenue arising from the sale of a franchise is recognized when the agreement has been signed and all of our substantial obligations have been completed 
other net revenue is recognized when goods are shipped and collection is reasonably assured  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns 
other net revenue related to warehouse sales is recognized when these sales occur 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment 
sales are reported on a net revenue basis  which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes  actual product returns received  discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns 
our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue 
this allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns  estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events 
consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns 
our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately days after the sale of the merchandise 
for our wholesale sales  we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved 
employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue 
revenues from the company s gift cards are recognized when tendered for payment  or upon redemption 
outstanding customer balances are included in unredeemed gift card liability on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents there are no expiration dates on the company s gift cards  and lululemon does not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances 
while the company will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment  management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to  among other things  long periods of inactivity 
in these circumstances  to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws  card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in net revenue 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable primarily arise out of sales to wholesale accounts  sales of products and royalties on sales owed to us by our franchises 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable 
this allowance is established based on the specific circumstances associated with the credit risk of the receivable  the size of the accounts receivable balance  aging of accounts receivable balances and our collection history and other relevant information 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a monthly basis 
receivables are charged to the allowance when management believes the account will not be recovered 
inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market 
cost is determined using weighted average costs 
for finished goods  market is defined as net realizable value  and for raw materials  market is defined as replacement cost 
cost of inventories includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor  as applicable  and all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight  non refundable taxes  duty and other landing costs 
we periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods 
the amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands  selling prices and market conditions 
in addition  as part of inventory valuations  we review for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventories 
inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items 
we perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink reserve accordingly 
in fiscal  we wrote off million of inventory and in fiscal we wrote off million of inventory 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized 
all other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease  without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets  up to a maximum of five years 
all other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows furniture and fixtures computer hardware and software equipment and vehicles we recognize a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation  or aro  when such obligation is incurred 
our aros are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement 
at the inception of a lease with such conditions  we record an aro liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation 
the liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management s judgment  including store closing costs  cost inflation rates and discount rates  and is accreted to its projected future value over time 
the capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets 
upon satisfaction of the aro conditions  any difference between the recorded aro liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to fiscal these obligations were not material 
we recognize a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when such obligation is incurred 
an exit or disposal activity is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
we estimate fair value at the cease use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated 
table of contents sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property  even where we does not intend to enter into a sublease 
estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions  including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income 
the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 
lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition 
impaired assets are recorded at fair value  determined principally by discounting the future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition 
reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell 
any write downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale 
gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs 
income taxes 
we follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts  including current and proposed tax legislation  current and anticipated taxable income  utilization of previously unrealized non operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings 
given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used  we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change 
for financial reporting purposes  we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction 
because our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations  we do not provide us income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations 
this assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production  fiscal requirements by tax jurisdiction of our operations and operational and fiscal objectives by tax jurisdiction for our operations 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future 
we file income tax returns in the united states  canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions 
we are subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in all jurisdictions from our inception to date 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense 
at january   we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties 
our intercompany transfer pricing policies will be subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions 
although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
goodwill and intangible assets 
intangible assets are recorded at cost 
non competition agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of five years 
reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of years 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite useful live intangible assets might be impaired 
we use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing 
when the carrying 
table of contents amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation using the fair value method 
the fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
our calculation of stock based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions  including future forfeitures  stock price volatility  expected life of the options and related tax effects 
prior to our initial public offering  our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of factors  most significantly our implied enterprise value based upon the purchase price of our securities sold in december pursuant to an arms length private placement to a group of private equity investors 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures  such as types of awards  size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and  ultimately  the expense we record 
for awards with service and or performance conditions  the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest 
for awards with performance conditions  we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes 
for awards with market and or performance conditions  all compensation expense is recognized if the underlying market or performance conditions are fulfilled 
certain employees are entitled to share based awards from the principal stockholders of the company 
these awards are accounted for as employee compensation expense in accordance with the above noted policies 
we commenced applying this guidance when we introduced share based awards for our employees in the year ended january  recent accounting pronouncements on july   the accounting standards codification  or asc  became the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  officially recognized source of authoritative gaap  superseding existing fasb  the american institute of certified accountants  the emerging issues task force and related literature 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under the authority of federal securities law are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature is considered non authoritative 
the switch to the asc affects the way companies refer to gaap in financial statements and accounting policies 
citing particular content in the asc involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the topic  section and paragraph structure 
this standard was effective prospectively for reporting periods ended after september  and  accordingly  we adopted it during the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as a result of adopting this standard  our references to gaap standards have been changed to refer to topics  subtopics  sections or subsections of the asc  as appropriate 
in june  the fasb amended asc topic  consolidation  which requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  or vie  and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder a primary beneficiary of the vie 
the amendment will be effective for us at the beginning of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption may have on its consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asc topic  subsequent events  or asc asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  asc sets forth the period after the balance sheet 
table of contents date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its consolidated financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
subsequent events were evaluated through march  which is the date the financial statements were issued 
we have determined that the standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb amended asc topic  intangibles and other  or asc this new accounting standard  currently contained in asc  specifically amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the objective of this amendment is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
this new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effective date  as well as the adoption date for us  was february  although asc may impact our reporting in future financial periods  we have determined that the standard did not have any impact on our historical consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption 
in february  the fasb partially delayed the effective date of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  for one year for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis 
the effective date  as well as the adoption date for us  was february  we have determined that the provisions of the topic which were delayed did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb revised the accounting standards for business combinations 
this new standard currently contained in asc topic  business combinations  or asc  among other things  generally requires that an acquirer recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their full fair values on the acquisition date 
this practice replaces the practice  under predecessor accounting standards  of allocating the cost of an acquisition to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative estimated fair values 
this new standard further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the related acquisition 
in april  the fasb issued asc  business combinations identifiable assets and liabilities and any non controlling interest  which further amends and clarifies asc and applies to assets acquired and liabilities assumed that arise from contingencies in a business combination 
this new standard and the amendment must be applied prospectively to business combinations consummated on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the effective date  as well as the adoption date for us  was february  although asc may impact our reporting in future financial periods  we have determined that the standard did not have any impact on our historical consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we currently generate the majority of our net revenue in canada 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
historically  our operations were based largely in canada 
as of january   we operated stores in canada 
as a result  we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future 
as we recognize net revenue from sales in canada in canadian dollars  and the us dollar has weakened during fiscal  it has had a positive impact on our canadian operating results upon translation of those results into us dollars for the purposes of consolidation 
however  the gain in net revenue was partially offset by higher cost of sales and higher selling  general and administrative expenses that are generated in canadian dollars 
a depreciation in the relative value of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal to the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in canadian dollars  we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates 
we 
table of contents do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
interest rate risk 
in april  we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with royal bank of canada 
the revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to cdn million 
because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates  if we have a meaningful outstanding balance 
as of january   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility 
we had small outstanding balances under our revolving facility during fiscal as we built inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season  but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk 
we currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
these may take the form of forward sales contracts  option contracts  and interest rate swaps 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
