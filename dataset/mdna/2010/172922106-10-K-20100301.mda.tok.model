earnings overview for the year ended december   a net loss available to common shareholders was reported of  or per share  while net income was  per share basic and diluted in and  per share basic and diluted in the net loss for the year ended december  included the impact of after tax other than temporary impairment otti charges on available for sale securities adjusted for realized gains on some securities subsequently sold of  in  the after tax impact of otti charges was  there were no otti charges in core earnings is an earnings performance measurement which the corporation s management has defined to exclude the effects of otti losses on available for sale securities and realized gains on securities for which otti has previously been recognized 
core earnings is a performance measurement that is not based on us generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes core earnings information is meaningful for evaluating the corporation s operating performance  because it excludes some of the impact of market volatility as it relates to investments in pooled trust preferred securities and other securities 
more information concerning core earnings  including a reconciliation to the corporation s earnings results based on us generally accepted accounting principles  is provided in the following section of management s discussion and analysis 
the corporation s results for included positive core earnings available to common shareholders of  per diluted share  reduced by after tax otti charges on available for sale securities net of subsequent gains from selling some of the securities of  in  the corporation had core earnings of  per diluted share  and core earnings for totaled  per diluted share 
pre tax otti charges totaled  in and  in  with no otti charges in a summary of pre tax otti charges is as follows in thousands pooled trust preferred securities mezzanine tranches marketable equity securities bank stocks trust preferred securities issued by individual institutions collateralized mortgage obligations net impairment losses recognized in earnings pooled trust preferred securities are very long term usually year maturity instruments  mainly issued by banks 
the corporation s investments in pooled trust preferred securities are each made up of companies with geographic and size diversification 
almost all of the corporation s pooled trust preferred securities are composed of debt issued by banking companies  with lesser amounts issued by insurance companies and real estate investment trusts 
management evaluates the pooled trust preferred securities for otti by estimating the cash flows expected to be received from each security  taking into account estimated levels of deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuers 
in determining cash flows  management assumes all issuers currently deferring or in default would make no future payments  and assigns estimated future default levels for the remaining issuers in each security based on financial strength ratings assigned by a national ratings service 
the corporation s process for evaluating pooled trust preferred securities for otti is described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
after the impact of the impairment charges  the corporation s cost basis in pooled trust preferred securities at december  totaled million  including senior tranche assets of million and mezzanine tranche assets of million 
the estimated fair value at december  of pooled trust preferred securities was million 
as described in more detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the corporation adopted new accounting principles in  which resulted in the impairment of debt securities being separated into a the amount of the total impairment related to credit loss  which is recognized in the income statement  and b the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
in  the effect of the new principles was to increase impairment losses recognized in earnings by  and decrease the income tax provision by  resulting in a decrease in net income larger net loss of  or per average common share 
statement regarding non gaap financial measurement this report contains supplemental financial information determined by a method other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
management uses this non gaap measure in its analysis of the corporation s performance 
this measure  core earnings  excludes the effects of otti losses on available for sale securities and realized gains on securities for which otti has previously been recognized 
management believes the presentation of this financial measure  which excludes the impact of the specified items  provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of the corporation 
the core earnings measure provides a method to assess operating performance excluding the impact of market volatility related to investments in pooled trust preferred securities and other securities 
this disclosure should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with gaap  nor is it necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies

vs 
the most significant changes in components of the corporation s core earnings results for  as compared to  were as follows the interest margin increased  or 
on a fully taxable equivalent basis  the interest margin increased  or 
the interest margin has been positively impacted by lower short term market interest rates  which have reduced interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the interest margin has also been positively impacted by increased levels of investments and high yields on municipal bonds 
the interest margin has been negatively impacted by weak consumer loan demand  as average loans outstanding have shrunk approximately million in as compared to the provision for loan losses was  lower in than in the ratio of nonperforming loans including nonaccrual loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest and other real estate owned  as a percentage of assets  was at december   higher than the level at december   but still relatively low by historical standards 
non interest income decreased  or 
in  non interest income included a gain of  from redemption of restricted shares of visa  resulting from visa s initial public offering 
also  in  the corporation received no dividend income on its investment in restricted stock issued by the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  while dividend income on this stock was  in non interest expense increased  or 
fdic insurance assessments increased  in  to  from  the higher fdic assessments included the effects of premium increases and a special assessment of  excluding fdic costs  total non interest expense was lower in than in core earnings for were reduced by dividends on preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program of more detailed information concerning fluctuations in the corporation s earnings results are provided in other sections of management s discussion and analysis 
vs 
net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of  or per diluted share  in as defined above  core earnings per diluted share were in  as compared to in the most significant changes in components of the corporation s core earnings results for  as compared to  were as follows the interest margin was  or  higher in the improved interest margin includes the impact of the citizens bancorp  inc acquisition  which was effective may  the interest margin was also positively impacted by lower market interest rates  which reduced interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings  and by higher earnings on the investment portfolio resulting from higher average total holdings of securities 
non interest income increased  or  in over service charges on deposit accounts increased  or  as a result of growth in deposit volumes from the citizens bancorp acquisition  as well as higher fees associated with a new overdraft privilege program 
also  in  noninterest income included a gain of  from redemption of restricted shares of visa  resulting from visa s initial public offering 
outlook for as described in the earnings overview section above  the corporation reported a net loss for note to the consolidated financial statements presents quarterly income statement data that shows there was a net loss in each of the first three quarters of  primarily because of substantial securities write downs  and positive net income of million per diluted share in the fourth quarter while management cannot guarantee there will be no additional securities losses  based on the relatively small million remaining cost basis of mezzanine pooled trust preferred securities as of december   we believe the vast majority of losses have been realized 
core earnings as defined above results for reflect the impact of significant operational changes made in and  including successful implementation of an overdraft privilege program  as well as other enhancements to noninterest revenue sources 
management also improved efficiency of various operational activities  which has resulted in significant expense reductions 
in  management expects the corporation s earnings results to continue to reflect some of the positive effects of these changes 
a major variable that affects the corporation s earnings is securities gains and losses 
the corporation s and losses from trust preferred securities and other securities stem from the much publicized economic problems affecting the national and international economy  which have particularly hurt the banking industry 
although management believes these conditions to be cyclical  the corporation has exposure to the possibility of future losses from investments in a senior tranche pooled trust preferred security  trust preferred securities issued by individual banks  bank stocks  private label collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and other securities 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides more detail concerning the corporation s investment securities 
in light of weak economic conditions  the federal reserve has taken actions that have driven interest rates down to very low levels by historical standards  including establishing the federal funds target rate at a range of to throughout some recent economic reports reflect improvement in us economic conditions  which could result in the federal reserve beginning to take actions designed to raise interest rates before the end of as described in more detail in item a of this form k  the corporation is liability sensitive  meaning that net interest income tends to increase when interest rates fall  but that net interest income tends to decrease when rates rise 
one of the ways management monitors exposure to rising interest rates is by calculating the estimated impact of interest rate shocks immediate changes in rates at varying levels 
table xv in item a presents information regarding the estimated impact of immediate interest rate shocks of basis points  basis points and basis points on net interest income and on the market value of portfolio equity 
the corporation benefited in from a relatively low by historical standards provision for loan losses 
issues related to larger commercial borrowers can significantly affect the corporation s provision for loan losses in any particular period 
accordingly  the amount of loan loss provision for will depend substantially on the credit status of the commercial portfolio 
although management is concerned about the condition of the national economy and the potential for problems in our market area  to date the corporation has not experienced significant deterioration in loan delinquencies  or a noticeable change in volume of activity related to troubled loans or foreclosures 
the corporation has not originated interest only mortgages  loans without documentation of the borrowers sources of income or net worth  or other types of subprime mortgage loans that have received negative publicity 
however  if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  the corporation may need to increase the provision for loan losses for the impact on the residential mortgage and consumer portions of the loan portfolio 
as referenced above  the corporation implemented a new overdraft privilege program in  and has recognized significant increases in non interest income in and as compared to income from its prior overdraft process 
total revenue from overdrafts  net of waived or refunded fees and provision for charge offs  amounted to  in legislative and regulatory changes will affect the overdraft privilege program in the second half of  as customers will be required to affirmatively document their consent to be assessed overdraft fees for atm and one time point of sale transactions 
also  potential legislative changes could limit the corporation s ability to pay overdrafts and assess fees for all these types of transactions 
management cannot currently estimate the extent of reduction in revenue that could occur in the second half of as a result of these regulatory and potential legislative changes 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  in january  the corporation issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to the united states department of the treasury under the tarp program 
the corporation sold the preferred stock and warrant for an aggregate price of  the preferred stock pays a cumulative dividend rate of per annum for the first five years and will reset to a rate of per annum after year five 
pursuant to participation in the tarp program  the corporation may continue to pay dividends on its common stock  subject to the following requirements and limitations all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods on the preferred stock issued to the treasury must be fully paid  and consent of the treasury is required for any increase over per quarter in the per share dividends on common shares until january   unless prior to that date  the corporation has redeemed the preferred stock issued to the treasury in whole or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to third parties 
also  until january  unless prior to that date  the corporation has redeemed the preferred stock issued to the treasury in whole or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to third parties the treasury s consent is required for any repurchases of common stock  except for repurchases of shares in connection with employee benefit plans in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice 
management is considering redemption of the preferred stock in  however  our ability to do so is dependent upon approval from banking regulatory authorities and the treasury 
in  the corporation issued approximately  shares of common stock  raising a total of  net of related offering costs 
of this total   shares were issued at a price of per share in a public offering that was completed in december  and which resulted in net proceeds of  included in the  for the year 
the additional  was raised through issuance of shares under the corporation s dividend reinvestment plan 
although the corporation maintained capital ratios that exceeded regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized throughout  the additional capital provides flexibility to absorb any additional  unexpected securities losses or other economic issues that might arise 
further  management believes the additional capital increases the likelihood the corporation will be able to repay the tarp preferred stock in  which would reduce ongoing preferred stock dividend costs  and improves the corporation s ability to respond to any opportunities that could arise for branch or full bank acquisitions 
more information related to regulatory capital is provided in the stockholder s equity and capital adequacy section of management s discussion and analysis 
management estimates total capital purchases for to be approximately million  with computer software and hardware the largest planned categories of expenditure 
in comparison  total capital purchases totaled  in   in and  in management does not expect capital expenditures to have a material  detrimental effect on the corporation s financial condition in the year ending december  critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable 
the corporation s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is described in a separate section later in management s discussion and analysis 
given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses  it is likely that well informed individuals could make materially different assumptions  and could  therefore calculate a materially different allowance value 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the corporation s debt securities 
for most of the corporation s debt securities  the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service  or from brokers 
in developing fair values  the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows  based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments 
based on experience  management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services 
accordingly  when selling debt securities  management typically obtains price quotes from more than one source 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the corporation changed its method of valuing pooled trust preferred securities from using price quotes received from pricing services  to a level as described in the fasb accounting standards codification the asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures methodology  using discounted cash flows 
at both december  and december   management calculated the fair values of pooled trust preferred securities by applying discount rates to estimated cash flows for each security 
management estimated the cash flows expected to be received from each security  taking into account estimated levels of deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuers  and used discount rates considered reflective of a market participant s expectations regarding the extent of credit and liquidity risk inherent in the securities 
management s estimates of cash flows and discount rates used to calculate fair values of pooled trust preferred securities were based on sensitive assumptions  and use of different assumptions could result in calculations of fair values that would be substantially different than the amounts calculated by management 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management evaluates securities for otti 
in making that evaluation  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether the corporation intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
management s assessments of the likelihood and potential for recovery in value of securities are subjective and based on sensitive assumptions 
also  management s estimates of cash flows used to evaluate other than temporary impairment of pooled trust preferred securities are based on sensitive assumptions  and use of different assumptions could produce different conclusions for each security 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes details concerning significant changes made at september   as compared to the previous four quarterly analyses  that resulted in increased amounts of estimated future defaults on pooled trust preferred securities 
net interest margin the corporation s primary source of operating income is represented by the net interest margin 
the net interest margin is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense 
tables i  ii and iii include information regarding the corporation s net interest margin in  and in each of these tables  the amounts of interest income earned on tax exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
accordingly  the net interest margin amounts presented in these tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion that follows is based on amounts in the tables

interest income totaled  in  a decrease of from income from available for sale securities decreased   while interest and fees from loans decreased  or 
as indicated in table ii  total average available for sale securities at amortized cost in fell to  a decrease of  or from during  the corporation increased the size of its tax exempt municipal security portfolio  while shrinking the taxable available for sale securities portfolio 
the corporation s yield on taxable securities fell in primarily because of low market interest rates  including the effects of management s decision to limit purchases of taxable securities to investments that mature or are expected to repay a substantial portion of principal within approximately four years or less 
also  interest rates on variable rate trust preferred securities decreased consistent with short term global interest rates 
the average rate of return on available for sale securities was for and in the average balance of gross loans decreased to  in from  in due to the challenging economic environment  the corporation experienced contraction in the balance of its mortgage and consumer loan portfolios  with slight growth in average commercial and tax exempt loan balances

the average rate on borrowed funds was in  down from in this change primarily reflects lower rates being paid on customer repurchase agreements  which make up most of the corporation s short term borrowed funds 
as presented in table ii  the interest rate spread excess of average rate of return on interest bearing assets over average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities was in  up significantly from in as shown in table iii  changes in volume decreased net interest income by  and changes in rates increased net interest income by  the most significant components of changes in volume were decreases of  in interest and fees on loans and  in interest expense on borrowed funds 
the most significant components of changes in rates were decreases of  in income on taxable available for sale securities   in interest and fees on loans  and  in interest expense on deposits 
vs 
in may  the corporation acquired citizens bancorp  inc included in this acquisition were all loans and deposits of citizens trust company  its banking subsidiary 
at the date of acquisition  the corporation recorded an increase of  in net loans and  in total deposits 
in december  management entered into a significant leveraged investment purchase transaction for two purposes to generate incremental positive net interest income  and to reduce the magnitude of the corporation s reduction in net interest income if interest rates rise significantly within the next few years 
specifically  the corporation purchased mortgage backed securities and a collateralized mortgage obligation for a total cost of approximately  which was funded mainly by two repurchase agreements borrowings of  each 
the weighted average initial book yield on the securities was 
the borrowings have a weighted average interest rate of  and mature in one of the borrowings is putable by the issuer at quarterly intervals starting in december  and the other is putable quarterly starting in december each of these borrowings contains an embedded cap  providing that on the quarterly anniversary of the transaction settlement date  if three month libor is higher than  the corporation s interest rate payable will decrease by twice the amount of the excess  down to a minimum rate of 
the embedded caps expire on the initial put dates in and since the corporation executed this transaction  three month libor has not exceeded  and the embedded caps have not provided any reduction to overall interest expense 
the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was  in   higher than in as shown in table iii  net increases in volume had the effect of increasing net interest income  and interest rate changes had the effect of increasing net interest income  increases in volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were significantly affected by the acquisition of citizens bancorp as well as the leveraged investment purchase discussed above 
the most significant components of the volume changes in were an increase of  in interest income attributable to growth in the securities portfolio  an increase in interest income of  attributable to loan growth  and an increase in interest expense of  attributable to growth in long term borrowings

in  the provision for income tax was  or of pre tax income  and in  the provision for income tax was  or of pre tax income 
fluctuations in the tax provision pre tax income rate for these periods include the impact of changes in the average holdings of tax exempt securities and loans 
the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
at december   the net deferred tax asset was million  up from a balance of approximately million at december  the increase in net deferred tax asset resulted mainly from other than temporary impairment losses on securities for financial reporting purposes  which are not currently deductible for federal income tax reporting purposes 
the net deferred tax asset balance at december  attributable to realized securities losses was million  exclusive of a valuation allowance of  the corporation regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based on history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences 
realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income  including taxable income in prior carryback years  as well as future taxable income 
of the total deferred tax asset from realized losses on securities  a portion is from securities that  if the corporation were to sell them  would be classified as capital losses for income tax reporting purposes 
the valuation allowance at december  reflects the excess of the tax benefit that would be generated from selling all of the capital assets  over the amount that could be realized from available carryback and offset against capital gains generated in and realization of the remaining  of tax benefits associated with capital assets is dependent upon realization of future capital gains 
after adjustment for the valuation allowance on capital assets  management believes the recorded net deferred tax asset at december  is fully realizable  however  if management determines the corporation will be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset  the corporation would adjust the deferred tax asset  which would negatively impact earnings 
a more complete analysis of income taxes is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition significant changes in the average balances of the corporation s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are described in the net interest margin section of management s discussion and analysis 
that discussion provides useful information regarding changes in the corporation s balance sheet over the year period ended december   including discussions of available for sale securities  loans  deposits and borrowings 
other significant balance sheet items the allowance for loan losses and stockholders equity are discussed in separate sections of management s discussion and analysis 
other assets increased significantly at december   to  from  at december  included in other assets at december  were two large amounts that were not recurring from the prior year estimated balance receivable for income taxes paid in  as well as carry back for recovery of some tax paid for  totaling million  and prepayment of fdic assessments totaling million  representing the fdic s estimate of premiums for the next three years 
table vi shows the composition of the investment portfolio at december   and comparison of the amortized cost totals of available for sale securities at each year end presented reflects an increase from  at december  to  at december  followed by a reduction of  to  at december  in  the main increases were in mortgage backed securities and municipal bonds 
in  the corporation shrank its available for sale investment portfolio through a combination of sales  not reinvesting cash flow from amortizing securities  and recognition of otti on certain securities 
this overall contraction was partially offset by purchases of agency bonds  agency collateralized mortgage obligations  and municipal bonds with relatively short expected lives 
changes in the investment portfolio are discussed in more detail in the net interest margin section of management s discussion and analysis 
as discussed in more detail in note to the financial statements  the corporation reported realized losses from available for sale securities of  including the effect of other than temporary impairment write downs of pooled trust preferred securities by  equity securities by  trust preferred securities issued by individual institutions by  and collateralized mortgage obligations by  management has reviewed the corporation s holdings as of december   and concluded that with the exception of the securities that have been written down through earnings the remaining unrealized losses are considered temporary 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide more detail concerning the corporation s processes for evaluating securities for other than temporary impairment  and for valuation of trust preferred securities 
management will continue to closely monitor the status of impaired securities in the total of loans outstanding without consideration of the allowance for loan losses has slowed in with total growth of  from the balance at december  to the total outstanding of  at december  of the total increase   came from balances acquired from citizens bancorp  inc 
excluding the effects of the acquisition  total loans fell in  grew slightly in  fell slightly in  and grew in loan volumes are heavily dependent on economic conditions in the corporation s market area  and are significantly influenced by interest rates 
prior to  the corporation experienced overall growth in commercial and consumer mortgage lending over the previous years 
in  the corporation experienced a net decrease in residential mortgage loans  with more residential mortgage originations than in previous years sold into the secondary market 
also  in the last two years  consumer loans have decreased  to the december  balance of  the corporation has not originated interest only mortgages  loans without documentation of the borrowers sources of income or net worth  or other types of exotic mortgage loans that have made headlines in recent years  and which have led some lenders and investors to realize significant losses from these types of instruments 
table viii presents loan maturity data as of november  the last date in for which the corporation ran the interest rate simulation model used to generate the loan maturities information included in table viii 
the interest rate simulation model classifies certain loans under different categories than they appear in table vii 
fixed rate loans are included in table viii based on their contractually scheduled principal repayments  while variable rate loans are included based on contractual principal repayments  with the remaining balance reflected in the table as of the date of the next change in rate 
table viii shows that approximately of the loan portfolio is fixed rate 
of the of the portfolio made up of variable rate loans  a significant portion will re price after more than one year 
variable rate loans re pricing after more than one year include significant amounts of residential and commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s substantial investment in long term  fixed rate loans and variable rate loans with extended periods until re pricing is one of the major concerns management attempts to address through interest rate risk management practices

the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
in evaluating collectability  management considers a number of factors  including the status of specific impaired loans  trends in historical loss experience  delinquency trends  credit concentrations  and economic conditions within the corporation s market area 
allowances for impaired loans are determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense  and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
there are two major components of the allowance fasb accounting standards codification the asc topic formerly sfas allowances on larger loans  mainly commercial purpose  determined on a loan by loan basis  and asc topic formerly sfas allowances estimates of losses incurred on the remainder of the portfolio  determined based on collective evaluation of impairment for various categories of loans 
fasb asc allowances include a portion based on historical net charge off experience  and a portion based on evaluation of qualitative factors 
each quarter  management performs a detailed assessment of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
a management committee referred to as the watch list committee performs this assessment 
quarterly  the watch list committee and the applicable lenders discuss each loan relationship under review  and reach a consensus on the appropriate fasb asc estimated loss amount for the quarter 
the watch list committee s focus is on ensuring that all pertinent facts have been considered  and that the fasb asc loss amounts are reasonable 
the assessment process includes review of certain loans reported on the watch list 
all loans  which lenders or the credit administration staff has assigned a risk rating of special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss  are included in the watch list 
the scope of loans evaluated individually for impairment fasb asc evaluation include all loan relationships greater than  for c n bank loans  and  for first state bank  for which there is at least one extension of credit graded special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
also  loan relationships less than  in the aggregate  but with an estimated loss of  or more  are individually evaluated for impairment 
since  the banks risk management personnel performed annual  independent credit reviews of large credit relationships 
in prior years  outside consulting firms were retained to perform such functions 
management gives substantial consideration to the classifications and recommendations of the credit reviewers in determining the allowance for loan losses 
the fasb asc component of the allowance includes estimates of losses incurred on loans that have not been individually evaluated for impairment 
management uses loan categories included in the call report a quarterly report filed by fdic insured banks to identify categories of loans with similar risk characteristics  and multiplies the loan balances for each category as of each quarter end by two different factors to determine the fasb asc allowance amounts 
these two factors are based on historical net charge off experience  and qualitative factors 
the sum of the allowance amounts calculated for each risk category  including both the amount based on historical net charge off experience and the amount based on evaluation of qualitative factors  is equal to the total fasb asc component of the allowance 
the historical net charge off portion of the fasb asc allowance component is calculated by the accounting department as of the end of the applicable quarter 
for each loan classification category used in the call report  the accounting department multiplies the outstanding balance as of the quarter end excluding loans individually evaluated for impairment by the ratio of net charge offs to average quarterly loan balances for the previous three calendar years 
prior to the fourth quarter  c n bank had utilized the ratio of net charge offs to average balances over a five year period in calculating the historical loan loss experience portion of the allowance portfolio 
management made the change to the three year assumption  which had very little effect on the allowance valuation as of december   mainly because management believes net charge off experience over a year period may be more representative of losses existing in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
management also calculates the effects of specific qualitative factors criteria to determine a percentage increase or decrease in the fasb asc allowance  in relation to the historical net charge off percentage 
the qualitative factors analysis involves assessment of changes in factors affecting the portfolio  to provide for estimated differences between losses currently inherent in the portfolio and the amounts determined based on recent historical loss rates and from identification of losses on specific individual loans 
a management committee referred to as the qualitative factors committee meets quarterly  near the end of the final month of each quarter 
the qualitative factors committee discusses several qualitative factors  including economic conditions  lending policies  changes in the portfolio  risk profile of the portfolio  competition and regulatory requirements  and other factors  with consideration given to how the factors affect three distinct parts of the loan portfolio commercial  mortgage and consumer 
during or soon after completion of the meeting  each member of the committee prepares an update to his or her recommended percentage adjustment for each qualitative factor  and average qualitative factor adjustments are calculated for commercial  mortgage and consumer loans 
the accounting department multiplies the outstanding balance as of the quarter end excluding loans individually evaluated for impairment by the applicable qualitative factor percentages  to determine the portion of the fasb asc allowance attributable to qualitative factors 
average qualitative factors used in calculating the fasb asc portion of the allowance did not change significantly by more than a few basis points for any category over the course of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses table table x includes the fasb asc component of the allowance on the line item called impaired loans 
fasb asc estimated losses  including both the portion determined based on historical net charge off results  as well as the portion based on management s assessment of qualitative factors  are allocated in table x to the applicable categories of commercial  consumer mortgage and consumer loans 
as of december   the fasb asc valuation allowance on impaired loans includes  related to two unrelated commercial relationships 
table x reflects an allowance on commercial loans of  at december  comparable to the  at december  the large increase from  at december   is mainly associated with an increase in the fasb asc allowance attributable to growth of the commercial sector 
the allowance for loan losses was  at december  up from  at december   though in line with the balances of  at december  and  at december  as shown in table ix  net charge offs in of  were down substantially from  in net charge offs in were substantially higher by comparison than other recent historical levels of  in and  in the increase in net charge offs for included  attributed to four large commercial relationships that had been classified as impaired at december  table ix also shows the provision for loan losses decreased to  in from  in  and favorable to the five year average of  the total amount of the provision for loan losses for each year is determined based on the amount required to maintain an appropriate allowance in light of all of the factors described above 
table xi presents information related to past due and impaired loans 
as of december   total impaired loans amounted to  which represents a small increase from  in  though down from previous year levels of  in   in and  in nonaccrual loans increased to  at december   the highest level within the last five years  from  at december  primarily due to the recent addition of a few larger commercial relationships 
over the period  each period includes a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts 
as a result  a limited number of relationships may significantly impact category fluctuations within table xi 
management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans  estimates of loss  and nonaccrual status  however  the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of december  management continues to closely monitor its commercial loan relationships for possible credit losses  and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status  if appropriate

liquidity liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable cost 
an adequate liquidity position permits the corporation to pay creditors  compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations and fund unexpected loan demand 
at december   the corporation maintained overnight interest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia and other correspondent banks totaling the corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several correspondent banks that provide a source of day to day liquidity 
also  the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  secured by various mortgage loans 
the corporation has a line of credit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s discount window 
management intends to use this line of credit as a contingency funding source

additionally  the corporation uses repurchase agreements placed with brokers to borrow funds secured by investment assets  and uses reposweep arrangements to borrow funds from commercial banking customers on an overnight basis 
if required to raise cash in an emergency situation  the corporation could sell non pledged investment securities to meet its obligations 
at december   the carrying value of non pledged available for sale securities was  management believes the corporation is well positioned to meet its short term and long term obligations 
stockholders equity and capital adequacy the corporation and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
details concerning the corporation s and the banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as reflected in note  at december  and  the ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average total assets are well in excess of regulatory capital requirements 
in january  the corporation issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to the united states department of the treasury under the tarp program 
the corporation sold the preferred stock and warrant for an aggregate price of  the preferred stock pays a cumulative dividend rate of per annum for the first five years and will reset to a rate of per annum after year five 
pursuant to participation in the tarp program  the corporation may continue to pay dividends on its common stock  subject to the following requirements and limitations all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods on the preferred stock issued to the treasury must be fully paid  and consent of the treasury is required for any increase over per quarter in the per share dividends on common shares until january   unless prior to that date  the corporation has redeemed the preferred stock issued to the treasury in whole or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to third parties 
also  until january  unless prior to that date  the corporation has redeemed the preferred stock issued to the treasury in whole or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to third parties the treasury s consent is required for any repurchases of common stock  except for repurchases of shares in connection with employee benefit plans in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice 
management is considering redemption of the preferred stock in  however  our ability to do so is dependent upon approval from banking regulatory authorities and the treasury 
in  the corporation issued approximately  shares of common stock  raising a total of  net of related offering costs 
of this total   shares were issued at a price of per share in a public offering that was completed in december  and which resulted in net proceeds of  included in the  for the year 
the additional  was raised through the issuance of shares under our dividend reinvestment plan 
although the corporation maintained capital ratios that exceeded regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized throughout  the additional capital provides flexibility to absorb any additional  unexpected securities losses or other economic issues that might arise 
further  management believes the additional capital increases the likelihood the corporation will be able to repay the tarp preferred stock in  which would reduce ongoing preferred stock dividend costs  and improves the corporation s ability to respond to any opportunities that could arise for branch or full bank acquisitions 
future dividend payments will depend upon maintenance of a strong financial condition  future earnings and capital and regulatory requirements 
in addition to the restrictions imposed by participation in tarp described above  the corporation  c n bank and first state bank are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be paid without approval of banking regulatory authorities 
these restrictions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also  under guidance issued in by the federal reserve  until further notice the corporation must consult the federal reserve before declaring dividends on either common or preferred stock 
the corporation s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of available for sale securities 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  amounted to  at december  and  at december  changes in accumulated other comprehensive income are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity 
if available for sale securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  unrealized losses are recorded as a charge against earnings  and amortized cost for the affected securities is reduced 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information concerning management s evaluation of available for sale securities for other than temporary impairment at december  stockholders equity is also affected by the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to underfunded defined benefit plans  net of deferred income tax  was  at december  and  at december  comprehensive income loss comprehensive income or loss is a measure of the change in equity of a corporation  excluding transactions with owners in their capacity as owners such as proceeds from issuances of stock and dividends 
the difference between net income and comprehensive income is termed other comprehensive income loss 
comprehensive income or loss should not be construed to be a measure of net income 
for the corporation  other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax 
the amount of unrealized gains or losses reflected in comprehensive income may vary widely from period to period  depending on the financial markets as a whole and how the portfolio of available for sale securities is affected by interest rate movements 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit plans is also included in other comprehensive income 
in  total comprehensive loss was  while in total comprehensive loss was  and in total comprehensive income was  other comprehensive income loss amounted to  in   in and  in inflation the corporation is significantly affected by the federal reserve board s efforts to control inflation through changes in short term interest rates 
beginning in september  in response to concerns about weakness in the us economy  the federal reserve lowered the fed funds target rate numerous times  in december  it took the unusual step of establishing a target range of to  which it has maintained through the end of also  the federal reserve has injected massive amounts of liquidity into the nation s monetary system through a variety of programs 
the current low short term rate environment and liquidity injections could  in the future  lead to inflationary pressures which would force the fed to change course and begin raising rates  which management would expect to be adverse to the corporation s cost of funds and net interest margin 
although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation  management monitors the impact of economic trends  including any indicators of inflationary pressures  in managing interest rate and other financial risks 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and their recent or potential future effects on the corporation s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices of the corporation s financial instruments 
in addition to the effects of interest rates  the market prices of the corporation s debt securities within the available for sale securities portfolio are affected by fluctuations in the risk premiums amounts of spread over risk free rates demanded by investors 
management cannot control changes in market prices of securities based on fluctuations in the risk premiums demanded by investors  nor can management control the volume of deferrals or defaults by other entities on trust preferred securities 
however  management attempts to limit the risk that economic conditions would force the corporation to sell securities for realized losses by maintaining a strong capital position discussed in the stockholders equity and capital adequacy section of management s discussion and analysis and ample sources of liquidity discussed in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis 
the corporation s two major categories of market risk are interest rate risk and equity securities risk  which are discussed in the following sections 
interest rate risk business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a bank 
the corporation s assets are predominantly long term  fixed rate loans and debt securities 
funding for these assets comes principally from shorter term deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change 
the corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity 
for purposes of these calculations  the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments  such as securities  loans  deposits and borrowed funds  and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses 
the model measures and projects potential changes in net interest income  and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments  assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus basis points of current rates 
the corporation s board of directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk  based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the policy provides limits at  and basis points from current rates for fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline flat rates one year scenario 
the policy also limits acceptable market value variances from the baseline values based on current rates 
table xv  which follows this discussion  is based on the results of the simulation model as of november  and november  the figures include a pro forma adjustment to increase equity by  which represents the proceeds received from the corporation s sale of common stock in december net of issuance costs 
the table also includes pro forma adjustments to reflect the corporation s december purchases of several investment securities that were consistent with management s decision to limit purchases of taxable securities to investments that mature or are expected to repay a substantial portion of principal within approximately four years or less 
the securities purchased totaled approximately  and included obligations of us government agencies and a collateralized mortgage obligation issued by a us government agency 
as indicated in the table  the corporation is liability sensitive  and therefore net interest income and market value generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise 
the table shows that as of november   the changes in net interest income and changes in market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios 
as of november   the changes in net interest income were within the policy limits in all scenarios  and changes in market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios except an immediate rate increase of basis points 
in december  the corporation entered into repurchase agreements borrowings totaling million to fund the purchase of investment securities 
in addition to generating positive earnings from the spread of the return on the investment securities over the current cost of the borrowings  the transaction reduces the magnitude of the corporation s overall liability sensitive position 
specifically  the borrowings include embedded caps providing that  if month libor were to exceed  the interest rate payable on the repurchase agreements would fall  down to a minimum of  based on parameters included in the repurchase agreements 
the embedded cap on one of the million borrowings expires in december  and the embedded cap on the other million borrowing expires in december three month libor has not exceeded since the embedded caps were acquired  therefore  they have not affected interest expense to date 
the month libor was at november  and at november  since the embedded caps are effective only when month libor exceeds  the corporation would be unable to realize an interest expense reduction in any scenario at november and would be unable to realize an interest expense reduction in any scenario at november except an immediate rate increase of basis points 
the model makes estimates  at each level of interest rate change  regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and call activity on other investment securities 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates  which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest margin and market value of portfolio equity 
also  the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition  and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates

investments in bank stocks are subject to risk factors that affect the banking industry in general  including credit risk  competition from non bank entities  interest rate risk and other factors  which could result in a decline in market prices 
also  losses could occur in individual stocks held by the corporation because of specific circumstances related to each bank 
most us bank stock values fell significantly during late and as discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements  the corporation recognized otti charges on bank stocks totaling  during during the fourth quarter of  management decided to sell some bank stocks and liquidate the corporation s portfolio of non bank equity securities and mutual funds 
this decision was made primarily to generate capital losses  which could be carried back and offset against capital gains generated in  and to realize tax refunds 
as a result of these sales  the corporation s aggregate exposure to equities is significantly lower than in prior periods

table xiv presents quantitative data concerning the effects of a decline in fair value of the corporation s equity securities of or
