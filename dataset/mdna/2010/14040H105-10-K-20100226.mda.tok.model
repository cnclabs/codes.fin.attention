enterprise risk management capital one s policy is to identify  assess  and mitigate risks that affect or have the potential to affect our business  to target financial returns commensurate with the company s risk appetite  and to avoid excessive risk taking 
we follow three key principles related to this policy 
individual businesses take and manage risk in pursuit of strategic  financial  and other business objectives independent risk management organizations support individual businesses by providing risk management tools and policies  and by aggregating risks  in some cases  risks are managed centrally the board of directors and top management review our aggregate risk position and establish the risk appetite our approach is reflected in four critical risk management practices of particular importance in today s environment 
first  we recognize liquidity risk as among the critical risks facing financial institutions today 
we seek to mitigate this risk strategically and tactically 
from a strategic perspective  we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio 
from a tactical perspective  we have accumulated a very large liquidity reserve comprising cash  high quality  unencumbered securities  and committed collateralized credit lines and conduit facilities 
second  we recognize that credit issues are a frequent cause of financial institution stress and that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality 
consequently  we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns 
our most important tool is sound underwriting  using what we deem to be conservative assumptions 
in unsecured consumer loan underwriting  we assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are significantly higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting 
in commercial underwriting  we insist on strong cash flow  strong collateral  and strong covenants and guarantees 
in addition to conservative underwriting  we aggressively monitor our portfolio and aggressively collect or work out distressed loans 
third  we recognize that reputational risk is of particular concern in today s turbulent environment 
consequently  our ceo and executive team manage both tactical and strategic reputation issues and build our relationships with the government  media  and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both capital one and our industry 
this includes taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry and  where possible  unilaterally implementing those practices in our business 
finally  we recognize that maintaining appropriate capital levels is a concern in today s environment 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital  for further information regarding capital 
risk management roles and responsibilities the board of directors is responsible for establishing capital one s overall risk framework  approving and overseeing execution of the enterprise risk management policy and key risk category policies  establishing the company s risk appetite  and regularly reviewing capital one s risk profile 
the chief risk officer  who reports to the ceo  is responsible for overseeing capital one s risk management program and driving appropriate action to resolve any weaknesses 
the risk management program begins with a set of policies and risk appetites approved by the board that are implemented through a system of risk committees and senior executive risk stewards 
the company has established risk committees at both the corporate and divisional level to identify and manage risk 
in addition  we have assigned a senior executive expert to each of eight risk categories the risk stewards 
these executive risk stewards work with the chief risk officer and the risk committees to ensure that risks are identified and given appropriate priority and attention 
the chief risk officer aggregates the results of these processes to assemble a view of the company s risk profile 
both management and the board regularly review the risk profile 
risk management and control framework capital one uses a consistent framework to manage risk 
the framework applies at all levels  from the development of the enterprise risk management program itself to the tactical operations of the front line business team 
the framework has six key elements objective setting  risk assessment  control activities  communication and information  
table of contents program monitoring  and organization and culture 
objective setting is at the beginning of our risk management approach 
we set strategic  financial  operational  and other objectives during our strategic and annual planning processes and throughout the year 
these objectives cascade through the organization to individual teams of associates 
risk assessment is the process of identifying risks to our objectives  evaluating the impact of those risks and choosing a response 
responses include avoidance  mitigation  or acceptance 
risk responses are guided by our established risk appetite 
in certain risk categories  risk assessment is largely conducted by central risk groups or jointly between business areas and central groups market  liquidity  legal  credit  compliance 
in other risk categories  risk assessment is primarily the responsibility of business areas with more limited central support strategic  operational  reputation 
control activities are the day to day backbone of our enterprise risk management program 
controls provide reasonable assurance that financial accounting and reporting  legal  regulatory  and business requirements are met  and identified risks are being mitigated  avoided  or accepted according to our risk appetite 
we have practices in place to ensure key controls are established  evaluated  and effective in preventing a breakdown 
control activities include the monitoring of adherence to current requirements  regular reporting to management  and regular reviews and sign offs 
they also include the resolution of regulatory and audit findings and issues and the procedures that trigger objective setting and risk assessments when new business opportunities are evaluated or business hierarchy changes occur 
communication and information must provide a solid infrastructure to support the objective setting  risk assessment  and control activities described above 
we have established policies for each risk category which define the specific reports to be used and the communication infrastructure 
robust risk management requires well functioning communication channels to inform associates of their responsibilities  alert them to issues or changes that might affect their activities  and to enable an open flow of information up  down  and across the company 
program monitoring is critical to the enterprise risk management program itself because it assesses the accuracy  sufficiency  and effectiveness of current objectives  risk assessments  controls  ownership  communication  and management support 
where deficiencies are discovered  the enterprise risk management program must be updated to resolve the deficiencies in a timely manner 
clear accountability must also be defined when resolving deficiencies to ensure the desired outcome is achieved 
risk management programs are monitored at every level  from the overall enterprise risk management program to the individual risk management activities in each business area 
our organization and culture promote risk management as a key factor in making important business decisions 
an effective risk management culture starts with a well defined risk management philosophy 
it requires established risk management objectives that align to business objectives and make targeted risk management activities part of ongoing business management activities 
we have a corporate code of business conduct and ethics the code available on the corporate governance page of our website at www 
capitalone 
com about under which each associate is obligated to behave with integrity in dealing with customers and business partners and to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
we disclose any waivers to the code on our website 
we also have an associate performance management process that emphasizes achieving business results while ensuring integrity  compliance  and sound business management 
our risk management culture is also encouraged through frequent direction and communications from the board of directors  senior leadership  corporate and departmental risk management policies  risk management and compliance training programs and on going risk assessment activities in the business areas 
risk appetite capital one organizes its enterprise risk management program around eight risk categories 
the risk categories enable us to efficiently aggregate risks  provide a mechanism to discuss risk appetite  and facilitate the assignment of expert risk resources to support our business activities 
we customize specific risk objectives and control methodologies to each risk category  they share  at the highest level  a common approach to describing and measuring risk appetite 
risk appetites are approved by the board of directors and are used both to monitor the company s evolving risk position and to guide strategic and tactical decision making 
risk categories capital one s risk management program is organized around eight risk categories 
they are liquidity risk is the risk that future financial obligations are not met or future asset growth cannot occur because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time 
the chief financial officer is the accountable executive for liquidity risk 

table of contents liquidity strength is assessed through balance sheet metrics  and stress testing is used to ensure that capital one can withstand significant degradation in the funding markets particularly in the wholesale funding markets 
we regularly evaluate our liquidity position under various liquidity stress scenarios with management s asset liability management committee and the finance and trust oversight committee of the board  providing recommendations for any necessary actions to ensure our liquidity risk exposure is well managed 
management reports liquidity metrics to the finance and trust oversight committee no less than quarterly 
breaches in liquidity policy limits are reported to the treasurer as soon as they are identified and to the asset liability management committee at the next regularly scheduled committee meeting  unless said breach activates the liquidity contingency plan 
breaches are also reported to the finance and trust oversight committee no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting 
detailed processes  requirements and controls are contained in our policies and supporting procedures 
credit risk is the risk of loss from a borrower s failure to meet the terms of any contract or failure to otherwise perform as agreed

management is authorized to utilize financial instruments to actively manage market risk exposure 
detailed processes  requirements and controls are contained in our policies and supporting procedures

the chief executive officer and other senior executives spend significant time throughout the entire company sharing the company s strategic imperatives to promote an understanding of our strategy and connect it to day to day associate activities to enable effective execution 
division presidents are accountable for defining business strategy within the context of the overall corporate level strategy and strategic imperatives 
business strategies are integrated into the corporate strategic plan and are reviewed and approved separately and together on an annual basis by the chief executive officer and the board of directors

table of contents while most operational risks are managed and controlled by business areas  the operational risk management program establishes requirements and control processes that assure certain consistent practices in the management of operational risk  and provides transparency to the corporate operational risk profile 
our operational risk management program also includes two primary additional functions 
operational risk reporting involves independent assessments of the control and sustainability of key business processes at a corporate and business area level  and such assessments are provided to the chief risk officer  management s risk management committee  and the audit and risk committee of the board

table of contents funding and liquidity a discussion of our funding programs and liquidity has been included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and funding 
competition as a diversified financial institution that markets credit cards and consumer and commercial financial products and services  we face intense competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non bank providers of financial services 
we compete with national and state banks for deposits  commercial loans and trust accounts and with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits 
we also compete with other financial services providers for loans  deposits  and other services and products 
in addition  we compete against non depository institutions that are able to offer products and services that were typically banking products and services 
in general  in the current economic environment  customers are attracted to depository institutions that are perceived as stable  with solid liquidity and funding 
we compete with international  national  regional and local issuers of visa and mastercard credit cards  as well as with american express  discover card and  to a certain extent  debit cards 
in general  customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price  credit limit and other product features  and customer loyalty is often limited 
in our auto finance business  we face competition from banks and non bank lenders who provide financing for dealer originated loans 
we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our current markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop  or by the broader economic environment 
for a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment  please refer to item a 
risk factors we face intense competition in all of our markets 
intellectual property as part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property  we rely on a variety of protections  including copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and certain restrictions on disclosure and competition 
we also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization 
our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information 
in addition  our competitors also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry 
the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete 
conversely  our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts  or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results 
employees a central part of our philosophy is to attract and retain a highly capable staff 
as of december   we employed approximately  employees  whom we refer to as associates  and almost  of whom were formerly employees of chevy chase bank 
we view current associate relations to be satisfactory  and none of our associates is covered under a collective bargaining agreement

risk factors 
dividends and transfers of funds traditionally dividends to the company from its direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for the company to pay dividends on its stock  make payments on corporate debt securities and meet its other obligations 
there are various federal and state law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to the company through dividends and loans 
these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements  federal and state banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus  sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates  as well as general federal and state regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
in general  federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit  without first obtaining regulatory approval  insured depository institutions  such as the banks  from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards 
however  we expect that the company may receive a material amount of its funding in the form of dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
capital adequacy the banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by federal banking regulators 
for a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section x 
capital and note regulatory matters 
the banks were well capitalized under these guidelines as of december  basel ii implementation of the international accord on revised risk based capital rules known as basel ii continues to progress 
us federal banking regulators finalized the advanced version of basel ii in december and they issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for the standardized version in june in december  the basel committee on banking supervision released a proposal for additional capital and liquidity requirements  though it is not clear how these proposals will impact current regulations 
neither the advanced nor standardized version is mandatory for the company  but the advanced version could become so  due to growth in the company s reported assets 
alternatively  the company might elect to comply with either the advanced or standardized versions of basel ii in the future 
application of the new capital rules could require us to increase the minimum level of capital that we hold 
compliance might also require a material investment of resources 
we will continue to closely monitor regulators implementation of the new rules with respect to the large institutions that are subject to it and assess the potential impact to us 
deposits and deposit insurance each of the banks  as an insured depository institution  is a member of the deposit insurance fund dif maintained by the fdic 
through the dif  the fdic insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the dif was formed on march   upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act 
the reform act permits the fdic to set a designated reserve ratio drr for the dif 
to maintain the dif  member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium and the fdic may take action to increase insurance premiums if the drr falls below its required level 
the fdic has established a plan to restore the dif in the face of recent insurance losses and future loss projections 
as such  in the past year  the fdic has issued rules that generally increase deposit insurance rates and are expected to improve risk differentiation so that riskier institutions bear a greater share of insurance premiums 
as part of the restoration plan  the fdic imposed a five basis point special assessment on a bank s assets minus its tier capital as of june  the fdic recently increased annual assessment rates again by three basis points beginning the fdic also recently issued a final rule that required banks to prepay on december  their estimated quarterly risk based assessment for the fourth quarter of and for   and in connection with the rule  the company has prepaid approximately million  which is included within other assets 
on october   the fdic announced its temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which included the transaction account guarantee program tagp 
the tagp provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts including accounts swept from a non interest bearing transaction account into a non interest bearing savings deposit account and certain interest bearing accounts negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts with interest rates of percent or less and lawyers trust accounts at fdic insured depository institutions 
the tagp was originally scheduled to expire on december   but was extended through june  for those institutions that choose to participate 
the banks are participating in the tagp extension 
extension assessment costs are an annualized basis point fee on the balance of each covered account in excess of the current fdic insurance limit of  
table of contents the fdic is authorized to terminate a bank s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the bank s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and its earnings 
banks may accept brokered deposits as part of their funding 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  as discussed in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section x 
capital  only well capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits 
adequately capitalized institutions  however  must first obtain a waiver from the fdic before accepting brokered deposits  and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institution s normal market area or  for deposits from outside the institution s normal market area  the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity 
overdraft protection the federal reserve amended regulation e on november   to limit the ability to assess overdraft fees for paying atm and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account  unless the consumer opts into such payment of overdrafts 
the new rule does not apply to overdraft services with respect to checks  ach transactions  or recurring debit card transactions  or to the payment of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit or a service that transfers funds from another account 
we are required to provide to customers written notice describing our overdraft service  fees imposed  and other information  and to provide customers with a reasonable opportunity to opt in to the service 
before we may assess fees for paying discretionary overdrafts  a customer must affirmatively opt in  which could negatively impact our deposit business revenue 
liability for commonly controlled institutions under the cross guarantee provision of the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea  insured depository institutions such as the banks may be liable to the fdic with respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred  by the fdic in connection with the default of  or fdic assistance to  any commonly controlled insured depository institution 
the banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the firrea cross guarantee provision 
ffiec account management guidance on january   the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec released account management and loss allowance guidance the guidance 
the guidance applies to all credit lending of regulated financial institutions and generally requires that banks properly manage several elements of their lending programs  including line assignments  over limit practices  minimum payment and negative amortization  workout and settlement programs  and the accounting methodology used for various assets and income items related to loans 
we believe that our account management and loss allowance practices are prudent and appropriate and  therefore  consistent with the guidance 
we caution  however  the guidance provides wide discretion to bank regulatory agencies in the application of the guidance to any particular institution and its account management and loss allowance practices 
accordingly  under the guidance  bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future  and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
privacy and fair credit reporting the gramm leach bliley act glba requires a financial institution to describe in a privacy notice certain of its privacy and data collection practices and requires that customers or consumers  before their nonpublic personal information is shared with nonaffiliated third parties  be given a choice through an opt out notice to limit the sharing of such information about them with nonaffiliated third persons unless the sharing is required or permitted under the glba as implemented 
the company and the banks have written privacy notices that are available through the website of the company  the relevant legal entity  or both  and are delivered to consumers and customers when required under the glba 
in accordance with the privacy notices noted above  the company and the banks protect the security of information about their customers  educate their employees about the importance of protecting customer privacy  and allow their customers to remove their names from the solicitation lists they use and share with others to the extent they use or share such lists 
the company and the banks require business partners with whom they share such information to have adequate security safeguards and to abide by the redisclosure and reuse provisions of the glba 
to the extent that the glba and the fcra require the company or one or more of the banks to provide customers and consumers the opportunity to opt out of sharing information  then the relevant entity or entities provide such options in the privacy notice 
in addition to adopting federal requirements regarding privacy  the glba also permits individual states to enact stricter laws relating to the use of customer information 
to date  at least california and vermont have done so by statute  regulation or referendum  and other states may consider proposals which impose additional requirements or restrictions on the company and or the banks 
if the federal or state regulators of the financial subsidiaries establish further guidelines for addressing customer privacy issues  the company and or one or more of the banks may need to amend their privacy policies and adapt their internal procedures

like other lending institutions  the banks utilize credit bureau data in their underwriting activities

if financial institutions and credit bureaus fail to alleviate the costs and consumer frustration associated with the growing crime of identity theft  financial institutions could face increased legislative regulatory and litigation risks

financial regulatory reform in june  the treasury department released the administration s proposal for regulatory reform 
this proposal overhauls the financial regulatory structure in several significant respects 
among other changes  the proposal would give authority to the federal reserve board to serve as the nation s financial services systemic risk regulator  with new enhanced scrutiny over financial institutions that are deemed too big to fail 
the administration s proposal would also establish a consumer financial protection agency cfpa  a new government agency with sole rule writing authority for consumer financial protection statutes 
as proposed  the cfpa s authority would cover all consumer financial products including any loan  deposit account or other financial product 
the proposal would also give states the authority to enforce federal laws regardless of a bank s charter  and it would abolish federal preemption of conflicting state consumer protection laws  requiring national banks to meet up to separate sets of standards 

table of contents in january  the president also proposed implementing volcker rule limitations that would place new restrictions on the size and scope of banks and other financial institutions 
specifically  no bank would be permitted to own  invest in or sponsor a hedge fund or a private equity fund  or proprietary trading operations unrelated to serving customers for its own profit and broader limits would be placed on increases in the market share of liabilities at the largest financial firms to supplement existing limitations with respect to the market share of deposits 
we do not expect that this proposed rule would affect any of our existing businesses 
on december   the house passed the wall street reform and consumer protection act the wall street reform act the legislation would create the cfpa and the new agency would have oversight over most consumer protection laws except the community reinvestment act days after the bill is enacted into law 
the wall street reform act allows for federal preemption of state consumer protection laws only in cases where the state laws prevent  significantly interfere with  or materially impair the ability of national banks to engage in the business of banking 
additionally  the wall street reform act addresses systemic risk and resolution authority in a number of ways 
first  it would create an inter agency financial services oversight council that would identify and regulate financial institutions that pose systemic risks  and these institutions would be subject to heightened oversight and regulation 
the wall street reform act also establishes a process for dismantling failing  systemically risky firms and requires assessments of financial companies with over billion in assets to pay for a systemic dissolution fund 
the wall street reform act would also make certain changes to the manner in which fees are assessed against financial institutions by the fdic 
first  the amount of the fdic s assessment would be determined based on average total assets less average tangible equity as opposed to total domestic deposits 
second  the considerations that the fdic utilizes in its risk based assessment formula would be modified to include the risks to the deposit insurance fund posed by the uninsured affiliates of the depository institution 
third  the fdic would be required to consider off balance sheet exposures when setting its rates 
the fdic s current authority to establish separate assessment systems for large and small institutions would be eliminated 
furthermore  regulatory agencies would be required to adopt joint regulations requiring creditors and securitizers to retain at least five percent of the credit risk with respect to such credit or security and prohibit the hedge or transfer of such risk 
the agencies could reduce or increase the five percent requirement depending on the circumstances 
the wall street reform act also addresses shareholder measures  including requiring public companies to provide shareholders with a non binding vote with respect to executive compensation and to have a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors 
additionally  the federal banking regulators  the securities and exchange commission sec  and the federal housing finance agency fhfa would be required to jointly issue regulations prohibiting any compensation package that encourages executives to take risks that could seriously affect the economy or threaten a financial institution s safety and soundness 
the act also includes substantial portions of hr  the mortgage reform and anti predatory lending act  which the house passed in may and discussed below in housing and mortgage lending 
no companion bill to the wall street reform act has yet been introduced in the senate

the senate sponsor  senator dick durbin  has stated he intends to continue working to enact the legislation and will use other available legislative vehicles  including reintroducing the amendment at a later date 
during the house consideration of the comprehensive regulatory reform bill in december  the bankruptcy amendment was offered  but failed
