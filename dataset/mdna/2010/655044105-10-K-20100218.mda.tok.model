item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations current conditions in ecuador 
china we have been engaged in exploration and development activities in china since  with production beginning in we have a working interest in the cheng dao xi cdx field  which is located in the shallow water of the southern bohai bay 
during fourth quarter  we drilled one horizontal well from our existing platform at the cdx field and commenced drilling a second well 
the rig will initiate a program to pre drill a number of production and injection wells designed to be connected to a second platform at the field 
this is part of the ongoing expansion project with plans to install the second platform and connect the additional wells in late china accounted for of consolidated international sales volumes and of international proved reserves at december  at december   we held approximately  net developed acres and no undeveloped acres 
additional international locations we hold approximately four million net undeveloped acres in other international locations including suriname  nicaragua  and india 
proved reserves disclosures recent sec rule making activity in december  the sec announced that it had approved revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements 
the most significant amendments to the requirements included the following commodity prices economic producibility of reserves and discounted cash flows are now based on a month average commodity price unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used 
disclosure of unproved reserves probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis 
proved undeveloped reserves guidelines reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
reserves estimation using new technologies reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in addition to flow tests and production history 
reserves personnel and estimation process additional disclosure is required regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the reserves estimation process 
we are also required to provide a general discussion of our internal controls used to assure the objectivity of the reserves estimate 
disclosure by geographic area reserves in foreign countries or continents must be presented separately if they represent more than of our total oil and gas proved reserves 
non traditional resources the definition of oil and gas producing activities has expanded and focuses on the marketable product rather than the method of extraction 
we adopted the rules effective december  effect of adoption application of the new reserve rules resulted in the use of lower prices at december  for both oil and gas than would have resulted under the previous rules 
use of new month average pricing rules at december  resulted in a decrease in proved reserves of approximately mmboe 
use of the old year end prices rules would have resulted in an increase in proved reserves of approximately mmboe at december  therefore  the total impact of the new price methodology rules resulted in negative reserves revisions of mmboe 
in addition to the new pricing methodology rules  the new proved undeveloped reserves rules  which limit puds to those scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  resulted in an additional reduction of proved reserves of approximately mmboe 

table of contents internal controls over reserves estimates our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates requires reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance and prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering principles 
responsibility for compliance in reserves bookings is delegated to our corporate reservoir engineering group and requires that reserves estimates be made by the regional reservoir engineering staff and reviewed by the regional reservoir engineering supervisor 
qualified petroleum engineers in our houston  denver and london offices prepare all reserves estimates for our different geographical regions 
these reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by regional management and senior engineering staff with final approval by the vice president strategic planning  environmental analysis reserves vice president reserves and certain members of senior management 
our vice president reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates 
our vice president reserves has a bachelor of science degree in engineering and over years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations 
the vice president reserves reports directly to our chief executive officer 
we engage a third party petroleum consulting firm to audit a significant portion of our reserves 
see third party reserves audit below 
technologies used in reserves estimation the sec s new rules expanded the technologies that a company can use to establish reserves 
the sec now allows use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty 
reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation 
we used a combination of production and pressure performance  wireline wellbore measurements  simulation studies  offset analogies  seismic data and interpretation  wireline formation tests  geophysical logs and core data to calculate our reserves estimates  including the material additions to the reserves estimates 
third party reserves audit in each of the years  and  we retained netherland  sewell associates  inc nsai  independent  third party reserves engineers  to perform reserves audits of proved reserves 
the reserves audit for included a detailed review of of our major international  deepwater gulf of mexico and us onshore fields  which covered approximately of us proved reserves and of international proved reserves of total proved reserves 
the reserves audit for included a detailed review of of our major fields and covered approximately of total proved reserves 
the reserves audit for included a detailed review of of our major fields and covered approximately of total proved reserves 
in connection with the reserves audit  nsai prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves 
in order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves  nsai examined our estimates with respect to reserves quantities  future producing rates  future net revenue  and the present value of such future net revenue 
nsai also examined our estimates with respect to reserves categorization  using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in the recently updated regulation s x rule a and subsequent sec staff interpretations and guidance 
in the conduct of the reserves audit  nsai did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests  oil and gas production  well test data  historical costs of operation and development  product prices  or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production 
however  if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of nsai which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data  nsai did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data 
nsai determined that our estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the sec  including the criteria of reasonable certainty  as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years  under existing economic and operating conditions  consistent with the definition in rule a of regulation s x 
nsai issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at december   based upon its evaluation 
the nsai opinion concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were  in the aggregate  reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 
nsai s report is attached as exhibit to this annual report on form k 
the fields audited by nsai are chosen in accordance with company guidelines and result in the audit of a minimum of of our total proved reserves 
the fields are chosen by the vice president reserves and are reviewed by senior management and the board of directors 
when compared on a field by field basis  some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of nsai 
given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves  differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected 
on a quantity basis  the nsai field estimates ranged from one mmboe above to mmboe below as compared with our estimates 
on a percentage basis  the nsai field estimates ranged from above our estimates to below our estimates 
differences between our estimates and those of nsai are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 
reserves differences at december  were  in the aggregate  approximately mmboe  or 
table of contents proved undeveloped reserves puds as of december   our puds totaled mmbbls of crude oil and bcf of natural gas  for a total of mmboe 
pud locations approximately of our puds at year end were associated with our major development areas in the wattenberg field onshore us and the alba field offshore equatorial guinea 
an additional of puds at year end were associated with major development projects at the aseng field offshore equatorial guinea and the galapagos project deepwater gulf of mexico 
all of these projects will have puds convert from undeveloped to developed as these projects begin production and or production facilities are expanded or upgraded 
changes in puds changes in puds that occurred during the year were due to conversion of approximately mmboe puds into proved developed reserves  reclassification of approximately mmboe puds that were not scheduled to be developed within five years from proved to probable reserves  and negative revisions of approximately mmboe in puds due to changes in commodity prices 
the majority of the reserves reclassified from proved reserves to probable reserves were associated with the wattenberg field  where we maintain an extensive multi year development program 
development costs costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately million in  million in and million in estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately million in  million in  and million in drilling plans all pud drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of puds associated with projects other than drilling such as compression projects are also expected to be converted to proved developed reserves prior to the end of initial production from these puds is expected to begin between to we have mmboe of puds associated with an international discovery that has been booked for longer than five years 
development planning is proceeding on this project  and drilling is expected to begin in the next two years 
the only other puds that have been booked for longer than five years are associated with compression projects 
in those cases  the reserves are expected to be recovered from existing wells
