fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change change revenue gross profit operating income percentages of revenue gross profit operating expenses operating income year ended september  compared with year ended september  operating results revenue of billion in fiscal  which included bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  increased from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue was due to the growth of abdc and the growth of absg 
during fiscal  of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was sales to retail customers  this compared to a customer mix in fiscal of institutional and retail 
sales to institutional customers increased in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased in the current fiscal year 
abdc s revenue in fiscal increased by from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market growth  revenue from our new customers  primarily the new buying group customers with which we started doing business in march and april of and a new alternate site customer which we added in august collectively representing approximately of abdc s revenue growth in fiscal  and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers 
absg s revenue in fiscal of billion increased from the prior fiscal year due to growth of its distribution businesses  primarily relating to the distribution of nephrology and blood products and its third party logistics business 
the majority of absg s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
absg s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs 
since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians  any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues 
we currently expect to grow our revenues between and in fiscal our estimated revenue growth in fiscal reflects the growth rate of the overall pharmaceutical market and the september discontinuance of our contract with an absg third party logistics customer that has transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model 
this customer loss will impact our revenue growth and absg s revenue growth in fiscal by approximately and  respectively 
our expected growth reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions  including increases in prescription drug utilization  the introduction of new products  and higher branded pharmaceutical prices  offset  in part by the increased use of lower priced generics 
our growth also may be impacted  among other things  by industry competition and changes in customer mix 
industry sales in the united states as recently estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare  inc ims  are expected to grow annually between and through our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends  including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers  general economic conditions in the united states  competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices  increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates  and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

table of contents gross profit of billion in fiscal increased by million or from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was in large part attributable to our revenue growth  the continued strong growth and profitability of our generic programs with generic revenue increasing by in comparison to the prior fiscal year and increased contributions from fee for service agreements with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in august  a generic oncology drug  oxaliplatin  was introduced launched and absg s gross profit significantly benefited from this generic launch in fiscal the gross profit benefit that we continue to receive from this generic launch significantly exceeds the typical benefit we have experienced in the past from generic launches 
approximately one third of the gross profit increase for fiscal was derived from this new generic product launch 
while we expect an increase in the number of brand to generic conversions in the future  the amount of gross profit attributable to each generic launch can vary significantly depending on the individual characteristics of each new product 
as a result  generic launches can cause significant variability in our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that future generic launches will contribute as significantly to our gross profit as they did in fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this gain was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
we are unable to estimate future gains  if any  we will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
lastly  in fiscal  we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us 
our gross profit benefited by approximately million in fiscal as a result of having completed this reconciliation 
as a percentage of revenue  our gross profit margin of in fiscal improved by basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the strong growth and profitability of our generic programs  including new and recent generic launches  and increased contributions from fee for service agreements with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers 
additionally  the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  as noted above  had the effect of increasing our gross profit margin by basis points in fiscal all of these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers  who benefit from our best pricing  and normal competitive pressures on customer margins 
our cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory  quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in our lifo charge reflects strong brand name price inflation and a year over year reduction in generic price deflation 
operating expenses of billion in fiscal increased by million or from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in bad debt expense of million primarily relating to physician customers within absg s oncology business  an increase in incentive compensation  an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  and additional expenses incurred relating to our business transformation project  which includes a new enterprise resource planning erp platform 
the above increases were offset  in part  by a million reduction in facility consolidations  employee severance and other costs and a million reduction in asset impairment charges 
asset impairment charges in the current fiscal year included a write off of capitalized software of million included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses and intangible asset impairment charges of million 
asset impairment charges in the prior fiscal year included intangible asset impairment charges of million and the write off of capitalized software of million included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were in fiscal and represented a significant basis point decline in our operating expense ratio from the prior fiscal year  reflecting our strong operating leverage particularly within abdc as its operating expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal in comparison to the prior fiscal year  despite its revenue growth 
our operating leverage has benefited from significant productivity increases achieved from our highly automated distribution facilities and our ce initiative  as described below 

table of contents in july and october  we implemented the first and second phases of our new erp platform 
as a result  we started to depreciate a significant portion of our capitalized project costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  we started to incur other significant costs to support our new erp platform as we have begun the transition from our legacy information systems to our erp platform 
this transition is expected to last through the end of the incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms  including depreciation  are expected to be approximately million per year during the transition period 
we intend to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs by reducing expenses elsewhere  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in fiscal  we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative ce designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness 
in connection with these efforts  we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions 
in fiscal  we terminated employees and incurred million of employee severance costs relating to our ce initiative 
additionally  in fiscal  we recorded million of expense to increase our liability relating to the bergen brunswig matter as described in note legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we reversed our remaining million liability relating to this matter 
operating income of billion in fiscal increased million or from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  operating income increased basis points to in fiscal due to the increase in our gross profit margin and the decrease in our operating expense ratio 
the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  the benefit from facility consolidations  employee severance and other  and the intangible asset impairments increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal the costs of facility consolidations  employee severance and other  and the intangible asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal interest expense  interest income  and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal and were as follows in thousands weighted average weighted average amount interest rate amount interest rate interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of million in average borrowings  offset in part  by an increase in interest costs capitalized relating to our business transformation project and a decrease in the weighted average variable interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to from in the prior fiscal year 
interest costs capitalized in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
we expect to capitalize significantly less interest costs related to our business transformation project in fiscal  since we began to implement our new erp platform in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate  offset in part  by an increase in average invested cash of million 
average borrowings increased in fiscal resulting from the november issuance of million of new year senior notes  offset in part  by the repayment of substantially all amounts then outstanding under out multi currency revolving credit facility both described in liquidity and capital resources 
our net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings  interest rates  amendments and or renewals to our current borrowing facilities  and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 
income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective income tax rate of  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
due to the impact of discrete tax events  we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal and  thereby reducing our effective tax rate from a normalized 
income from continuing operations of million in fiscal increased from million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in fiscal increased from per share in the prior fiscal year 
the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding  primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 

table of contents year ended september  compared with year ended september  operating results revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to the growth of absg and the growth of abdc  which was impacted by the july  loss of certain business approximately billion on an annualized basis with a national retail drug chain customer 
excluding the loss of the above mentioned business  revenue in fiscal would have increased by from the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal and  of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers 
sales to institutional customers increased primarily due to the growth of absg and the addition of a new large hospital buying group customer 
sales to retail customers decreased slightly in the current fiscal year as the loss of the above mentioned national chain business was offset  in part  by market growth and the addition of a new large independent retail buying group customer 
abdc s revenue in fiscal increased by from the prior fiscal year  primarily due to revenue from two new large customers  and was partially offset by the loss of certain business with a large retail drug chain customer  as mentioned above 
absg s revenue in fiscal of billion increased from the prior fiscal year due to good growth broadly across its distribution and service businesses offset  in part  by declining anemia drug sales see paragraph below 
the majority of absg s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
revenue related to the distribution of anemia related products  which represented of revenue in fiscal  decreased approximately from the prior fiscal year 
the decline in sales of anemia related products has been most pronounced in the use of these products for cancer treatment 
sales of oncology anemia related products represented approximately of total revenue in fiscal and decreased approximately from the prior fiscal year 
several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs  including expanded warning and other product safety labeling requirements  more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with undergoing dialysis or experiencing kidney failure  and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use 
as a result  oncology related anemia drug sales declined further in fiscal from our fiscal total 
gross profit of billion in fiscal increased by million or from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to the strong growth and increased profitability of our generic programs  including specialty generics with generic revenue increasing by in comparison to the prior fiscal year  increased contributions from our fee for service agreements including million of fees relating to prior period sales resulting from the execution of new agreements in the quarter ended december   and good growth from absg s businesses  all of which was offset  in part  by absg s million write down of influenza vaccine inventory in the december quarter  and normal competitive pressures on customer margins in the current fiscal year 
gross profit in fiscal benefited from a settlement of million with a former customer 
gross profit in the prior fiscal year benefited from a gain of million relating to favorable litigation settlements with a former customer and a major competitor  and an million settlement of disputed fees with a supplier  and was partially offset by an million inventory write down of certain pharmacy equipment 
additionally  in the prior fiscal year  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit in fiscal was  an increase of basis point from the prior fiscal year 
we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal and lifo charges reflect brand name supplier price inflation  which more than offset price deflation of generic drugs 
operating expenses of billion in fiscal declined by nearly million when compared to the prior fiscal year as a decrease in facility consolidations  employee severance and other charges of million  a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of million  and a decrease in asset impairment charges of million were offset  in part  by an increase in bad debt expense of million 
asset impairment charges in fiscal included intangible asset impairment charges of million and the write off of certain capitalized software totaling million included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses 
asset impairment charges in fiscal included intangible asset impairment charges of million related to certain of our smaller business units and impairment charges related to capitalized equipment and software development costs totaling million included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses  primarily due to abdc s decision to abandon the use of certain software  which will be replaced in connection with our business transformation project 
additionally  expenses incurred in fiscal in connection with our business transformation project increased by million from the prior fiscal year 
as a result of our ce initiative described below  we were able to substantially offset these incremental costs by reducing our warehouse operating costs through continuing productivity improvements and by streamlining our organizational structures within abdc and absg 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were and in fiscal and respectively 

table of contents the following table illustrates the charges incurred relating to facility consolidations  employee severance and other for the fiscal years ended september  and in thousands facility consolidations and employee severance costs relating to business divestitures total facility consolidations  employee severance and other in fiscal  we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative ce designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness 
in connection with these efforts  we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions 
during fiscal and  we terminated and employees and incurred million and million of employee severance costs  respectively  relating to our ce initiative 
additionally  in fiscal  we recorded million of additional expense relating to the bergen brunswig matter as described in note legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we reversed million of employee severance charges previously estimated and recorded relating to a prior integration plan 
costs related to business divestitures in fiscal related to the sale of our former workers compensation business  pmsi 
operating income of million in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  operating income of in fiscal increased basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in revenue while operating expense dollars remained relatively flat 
the costs of facility consolidations  employee severance and other  and the charges relating to intangible asset impairments  less the gain on antitrust litigation settlements had the effect of decreasing operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in each of fiscal and interest expense  interest income  and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal and were as follows in thousands weighted average weighted average amount interest rate amount interest rate interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense decreased from the prior fiscal year due to a decrease of million in average borrowings and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to from in the prior fiscal year

income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective income tax rate of  versus in the prior fiscal year 
due to the impact of discrete tax events  we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal  thereby reducing our effective tax rate from the prior fiscal year 
income from continuing operations of million in fiscal increased from million in the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income  the decrease in interest expense and the reduction in the effective income tax rate 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in fiscal increased from per share in the prior fiscal year 
the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 

table of contents loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  in fiscal included a final pmsi working capital adjustment of million and costs in connection with a prior period business disposition 
loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  in fiscal primarily related to the pmsi business  and included a million charge  net of income taxes  to reduce its carrying value 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for a complete list of significant accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise 
we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote 
each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly 
there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september   and and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods 
the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts  net of write offs  recoveries and other adjustments 
schedule ii of this form k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september    and was million  million  and million respectively 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately million 
supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives  including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them 
these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims  historical experience with the suppliers  the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us 
we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances 
an increase or decrease of in the supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately million 
the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 
loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
we regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 
merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost for approximately and of our inventories at september  and  respectively  has been determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
if we had used the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been approximately million and higher than the amounts reported at september  and  respectively 
we recorded a lifo charge of million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 

table of contents business combinations the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values  with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships  trade names  existing technology  and other intangible assets  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual events 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships  non compete agreements  patents and software technology  are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value impairment indicators 
this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows  analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management 
in fiscal  due to the existence of impairment indicators at us bioservices  a specialty pharmacy company within the company s specialty group  we performed an impairment test on the pharmacy s trade name as of june   which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
in fiscal  our pmsi business unit which we sold in fiscal experienced certain customer losses and learned that it would lose its largest customer at the end of calendar as a result  and after considering other factors  we committed to a plan to divest pmsi 
we performed an interim impairment test of our pmsi reporting unit and determined that its goodwill was impaired 
therefore  pmsi wrote off the carrying value of its goodwill of million 
in addition  we also recognized charges of million to record the estimated loss on the sale of pmsi see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal and and  as a result  recorded million and million of impairment charges  respectively 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
share based compensation we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense  which involves the use of several assumptions  including expected term of the option  future volatility  dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors  such as implied volatility 

table of contents income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
we have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by million in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table illustrates our debt structure at september   including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility in thousands outstanding additional balance availability fixed rate debt  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due other total fixed rate debt variable rate debt blanco revolving credit facility due multi currency revolving credit facility due receivables securitization facility due other total variable rate debt total debt  including current portion along with our cash balances  our aggregate availability under our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements 
we have a million multi currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility  which expires in november  the multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
interest on borrowings under the multi currency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from basis points to basis points over libor euribor bankers acceptance stamping fee  as applicable basis points over libor euribor bankers acceptance stamping fee at september  
additionally  interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate 
we pay quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the multi currency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating  ranging from basis points to basis points of the total commitment basis points at september  
we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multi currency revolving credit facility at any time 
the multi currency revolving credit facility contains covenants  including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test  as well as others that impose limitations on  among other things  indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales 
we have a million receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility 
in april  we amended this facility  which now expires in april we continue to have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to million  subject to lender approval  for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters 
interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper or libor plus a program fee 
we pay a commitment fee to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility 
in connection with the april commitment  the program fee and commitment fee were reduced to basis points and basis points  respectively 
at september   there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility 
the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multi currency revolving credit facility 
in connection with the receivables securitization facility  abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation  a wholly owned special purpose entity  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions 
abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility 
after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected  additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility 
we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 
in fiscal  we will seek to renew the multi currency revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility at available market rates  which may be higher than the rates currently available to us 

table of contents in april  we amended the million blanco revolving credit facility  the blanco credit facility to  among other things  extend the maturity date of the blanco credit facility to april borrowings under the blanco credit facility are guaranteed by us 
interest on borrowings under this facility continues to be basis points over libor 
the blanco credit facility is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september  because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis 
we have million of senior notes due september  the notes  million of senior notes due september  the notes  and million of senior notes due november  the notes 
the notes and notes each were sold at of the principal amount and have an effective yield of and  respectively 
the notes were sold in november at of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 
interest on the notes  the notes  and the notes is payable semiannually in arrears 
all of the senior notes rank pari passu to the multi currency revolving credit facility 
our operating results have generated cash flow  which  together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers  has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements  and to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  repayment of debt  the payment of interest on outstanding debt  dividends  and repurchases of shares of our common stock 
deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and  therefore  reduce purchases by our customers

table of contents market risk our most significant market risk is the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt

for every million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by million 
we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non us operations 
our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar 
we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates 
such contracts generally have durations of less than one year 
we had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september  we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes
