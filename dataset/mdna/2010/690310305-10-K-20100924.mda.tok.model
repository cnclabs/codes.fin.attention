overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial position and operating performance 
generation of revenue 
we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our data protection products 
the balance of our revenue is provided by selling maintenance contracts and rendering related services  selling spare parts  and earning royalties on our licensed technology 
the majority of our sales are generated through our branded channel which includes systems integrators and vars  with the remainder from our private label arrangements with oems 
business transition 
in august  we announced that our largest oem customer  hp  had selected an alternate supplier for its next generation mid range tape automation products 
hp began purchasing the alternate supplier s new product line during the first quarter of calendar year  which decreased our sales to hp 
however  in mid hp re launched its tape automation products containing our product with support for hp s new lto tape drives  causing a slowdown in the rate of replacement of our products by the alternate supplier s product 
although we believe that our sales to hp will continue to decline  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we extended our supply agreement with hp until july with automatic renewals for three successive one year periods unless earlier terminated by either party 
revenue from hp in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal  and decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal during fiscal  we continued to experience decreased revenues 
we believe customers have delayed purchases or chose not to purchase for a number of reasons  including  among others  i the uncertainty of the world economy and a general decrease in it spending and ii a reluctance by some customers to purchase our products due to weakness in our financial condition 
due in large part to the overall decline in hp revenue  we reported net revenue of million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decline in net revenue resulted in a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal positive trends 
during fiscal  we have achieved a number of financial and operational objectives designed to further our efforts to regain profitability operating expenses for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal research and development expense decreased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily associated with the streamlining of our product roadmap to focus on new products in tape  storage area network  and network attached storage disk based solutions that better suit our product portfolio 
sales and marketing expense decreased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to changes in our marketing programs and realignment of our sales force 
liquidity and capital resources 
at june   we had a cash balance of million  compared to million at june  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock in a private placement for a total issuance price of million net proceeds of approximately million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at per share for gross proceeds of million net proceeds of approximately million and we received million from the liquidation of our auction rate securities ars 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
we currently have financing agreements in place with a borrowing base that is determined by the amount of qualifying non oem accounts receivable sales during a period 
our practice has been to borrow the full amount of non oem accounts receivable sales we transact 
we have no unused source of liquidity at this time and cash management and preservation continues to be a top priority 
we expect to incur negative operating cash flows during the remainder of calendar as we continue to reshape our business model and further improve operational efficiencies 
management has projected that cash on hand  including cash received from our private placement of shares of series a convertible preferred stock in february  and funding available under the our non oem accounts receivable financing agreements will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations at current levels through the end of calendar significant changes from our current forecast  including  but not limited to i shortfalls from projected sales levels  ii unexpected increases in product costs  iii increases in operating costs and or iv changes to the historical timing of collecting accounts receivable or to the borrowing terms on our non oem account receivable financing arrangements  could have a material adverse affect on our ability to access the level of funding necessary to continue operations at current levels 
if any of these events occur  management may be forced to make further reductions in spending  further extend payment terms with suppliers  liquidate assets where possible  and or suspend or curtail planned programs 
any of these actions could materially harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
as of june   we had working capital of million  reflecting a million increase in current assets compared to june   and a million decrease in current liabilities during fiscal the increase in current assets is primarily attributable our private placement of shares of series a convertible preferred stock in february  offset by cash used in operating activities and reduced sales  resulting in lower inventory balances 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to a million reduction in debt primarily related to payments made on outstanding notes payable to anacomp  inc anacomp and adaptec  inc 
adaptec  a million reduction in the product warranty liability and a million reduction in accrued liabilities 
current liabilities associated with our non oem accounts receivable financing arrangements  including accrued interest  were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of these arrangements 
industry trends 
we estimate that the cost of data management is four times the cost of storage devices 
furthermore  many smes and smbs are seeking to implement tiered storage for primary and secondary data utilizing a combination of low cost sata serial ata drives and high performance sas serial attached scsi drives 
idc estimates that the total networked attached storage nas market will grow at approximately through  and the growth rate for nas storage systems in price bands up to  where most of our snap server solutions lie  is estimated at 
according to idc  tape storage still constitutes approximately of the total storage revenue in the global storage market 
sales of tape automation appliances represented and of our revenue during fiscal and  respectively 
recent developments in july  we launched two new products  the snap sever n  our first u rack mountable nas product and the neo e  which provides new functionality and increased performance to the neo on july   we modified our san diego headquarters lease and reduced the facility by one building  or  square feet  which proportionally reduced our monthly base rent and share of facility expenses 
on september   the committee approved the bonus plan 
for more information regarding the bonus plan  see business recent developments in part i  item of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  available for sale securities  share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes and restructuring charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management s view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
under this policy  revenue on direct product sales excluding sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
these customers are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection  except for any defective product that may be returned under our warranty policy 
generally  title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock 
product sales to distribution customers are subject to certain rights of return  stock rotation privileges and price protection 
because we are unable to estimate our exposure for returned product or price adjustments  revenue from shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related products are in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the distributor 
for products in which software is more than an incidental component  we recognize revenue in accordance with current authoritative guidance for software revenue recognition 
when there are multiple elements in an arrangement  we allocate revenue to the separate elements based on relative fair value  provided we have fair value for all elements of the arrangement 
if in an arrangement we have fair value for undelivered elements but not the delivered element  we defer the fair value of the undelivered element s and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered element s 
undelivered elements typically include services 
revenue from extended warranty and product service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
we have various royalty arrangements with independent service providers that sell our product and also sell and provide service on our product 
these independent service providers pay a royalty fee for service contracts in place on our product 
the royalty fee is calculated by us for the units covered in the quarter  and agreed to by the service provider  based upon the monthly fee for each unit covered by the independent service provider 
we have various licensing agreements relating to our variable rate randomizer vr technology with third parties 
the licensees pay us a royalty fee for sales of their products that incorporate our vr technology 
the licensees provide us with periodic reports that include the quantity of units  subject to royalty  sold to their end users 
we record the royalty when reported to us by the licensee  generally in the period during which the licensee ships the products containing vr technology 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accounts receivable portfolio 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade and other receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customers payment terms and or patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  impairing their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made the determination 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as considered necessary 
generally  our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification 
if we fail to identify an account as doubtful  or if we identify an account as uncollectible that is later collected  our results could vary 
share based compensation share based compensation expense can be significant to our results of operations  even though no cash is used for such expense 
in determining period expense associated with unvested options  we estimate the fair value of each option at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the award 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise 
in addition  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we primarily use historical data to determine the inputs and assumptions to be used in the black scholes pricing model 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and could materially affect the measure of estimated fair value and make it difficult to compare the results in future periods to our current results 
a change in our share based compensation for the year ended june  would have affected our net loss by  inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including  among others  expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we adjust our inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  we may need to record additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitments 
impairment of long lived assets we test for recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when the carrying value is not considered recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the related assets 
such impairment charges may be material 
fair value is generally determined based on the estimated future discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or asset group using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the assumptions supporting the cash flow analysis  including the discount rates  are determined using management s best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if our future results are significantly different than forecasted  we may be required to further evaluate our long lived assets for recoverability and record impairment charges for these assets that could adversely affect our results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million impairment related to our property and equipment 
see fiscal compared with fiscal impairment of long lived assets under the heading results of operations below 
the estimated fair value of these assets was determined using the income approach  which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  as well as consideration of the estimated value that could be realized upon sale 
the assumptions used by us included estimates of i projected cash flows for a period approximating the remaining estimated useful life of the asset group  ii a discount rate commensurate with the implied risk in an investment in us and the risk of the underlying cash flows  and iii enterprise value 
warranty obligations we provide for estimated future costs of warranty obligations in accordance with current accounting rules 
for return to factory and on site warranties  we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we may be required to increase our warranty accrual 
any such unforeseen increases may have an adverse impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur 
similarly  if we experience a decrease in warranty claims or our costs to provide services decline  we may be required to decrease our warranty accrual  which may have a favorable impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur

service revenue gross profit on service revenue during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal the increase of million  or  was primarily associated with an increase in warranty contracts recognized in fiscal compared with fiscal gross margin on service revenue at for fiscal increased from for fiscal primarily due to new service offerings and the addition of the snap server product line  which have more favorable margins 
share based compensation 
during fiscal  we had share based compensation expense of million compared with million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million is primarily due to a one time grant of stock options to acquire  in the aggregate  million shares of our common stock in august to executive officers and key employees as a retention tool 
the share based compensation expense associated with the august option grants was recognized primarily in fiscal these options vested monthly for one year and resulted in increased share based compensation expense through the first quarter of fiscal compensation expense associated with option and restricted stock awards with graded vesting is recognized on an accelerated basis

research and development expense 
research and development expense in fiscal remained flat at million compared to fiscal during fiscal there was a decrease of million in material intensive product development expenses due to the completion of scheduled research and development projects 
this decrease was offset by i a million increase in employee and related expenses related to our acquisition of the snap server product line in june  which increased average headcount by eight employees  and ii an increase of million in outside contractor expenses for tape library development 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense in fiscal increased to million from million during fiscal the increase of million  or  is primarily due to i an increase of million in legal fees  for financing and strategic alternatives  ii an increase of million in amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of the snap server product line in june  and iii an increase of million in outside contractor expenses  principally for financial and accounting services

impairment of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to property and equipment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management performed impairment analyses of its long lived assets as of june  and due to our continued operating and cash flow losses and our forecasts 
the impairment analysis as of june   excluded the long lived assets from the recently completed snap server acquisition note to the consolidated financial statements 
we concluded that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable as of june   and consequently we recognized an impairment loss of million 
management concluded that the carrying amount of the asset group including the long lived assets from the snap server acquisition which has been fully integrated into our operations was recoverable as of june   and therefore did not record an impairment loss on our long lived assets in fiscal interest income 
during fiscal  we generated interest income of million  compared with million during the prior fiscal year 
the decrease of million  or  is due to the decrease in cash and investment balances in fiscal compared with fiscal we liquidated our short term investments in the first quarter of fiscal interest expense

we recorded nominal income tax expense during fiscal compared with million during fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain tax positions and the favorable settlement of tax issues with the tax authorities 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had a cash balance of million  compared to million at june  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock in a private placement for a total issuance price of million net proceeds of approximately million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at per share for gross proceeds of million net proceeds of approximately million and we received million from the liquidation of our ars 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
we currently have financing agreements in place with a borrowing base that is determined by the amount of qualifying non oem accounts receivables sales during a period 
our practice has been to borrow the full amount of non oem accounts receivable sales we transact 
we have no unused source of liquidity at this time and cash management and preservation continues to be a top priority 
we expect to incur negative cash flows during the remainder of calendar as we continue to reshape our business model and further improve operational efficiencies 
as of june   we had working capital of million  reflecting a million increase in current assets compared to june   and a million decrease in current liabilities during fiscal the increase in current assets is primarily attributable our private placement of shares of series a convertible preferred stock in february  offset by cash used in operating activities and reduced sales  resulting in lower inventory balances 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to a million reduction in debt related to payments made on our outstanding notes payable to anacomp and adaptec  a million reduction in the product warranty liability and million reduction in accrued liabilities 
current liabilities associated with our non oem accounts receivable financing arrangements  including accrued interest  were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
we rely on our two financing arrangements to support our working capital needs 
in november  we entered into the marquette commercial finance mcf financing agreement which provides up to million gross of financing against domestic non oem accounts receivable 
in march  we entered into the faunus group international fgi financing agreement which provides up to million gross of financing against foreign non oem accounts receivable 
under the mcf financing agreement  we are not obligated to offer any accounts invoices in any month  and mcf has the right to decline to purchase any offered accounts invoices 
to date  individual invoices declined by mcf were considered immaterial to our accounts receivable balance  financial position and cash flows 
a significant increase in rebates claimed as a percentage of our gross collections could lead to our failure to satisfy the dilution covenant 
in august and october  due to rebates claimed  the permissible dilution covenant was exceeded 
mcf waived this deviation from the covenant 
in january  mcf revised the dilution covenant to be based on a rolling day calculation  excluding one time charges 
as of june   we were in compliance with the dilution covenant in the mcf financing agreement as revised 
management continues to monitor our compliance with the dilution covenant  which is based on the aggregate amount of credit memoranda  discounts and other downward adjustments to the original invoiced price divided by gross collections 
based upon our current operating assumptions  we expect to remain in compliance with the permissible dilution covenant throughout fiscal fgi may terminate the fgi financing agreement upon default by us  and may also terminate the agreement for convenience upon days advance notice 
we may terminate the agreement at any time by paying a  termination fee 
the termination fee is not payable upon a termination by fgi or upon non renewal 
we were in compliance with the terms of the fgi financing agreement at june  based upon our current operating assumptions  we expect to remain in compliance with the terms of the fgi financing agreement throughout fiscal management has projected that cash on hand  including cash received from our private placement of shares of series a convertible preferred stock in february  and funding available under our non oem accounts receivable financing agreements will be sufficient to allow it to continue operations at current levels through the end of calendar significant changes from our current forecast  including but not limited to i shortfalls from projected sales levels  ii unexpected increases in product costs  iii increases in operating costs and or iv changes to the historical timing of collecting accounts receivable or to the borrowing terms on our non oem account receivable financing arrangements  could have a material adverse affect on our ability to access the level of funding necessary to continue operations at current levels 
if any of these events occur management may be forced to make further reductions in spending  may be forced to further extend payment terms with suppliers  liquidate assets where possible  and or to suspend or curtail planned programs 
any of these actions could materially harm our business  results of operations and future prospects
