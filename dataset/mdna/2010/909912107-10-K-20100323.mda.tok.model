item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  which is incorporated by reference herein 
employees at march   the company employed approximately persons  approximately of which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in february the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good 
competition the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional real estate brokers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts 
there are numerous regional and local commercial developers  real estate companies  financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and tenants 
the company s hotels compete with national  regional  and local hotels in each of their geographic markets 
competition is based on a number of factors  most notably convenience of location  brand affiliation  price  range of services and guest amenities offered  quality of customer service  and the overall condition of the property 
the company competes with at least other companies in the sale of engineered products 
the company emphasizes product performance and service in connection with the sale of these products 
the principal competition faced by the company results from the sales price of the products sold by its competitors 
backlog the dollar value of unfilled orders of the company s engineered products segment was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in backlog is principally due to slowdown in demand for the company s engineered product lines which is related to the current economic conditions 
it is anticipated that substantially all of the backlog will be filled in substantially all of the backlog was filled in the order backlog referred to above does not include any order backlog with respect to sales of knitted wire mesh components for exhaust emission control devices  exhaust seals or airbag components because of the manner in which customer orders are received 
environmental regulations federal  state  and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have had and will continue to have a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
it is the policy of the company to manage  operate  and maintain its facilities in compliance  in all material respects  with applicable standards for the prevention  control  and abatement of environmental pollution to prevent damage to the quality of air  land  and resources 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at the company s two new jersey facilities and has recorded a liability for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associated therewith 
the process of remediation has begun at one facility pursuant to a plan filed with the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep 
management s assessment  based on estimates from environmental contractors  is that under the most probable scenario  the remediation of this site is anticipated to require initial expenditures of  including the cost of capital equipment  and  in annual operating and maintenance costs over a year period 
environmental studies at the second facility indicate that remediation may be necessary 
based upon the facts presently available  management s assessment  based on estimates from environmental contractors  is that  under the most probable remediation scenario  the estimated cost to remediate this site is anticipated to require million in initial costs  including capital equipment expenditures  and  in annual operating and maintenance costs over a year period 
these estimated costs of future expenses for remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
the company may revise such estimates in the future due to the uncertainty regarding the nature  timing  and extent of any remediation efforts that may be required at this site  should an appropriate regulatory agency deem such efforts to be necessary 
the foregoing estimates may also be revised by the company as new or additional information in these matters becomes available or should the njdep or other regulatory agencies require additional or alternative remediation efforts in the future 
although such events are not expected to change these estimates  adverse decisions or events  particularly as to the merits of the company s factual and legal basis  could cause the company to change its estimate of liability with respect to such matters in the future 
the company had approximately million and million recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities as of december  and  respectively  to cover such matters

risk factors the following are some of the risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such statements the recent economic downturn and financial crisis could negatively affect our businesses  results of operations and financial condition 
although recent economic trends appear to have stabilized  current us and global economic conditions have affected and  most likely  will continue to affect our results of operations and financial position 
slower economic activity  increased unemployment  the continued crisis in the financial and credit markets  concerns about inflation and energy costs  decreased business and consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns have and will continue to have a negative affect on the company s business segments 
if the economic and market conditions remain uncertain or weaken further  the company may experience material adverse impacts on its businesses  financial condition and results of operations 
our performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 
although the company s leases are generally long term and may be below market  real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid 
among the factors that may impact our real estate property values or the revenues derived from our portfolio are changes in the national  regional  and local economic climate  the attractiveness of our properties to tenants  competition from other available property owners and changes in market rental rates 
our performance also depends on the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rent from tenants and to pay for adequate maintenance  insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes  which could increase over time 
also  the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 
the company reviews the carrying value of its properties when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate potential impairment may exist 
if the evaluation indicates an inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded 
impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our results could be negatively affected by delinquencies in our mortgage or high yield loan receivables 
on a limited basis we provide high yield  short term mortgage loans that we believe are collateralized by desirable properties at substantial value to loan ratios 
although we believe that the collateral for these loans is sufficient to recover its carrying value  changes in the real estate market in the locale in which the property is located or delinquencies by the borrower could negatively affect our carrying value for these loans and  ultimately  our results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet obligations could deplete our liquidity and capital resources 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
the debt of the joint venture in which we currently have an ownership interest is a non recourse obligation and is collateralized by the entity s real property 
we believe that with each arrangement the value of the underlying property and its operating cash flows are sufficient to satisfy its obligations 
in addition  we are not obligated for the debts of the joint venture 
however  we could decide to satisfy the debts of the joint venture to protect our investment 
in such event  our capital resources and financial condition would be reduced and  in certain instances  the carrying value of our investment and our results of operations would be negatively impacted 
our cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail 
our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
we maintain the cash and cash equivalents with reputable major financial institutions 
deposits with these banks exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets 
our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 
we invest funds in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates of deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
significant declines in the value of these investments due to operating performance of the companies we invest in or general economic or market conditions may result in the recognition of realized or impairment losses which could be material 
operating results of our hotel operations are subject to conditions common in the lodging industry 
the performance of the lodging industry has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy 
as the global financial crisis continues  other sectors of the global economy have been adversely impacted and has prolonged the global recession 
as the hotel business is dependent upon consumer and business spending  significant reduction in lodging demand  as has been experienced in and likely to continue throughout  could have a material adverse impact on the operating results of our hotels 
in addition  changes in certain factors could adversely impact hotel room demand and pricing and result in reduced occupancy or could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
these factors include local conditions such as an oversupply of  or a reduction in demand for  hotel rooms  the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers and competition from other hotels  the quality  philosophy and performance of the managers of our hotels  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors such as increases in the price of energy  healthcare or insurance  changes in travel patterns  extreme weather conditions and cancellation of or changes in events scheduled to occur in our markets  seasonality  inherent in the hotel industry  may cause our results to fluctuate significantly between quarters  and other unpredictable external factors  such as acts of god  war  terrorist attacks  epidemics  airline strikes  transportation and fuel price increases and severe weather  may reduce business and leisure travel 
our engineered products segment relies on significant customers and has a concentration of customers in the automotive industry 
the company sells its engineered products to many customers throughout the world 
historically  a small number of customers have accounted for significant portions of these sales 
for the year ended december   sales by the engineered products segment to general motors  its largest customer  accounted for of the segment s sales 
since our engineered products segment accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  the loss of general motors as a customer  or a significant decline in sales to them  would adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  the deterioration in the global economy has negatively impacted business activity in general  and specifically the engineered product markets in which the company operates 
these conditions had a dramatic impact on global automotive production and  in turn  negatively impacted sales of our automotive product line 
modest signs of recovery were evident by late and are continuing into  but at levels far below those of and prior 
continued adverse developments in the automotive industry  including but not limited to continued share declines in demand  customer bankruptcies and increased demands on the company for pricing decreases  have had  and will continue to have  a significant adverse affect on the company s financial results and cash flows 
our engineered products segment could be adversely affected by technological and regulatory changes 
changes in legislative  regulatory or industry requirements or competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete 
our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products successfully on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for the company to remain competitive or that certain of our products will not become obsolete 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications  including lack of market acceptance  delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our engineered products are highly competitive 
we compete with a number of other manufacturers that produce and sell similar products 
we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more commercially effective than our own 
some of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales and distribution resources greater than ours 
in addition  the global economy continues to be in a period of weak economic growth 
while recent increases in demand for our engineered products towards the end of and into the beginning of are encouraging  it is uncertain if such recoveries are sustainable or to what extent the company will benefit from increased demand 
continued declines in sales of our engineered products segment could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 
an interruption in the supply  or a significant increase in the cost  of our raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
the principal raw materials used in the company s engineered products business are stainless steel wire  steel related products and copper  which are typically purchased from multiple suppliers throughout the world 
the price and availability of raw materials can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control  including general domestic and international economic conditions  labor costs  supply and demand  competition  import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates 
these factors could significantly affect the availability and cost of our raw materials which are generally purchased at levels that we believe will satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon contractual commitments  historical buying practices and market conditions 
we may be unable to recover raw material cost increases due to contractual or competitive conditions 
conversely  reductions in raw material prices could result in lower sales prices for our products and lower margins as we utilize existing inventories 
therefore  changing raw material costs could significantly impact our revenues  gross margins  operating and net income 
if  in the future  we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of stainless steel wire or other critical raw materials on a timely basis and at competitive prices  we may be unable to fulfill our customers requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  we are subject to the risk of third party claims of infringement 
our engineered products business relies in large part upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know how and production techniques 
historically  patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon the laws regarding unfair competition  restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
we limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we are not currently involved in any litigation regarding the infringement upon our intellectual property or regarding our infringement upon the intellectual property of others 
our operations are subject to environmental regulation and environmental problems which are possible and can be costly 
our engineered products segment is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products 
we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such property 
we have undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at our two new jersey facilities and have recorded a liability for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associated therewith see environmental regulations in item of part i and note  commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company may revise such estimates in the future due to the uncertainty regarding the nature  timing and extent of any remediation efforts that may be required at these sites  should an appropriate regulatory agency deem such efforts to be necessary 
the estimates may also be revised as new or additional information in these matters becomes available or should the njdep or other regulatory agencies require additional or alternative remediation efforts in the future 
although we do not expect such events to significantly change our estimates  adverse decisions or events  particularly as to the merits of our factual and legal basis  could cause us to change our estimate of liability with respect to such matters in the future 
accordingly  we are unable to predict whether our estimate of future remediation costs will materially increase in the future 
current and future litigation could have an adverse effect on the company 
the company is subject to various litigation  legal  regulatory and tax matters  some of which could be considered frivolous  that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
these lawsuits and other legal proceedings can involve substantial costs  including the costs associated with investigation  litigation and possible settlement  judgment  penalty or fine 
although insurance is maintained to mitigate these costs  there can be no assurance that costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings will be covered by insurance or will not exceed the limits of insurance policies 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if a judgment  penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
for example  during the twelve months ended december   the sales price of our common stock fluctuated between and per share 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance 
mr 
af petrocelli can control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  mr 
af petrocelli  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer  beneficially owns  in the aggregate  approximately of the company s outstanding common stock exclusive of options 
such amount includes shares held by his wife but does not include shares held by the adult children or grandchildren of mr 
petrocelli 
accordingly  mr 
petrocelli is able to exercise considerable influence over the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as mergers or other business combinations 
our company is a controlled company pursuant to nyse amex rules and  therefore  is not required to comply with certain governance requirements 
the company has elected to be a controlled company pursuant to nyse amex rules 
the company is eligible to make this election because af petrocelli  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer beneficially owns more than of the company s outstanding stock 
as a result of being a controlled company  the company is not required to comply with the following corporate governance requirements of the nyse amex i majority of independent directors  ii fully independent nominating committee and iii fully independent compensation committee 
while the company currently has a fully independent compensation committee  it does not have a majority of independent directors or a fully independent nominating committee 
as a result  the quality of board oversight may be reduced as compared with companies which have a fully independent nominating committee and a majority of independent directors and the company has a greater risk of conflicts of interest without these safeguards 
in addition  the lack of an independent nominating committee increases the possibility that the company will not have independent directors serving on the board of directors

these facilities are owned by a subsidiary of the company 
the engineered products segment also leases a manufacturing facility in tijuana  mexico  with approximately  square feet of floor space 
item legal proceedings in may  an insurance company for one of the company s subsidiaries  purchased as part of a bankruptcy reorganization  filed suit in supreme court of the state of new york against such entity s other insurance companies seeking  among other things  contribution for insurance settlements from carriers  some of which now claim to be exhausted 
the complaint also names the company s subsidiary and several underlying claimants with whom such settlements were reached 
the action challenges the exhaustion of the underlying policies and seeks contribution as well as a declaration of the rights  duties and liabilities of the parties under the insurance policies 
in june  the company removed the action to the us court for the southern district of new york

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the description of the company s business and properties contained in items and of part i and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations and total revenues for the year ended december  were million  generating operating income of million 
this compares to total revenues and operating income for the year ended december  of million and million  respectively 
the results reflect the impact that the economic conditions have had on the company s engineered products and hotel segments 
net income for was million or 
per basic share  compared to million or 
per basic share for the results includes million in realized losses on the company s marketable securities portfolio and a million gain from the sale of a property  reflected as income from discontinued operations  on a net of tax basis 
although business trends improved near the end of and early  the company will continue to conservatively manage its resources given the difficulty in predicting whether such trends will continue 
real estate operations the company s real estate operations consist of the real estate investment and management and hotel operations segments 
the operating results for these segments are as follows year ended december  year ended december  in thousands real estate hotel operations total real estate hotel operations total revenues mortgage interest expense depreciation expense other operating expenses operating income loss real estate investment and management revenues from the real estate investment and management segment for the year ended december  were million  a fluctuation of less than from that reported for the year ended december  revenues from the company s real estate portfolio are generally derived from properties with single tenant  long term leases 
therefore  rental revenues recognized under generally accepted accounting principles do not fluctuate significantly  but are affected by lease renewals  terminations and the purchase or sale of additional properties 
mortgage interest expense on real property held for rental decreased  or for the year ended december   compared to  primarily as a result of continuing mortgage amortization 
this was offset by additional interest from mortgages associated with property acquisitions in the current and prior year 
the mortgage assumed  bears interest at per annum  is payable monthly and matures in november as a result of this additional obligation  mortgage interest expense from the company s real estate investment and management segment will increase in at december   the outstanding mortgage balance on the company s real estate investment and management portfolio was less than million 
depreciation expense associated with real properties held for rental increased  for the year ended december   compared to  as the result of building improvements made to real estate assets during the current and prior years 
due to the purchase of a commercial property in november  depreciation expense on the company s properties should be slightly higher in than in other operating expenses associated with the management of real properties decreased  or for the year ended december   compared to such expenses incurred in this decline is primarily the result of decreases in personnel costs  the cost of utilities  and lower professional fees  associated with lease renewals and other property related transactions 
these decreases are partially offset by increases in license fees  and property maintenance costs  which are the result of the timing of certain repairs and renovations 
operating expenses could fluctuate in the future from those previously incurred due to the extent of property age  location and vacancies 
hotel operations hotel revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of  or from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of additional revenues million resulting from the august acquisition of a hotel located in miami  florida the miami hotel 
the remaining three properties in the company s hotel operating segment experienced revenue declines as a result of the overall weakness in the us economy which caused a reduction in both consumer and business travel 
due to the acquisition of the miami hotel  hotel revenues are expected to increase during mortgage interest expense related to the company s hotel properties increased  for the year ended december   compared with that reported in the additional cost is primarily the result of a mortgage obtained on one of the company s hotels in the prior year 
without refinancing or additional borrowings  mortgage interest expense from the company s hotel operations will decline with scheduled principal reductions 
depreciation expense associated with the company s hotel operations increased  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to additional depreciation expense  related to the miami hotel acquired in august and from additional depreciation expense  related to renovations and improvements added during the year at two of the company s hotels 
as a result of the miami hotel acquisition and these renovations and improvements  depreciation expense for should be higher than that reported in other operating expenses related to the management of the company s hotels increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in this increase is primarily related to additional operating expenses million from the miami hotel 
as a result of the lower revenues  noted above  operating expenses at the company s other hotels declined in the present economic slowdown and the uncertainty over its duration have had a negative impact on the hotel industry resulting in steep declines in demand 
as noted above  each of the company s hotels owned for the full year reported declines in operating performance over the prior year 
these general economic trends make it difficult to predict future hotel operating results 
the company s hotel operations may experience further declines in revenues for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  greater than anticipated weakness in the economy and changes in travel patterns 
engineered products the operating results of the company s engineered products segment are as follows table in thousands years ended december  net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss income net sales of the engineered products segment decreased million or for the year ended december  the deterioration in the global economy has negatively impacted business activity in general  and specifically the engineered product markets in which this segment operates 
these conditions had a dramatic impact on global automotive production and  in turn  negatively impacted sales of our automotive product line  which was down approximately from levels 
each of the company s engineered product lines experienced a decline in modest signs of recovery were evident by late and are continuing into  but at levels far below those of and prior 
management remains cautiously optimistic that results will improve as the economy continues to recover 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased for the year ended december   compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in material costs as a percentage of net sales which reflects reductions in the cost of raw materials and changes in the mix of products sold 
this decrease is partially offset by reduced overhead absorption caused by a lower sales levels in  as noted above 
during the year  the company reduced its operating costs  including the elimination of almost of its direct and indirect positions 
management will continue to carefully monitor these costs during selling  general and administrative expenses of the engineered products segment decreased million or for the year ended december   compared to as a result of the significant decline in net sales and personnel reductions noted above  payroll and payroll related expenses  freight charges  and professional fees  were substantially lower than in the economic recession  and in particular its impact on global automotive demand  has caused the company to incur an operating loss from this segment in while recent increases in demand are encouraging  it is uncertain if such recoveries are sustainable for an extended period of time or to what extent the company will benefit from increased automotive demand 
management is closely monitoring this situation and is committed to returning this segment to profitability  but the success of such efforts is uncertain 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses not associated with the manufacturing operations increased  or for the year ended december   compared to such expenses incurred in this increase is primarily as a result of acquisition costs that are not capitalizable  additional payroll and payroll related expenses  as well as from additional depreciation expense total other income expense total other income expense was million in  versus million in the change in total other income expense was primarily related to realized losses on the company s marketable security portfolio of  in versus million in fluctuations also occurred as the result of decreases in interest and dividends generated on the company s cash and marketable security portfolios million and in realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments recognized million 
income taxes in  the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 
in  the effective tax benefit from continuing operations was 
this amount differs from statutorily enacted rates as a result of income or losses in certain state jurisdictions which were not offsettable 
the amount of property gains in a given year  reported net of tax at statuary rates  as discontinued operations  also altered the effective tax rate from continuing operations reported by the company

the operating loss from properties sold and accounted for as discontinued operations in and were  and  on a net of tax basis  respectively 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect results of operations of real properties disposed of during and as discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in operating cash flows results principally from changes in income taxes  including the receipt of million in tax refunds and million less in payments  as well as the reduction in inventories million 
these increases in cash flows are partially offset by lower operating income before depreciation million and interest and dividend income million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in versus  in this change primarily results from lower proceeds received from the sale of real estate assets in the current year million including the release of proceeds held in escrow on the sale of real estate in million  from cash used in a business acquisition  net of cash acquired  in august million  and from the purchase of notes receivable million during the current year 
these uses are offset by the timing of the purchase or sale of available for sale securities million and acquisition of additions to real estate assets million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in versus million which was used for such activities in this change results from a decrease in the purchase and retirement of common stock million during the current year  offset by a reduction in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits million  an increase in principal payments on mortgage obligations million  and lower proceeds from mortgage obligations 
in july  the company purchased a non performing mortgage note encumbering a hotel located in miami  florida the miami hotel 
the company took title to the miami hotel in mid august and has undertaken operation of the hotel 
the company anticipates investing up to million in renovations and improvements to this property during its first year of ownership 
previous purchases of the company s common stock have reduced the company s additional paid in capital to zero and have also reduced retained earnings by amounts in excess of par value 
any future purchases in excess of par value will also reduce retained earnings 
repurchases of the company s common stock may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices and may be made in privately negotiated transactions  subject to available resources 
future proceeds from the issuance of common stock in excess of par value will be credited to retained earnings until such time that previously recorded reductions have been recovered 
at december   the company s cash and marketable securities were million and working capital was million  compared to cash and marketable securities of million and working capital of million at december  while there has been a decline in the value of real estate properties in the united states  the recession could cause real estate prices to drop even further 
management has limited acquisitions to those select properties that meet the company s stringent financial requirements 
management believes that opportunities to acquire additional properties at favorable prices may soon be available and the company s available working capital provides a considerable advantage to fund acquisitions and grow its portfolio  if and when attractive long term opportunities become available 
the tightened credit markets however  could limit the company s ability to leverage future acquisitions 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in to owned joint ventures in which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
the debt of the joint venture in which the company currently has an ownership interest is a non recourse obligation and is collateralized by the entity s real property 
the company believes that the value of the underlying property and its operating cash flows are sufficient to satisfy its obligations 
the company is not obligated for the debts of the joint venture  but could decide to satisfy them in order to protect its investment 
in such event  the company s capital resources and financial condition would be reduced and  in certain instances  the carrying value of the company s investment and its results of operations would be negatively impacted 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated by current operations 
it is expected that future operational cash needs will also be satisfied from existing cash balances  marketable securities  ongoing operations or borrowings 
the primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additional high yield mortgage loans may come from existing funds  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting of cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties in exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company may also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings from institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equity securities 
the company currently has no agreements  commitments or understandings with respect to the acquisition of other companies or the acquisition of real properties in exchange for equity or debt securities 
funds of the company in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates of deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
although these excess funds are invested in investment grade securities  they are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
given the level of cash and other interest bearing investments held by the company  declines in us interest rates have adversely impacted the company s earnings in in strategies designed to hedge overall market risk  the company may sell common stock short or participate in put and or call options 
these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore changes in such derivatives fair value are recognized in earnings 
these derivatives as of december  were recorded as a component of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company held no such derivatives at december  the company recognized  and million in net realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments in and  respectively 
the company sells its engineered products to many customers throughout the world 
historically  a small number of customers have accounted for significant portions of these sales 
for the year ended december   sales by the engineered products segment to general motors  its largest customer  accounted for of the segment s sales 
since our engineered products segment accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  the loss of general motors as a customer  or a significant decline in sales to them  would adversely affect the company s revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
the deterioration in the global economy has negatively impacted business activity in general  and specifically the engineered product markets in which the company operates 
these conditions had a dramatic impact on global automotive production and  in turn  negatively impacted sales of our automotive product line 
modest signs of recovery were evident by late and are continuing into  but at levels far below those of and prior 
management remains cautiously optimistic that results will improve as the economy continues to recover 
continued adverse developments in the automotive industry  including but not limited to continued share declines in demand  customer bankruptcies and increased demands on the company for pricing decreases  have had  and will continue to have  a significant adverse affect on our engineered products segment 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sells its products in those markets as well as europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended december  and  and of the net sales of the company s engineered products segment were denominated in euros  respectively 
as such  a portion of the company s receivables are exposed to fluctuations with the us dollar 
however  the company does not believe this risk to be material to its overall financial position as the company s historical results have not been significantly impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses 
accordingly  the company has not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge this exposure 
if such exposure were to increase in the future  the company may reexamine this practice to minimize the associated risks 
the continued weakness in the economy has pressured results of the company s engineered products and hotel segments 
these factors are expected to continue to impact the company in while the depth and duration of the current negative economic environment and its impact on the company are uncertain  management believes the company s strong balance sheet together with the significant cash flow generated from its core real estate portfolio  should allow the company to weather this downturn 
the plan assets of the company s defined benefit pension plan are valued at fair value using quoted market prices 
investments  in general  are subject to various risks  including credit  interest and overall market volatility 
during  the equity markets saw a significant decline in value 
as such  the fair value of plan assets decreased significantly in that year 
the funded status of the plan at december  decreased by million from december   due in large part to the decrease in the fair value of plan assets 
this affected the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet at december  during  the markets had a significant recovery from the prior year providing an actual return on plan assets of million 
during september  the pension plan was frozen  ceasing the accrual of further benefits 
the plan is now in a funded status  however market fluctuations will continue to effect the need for  and amount of  future contributions 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at the company s two new jersey facilities and has recorded a liability for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associated therewith 
see environmental regulations in item of part i and note  commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this matter 
the company is subject to various other litigation  legal  regulatory and tax matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
when management believes it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and such amounts are reasonably estimable  the company provides for amounts that include judgments and penalties that may be assessed 
these liabilities are usually included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other long term liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  depending on the anticipated payment date 
based on the facts presently available  the company does not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  new or additional facts or an adverse judgment by a court  arbitrator or a settlement could adversely impact the company s results of operations in any given period

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods 
while management believes that the estimates and assumptions used were the most appropriate  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below and should be read in conjunction with the summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its long lived assets and other investments 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of its long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the asset over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the asset 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of the asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of impairments 
pension plan pension plans can be a significant cost of doing business  but represent obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plan and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
the company is required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
these assumptions are used in actuarial calculations to estimate pension costs as well as pension assets or liabilities included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect the company s pension costs and obligations 
the company has assumed the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be in each of the last two years 
based on the company s existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in net periodic pension cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future net periodic pension cost 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have changed fiscal net periodic pension expense by  recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition
