the company may not be able to successfully execute its new long term business strategy 
the company may not be able to successfully execute the long term business strategy that the company announced on october  if the company is not able  on a timely and cost effective basis  to successfully exit certain product lines and divest certain company assets as part of the strategy  the result could be increased costs and diversion of management attention from its focus 
in addition  there is no assurance that the company will be able to drive growth to the extent desired through its focus of efforts and resources on the harley davidson brand or to enhance productivity and profitability to the extent desired through continuous improvement 
expanding international sales subjects the company to risks that may have a material adverse effect on its business 
expanding international sales is a part of the company s long term business strategy 
international operations and sales are subject to various risks  including political and economic instability  local labor market conditions  the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers  the impact of foreign government regulations and the effects of income and withholding taxes  governmental expropriation and differences in business practices 
the company may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international operations and sales that could cause loss of revenues and earnings 
unfavorable changes in the political  regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on the company s net sales  financial condition  profitability or cash flows 
the company must effectively execute the company s restructuring plans within expected costs 
during  the company announced a combination of restructuring actions that are designed to reduce excess capacity  exit non core business operations and lower the company s cost structure 
effectively executing these plans within expected costs and realizing expected benefits will depend upon a number of factors  including the time required to complete planned actions  effective 
table of contents collaboration and agreement with the unions representing the company s employees  the absence of material issues associated with workforce reductions  availability of and effective use of third party service providers to assist in implementing the actions  avoidance of unexpected disruptions in production  retention of key employees involved in implementing the restructuring plans and the ability of the company to sell or lease vacated facilities 
the company sells its products at wholesale and must rely on a network of independent dealers and distributors to manage the retail distribution of its products 
the company depends on the capability of its independent dealers and distributors to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand among retail purchasers for the motorcycles and related products and services that the dealers and distributors purchase from the company 
if the company s independent dealers and distributors are not successful in these endeavors  then the company will be unable to maintain or grow its revenues and meet its financial expectations 
further  independent dealers and distributors may experience difficulty in funding their day to day cash flow needs and paying their obligations because of weakened retail sales and tightening credit 
if dealers are unsuccessful  they may exit or be forced to exit the business or  in some cases  the company may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealerships 
as a result  the company could face additional adverse consequences related to the termination of dealer relationships 
additionally  liquidating a former dealer s inventory of new and used motorcycles can add downward pressure on new and used motorcycle prices 
further  the unplanned loss of any of the company s independent dealers may lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of new motorcycles and for servicing previously sold motorcycles  create negative impressions of the company with its retail customers  and adversely impact the company s ability to collect wholesale receivables that are associated with that dealer 
the company s dealers may experience a further decline in retail sales resulting from general economic conditions  tightening of credit  political events or other factors 
the motorcycle industry has been affected by general economic conditions over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control 
these factors have caused a weaker retail environment leading to weaker demand for discretionary purchases  and the decision to purchase a motorcycle has been and may continue to be affected by these factors 
the related tightening of credit has led to more limited availability of funds from financial institutions and other lenders and sources of capital which has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the ability of retail consumers to obtain loans for the purchase of motorcycles from lenders  including hdfs 
should general economic conditions or motorcycle industry demand continue to decline  our results of operations and financial condition may be further substantially adversely affected 
the motorcycle industry can also be affected by political conditions and other factors over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control 
the company s dealers may experience a further decline in retail sales resulting from declining prices for used motorcycles and excess supplies of new motorcycles 
the company has observed that prices for used harley davidson motorcycles have declined in recent years  which has had and may continue to have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for new harley davidson motorcycles at manufacturer s suggested retail prices 
also  while the company has taken steps designed to reduce production of its new motorcycles in an effort to keep supply in line with demand  the company s competitors could choose to supply additional new motorcycles to the market at reduced prices which could also have the effect of reducing demand for new harley davidson motorcycles at manufacturer s suggested retail prices 
ultimately  reduced demand among retail purchasers for new harley davidson motorcycles leads to reduced shipments by the company 
the company may not be able to successfully execute its manufacturing strategy 
the company s manufacturing strategy is designed to continuously improve product quality  increase productivity  reduce costs and increase flexibility to respond to changes in the marketplace 
the company believes flexible manufacturing  including flexible supply chains and flexible labor agreements  is the key element to enable improvements in the company s ability to respond to customers in a cost effective manner 
to implement this strategy  the company must be successful in its continuous improvement 
table of contents efforts which are dependent on the involvement of management  production employees and suppliers 
any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of the company s products and its ability to deliver the right product at the right time to the customer 
the company and its independent dealers must balance the economies of level production with a more seasonal retail sales pattern 
the company generally records the sale of a motorcycle when it is shipped to the company s independent dealers and distributors 
in the past few years  increased availability of harley davidson motorcycles has resulted in the timing of retail purchases tracking more closely with regional motorcycle riding seasons 
the seasonality of the company s wholesale shipments affects its ability to continue to maintain relatively level production  inventories and shipments throughout the year 
as a result  the company and its independent dealers and distributors must balance the economies of level production with the inventory and other costs associated with a more seasonal retail sales pattern 
failure to balance the two  or any failure of the company to adequately adjust its methods of distributing motorcycles among its independent dealers and distributors  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company relies on third party suppliers to obtain raw materials and provide component parts for use in the manufacture of its motorcycles 
the company cannot be certain that it will not experience supply problems such as unfavorable pricing or untimely delivery of raw materials and components 
in certain circumstances  the company relies on a single supplier to provide the entire requirement of a specific part  and a change in this established supply relationship may cause disruption in the company s production schedule 
in addition  the price and availability of raw materials and component parts from suppliers can be adversely affected by factors outside of the company s control such as the supply of a necessary raw material 
further  company suppliers may experience difficulty due to financial market disruption in funding their day to day cash flow needs because of tightening credit  and those suppliers who also serve the automotive industry may be experiencing financial difficulties due to a downturn in that industry  which could adversely affect their ability to supply the company 
these supplier risks may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
government actions to stabilize credit markets in are scheduled to end in which could have a negative impact on capital markets 
in  the us government enacted legislation and created several programs to help stabilize credit markets and financial institutions and restore liquidity  including the federal reserve s commercial paper funding facility cpff and the federal reserve bank of new york s term asset backed securities loan facility talf program  both of which are scheduled to expire in the expiration of these programs could have a negative impact on capital markets and limit the company s access to capital market funding 
these negative consequences may in turn adversely affect the company s business and results of operations in various ways  including through higher costs of capital  reduced funds available through its financial services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers  and dilution to existing shareholders through the use of alternative sources of capital 
the company s financial services operations rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations 
liquidity is essential to the company s financial services business 
the disruptions in the financial markets since have caused many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and  in some cases  cease to loan money to borrowers including financial institutions 
the disruption has affected and could continue to affect the company s choice of financing sources and its ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all 
the company s financial services operations may be negatively affected by the difficulty in raising funding in the long term and short term capital markets 
these negative consequences may in turn adversely affect the company s business and results of operations in various ways  including through higher costs of capital  reduced funds available through its financial services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers  and dilution to existing shareholders through the use of alternative sources of capital 

table of contents the company s financial services operations are highly dependent on accessing capital markets to fund their operations at competitive interest rates  the company s access to capital and its cost of capital are highly dependent upon its credit ratings  and any negative credit rating actions will adversely affect its earnings and results of operations 
the ability of the company and its financial services operations to access unsecured capital markets is influenced by their short term and long term credit ratings 
if the company s credit ratings are downgraded or its ratings outlook is negatively changed  the company s cost of borrowing will increase  resulting in reduced earnings and interest margins  or the company s access to capital may be disrupted or impaired 
the company s financial services operations are exposed to credit risk on its retail and wholesale receivables 
credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a failure by a customer to meet the terms of any contract with the company s financial services operations 
credit losses are influenced by general business and economic conditions  including unemployment rates  bankruptcy filings and other factors that negatively affect household incomes  as well as contract terms  customer credit profiles and the new and used motorcycle market 
the market turmoil since has resulted in the tightening of credit  a lack of consumer confidence  unemployment and increased market volatility  all of which have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies 
the company s financial services operations had higher retail receivables outstanding during as compared to  due to a reduction in off balance sheet term asset backed securitization activity throughout and the utilization of on balance sheet term asset backed securitizations during  and therefore retained increased on balance sheet credit risk from retail receivables 
further negative changes in general business  economic or market factors may have an additional adverse impact on the company s financial services credit losses and future earnings 
for example  the company s financial services operations conduct business primarily in the united states and  as a result of recessionary conditions in the united states economy  delinquencies on receivables that the company s financial services operations owns or services have increased 
credit losses have increased as a result of a higher frequency of loss and higher average loss per harley davidson branded motorcycle resulting from continued pressure on values for repossessed harley davidson branded motorcycles 
in addition  if there are adverse circumstances that involve a material decline in values of harley davidson branded motorcycles  those circumstances or any related decline in resale values for harley davidson branded motorcycles could contribute to increased delinquencies and credit losses 
the company has a number of competitors of varying sizes that are based both inside and outside the united states some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
many of the company s competitors are more diversified than the company  and they may compete in the automotive market or all segments of the motorcycle market 
also  the company s manufacturer s suggested retail price for its motorcycles is generally higher than its competitors  and if price becomes a more important competitive factor for consumers in the heavyweight motorcycle market  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage 
in addition  the company s financial services operations face competition from various banks  insurance companies and other financial institutions that may have access to additional sources of capital at more competitive rates and terms  particularly for borrowers in higher credit tiers 
failure to adequately address and respond to these competitive pressures worldwide and in the us may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s marketing strategy of appealing to and growing sales to multi generational and multi cultural customers worldwide may not continue to be successful 
the company has been successful in marketing its products in large part by promoting the experience of motorcycling 
to sustain and grow the business over the long term  the company must continue to be successful selling products and promoting the experience of motorcycling to both core customers and outreach customers such as women  young adults and ethnically diverse adults 
the company s success depends upon the continued strength of the harley davidson brand 
the company believes that the harley davidson brand has significantly contributed to the success of its 
table of contents business and that maintaining and enhancing the brand is critical to expanding its customer base 
failure to protect the brand from infringers or to grow the value of the harley davidson brand may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s ability to remain competitive is dependent upon its capability to develop and successfully introduce new  innovative and compliant products 
the motorcycle market continues to advance in terms of cutting edge styling and new technology and  at the same time  be subject to increasing regulations related to safety and emissions 
the company must continue to distinguish its products from its competitors products with unique styling and new technologies and to protect its intellectual property from imitators 
in addition  these new products must comply with applicable regulations worldwide and satisfy the potential demand for products that produce lower emissions 
the company must make product advancements while maintaining the classic look  sound and feel associated with harley davidson products 
the company must also be able to design and manufacture these products and deliver them to the marketplace in an efficient and timely manner 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these endeavors or that existing and prospective customers will like or want the company s new products 
the company s motorcycles segment is dependent upon unionized labor 
substantially all of the hourly employees working in the motorcycles segment are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements 
harley davidson motor company is currently a party to five collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers and the united steelworkers of america that expire march   july  and february  these collective bargaining agreements generally cover wages  healthcare benefits and retirement plans  seniority  job classes and work rules 
there is no certainty that the company will be successful in negotiating new agreements with these unions that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that these new agreements will be on terms as favorable to the company as past labor agreements 
failure to renew these agreements when they expire or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to the company and the unions could result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions which may have a material adverse effect on customer relationships and the company s business and results of operations 
the company s operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled employees  including executive officers 
the company s future success depends on its continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate and retain skilled personnel for all areas of its organization 
the company s current and future total compensation arrangements  which include benefits and cash bonuses  may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating the company s existing employees 
if the company does not succeed in attracting personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel  including executive officers  the company may be unable to develop and distribute products and services and effectively execute its plans and strategies 
the company incurs substantial costs with respect to employee pension and healthcare benefits 
the company s cash funding requirements and its estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and healthcare benefits for both active and retired employees are based on several factors that are outside the company s control 
these factors include funding requirements of the pension protection act of  the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the rate of return on plan assets  medical costs  retirement age and mortality 
changes in these factors can impact the expense and cash requirements associated with these benefits which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations  liquidity or shareholders equity 
in addition  costs associated with these benefits put the company under significant cost pressure as compared to our competitors that may not bear the costs of similar benefit plans 
the company manufactures products that create exposure to product liability claims and litigation 
to the extent plaintiffs are successful in showing that personal injury or property damage result from defects in the design or manufacture of the company s products  the company may be 
table of contents subject to claims for damages that are not covered by insurance 
the costs associated with defending product liability claims  including frivolous lawsuits  and payment of damages could be substantial 
the company s reputation may also be adversely affected by such claims  whether or not successful 
the company must maintain its reputation of being a good corporate citizen and treating customers  employees  suppliers and other stakeholders fairly 
the company has a history of good corporate governance 
prior to the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of the act  the company had in place many of the corporate governance procedures and processes now mandated by the act and related rules and regulations  such as board committee charters and a corporate governance policy 
in  the company established a code of business conduct that defines how employees interact with various company stakeholders and addresses issues such as confidentiality  conflict of interest and fair dealing 
failure to maintain this reputation may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company must invest in and successfully implement new information systems and technology 
the company is continually modifying and enhancing its systems and technology to increase productivity and efficiency 
when implemented  the systems and technology may not provide the benefits anticipated and could add costs and complications to ongoing operations  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes 
these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm the company s business  financial condition  reputation and brand 
the defense of the lawsuits may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  any such payment may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
refer to the company s disclosures concerning legal proceedings in the periodic reports that the company files with the securities and exchange commission for additional detail regarding lawsuits and other claims against the company

table of contents imposed by the epa  state regulatory agencies  such as california air resources board  and regulatory agencies in certain foreign countries where the company s motorcycle products are sold 
the company is also subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise in the conduct of the company s manufacturing operations 
any significant change to the regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise may substantially increase the cost of manufacturing the company s products 
further  in response to concerns about global climate changes  the company may face greater regulatory or customer pressure to develop products that generate less emissions 
this may require the company to spend additional funds on research  product development  implementation costs and subject the company to the risk that the company s competitors may respond to these pressures in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage 
the company s financial services operations are governed by various foreign  federal and state laws that more specifically affect general financial and lending institutions 
the financial services operations originate the majority of its consumer loans through its subsidiary  eaglemark savings bank  a nevada state thrift chartered as an industrial loan company 
the us congress is currently considering several proposals that would impose additional regulation and supervision over the financial services industry 
for example  the us house financial services committee has prepared a discussion draft of legislation that would impose additional oversight over the financial parent of an industrial loan company 
this additional oversight may include regulation of hdfs and or its subsidiaries by the federal reserve board in addition to its current regulators  the fdic and state banking authorities 
failure to comply with these regulations  changes in these or other regulations  or the imposition of additional regulations  could affect hdfs earnings  limit its access to capital  limit the number of loans eligible for hdfs securitization programs and have a material adverse effect on hdfs business and results of operations 
in addition  the company is also subject to policies and actions of the new york stock exchange nyse

york environmental matters the company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters  including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its york  pennsylvania facility 
the york facility was formerly used by the us navy and amf prior to the purchase of the york facility by the company from amf in although the company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the york facility  it has been working with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep since in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities  including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs 
in january  the company entered into a settlement agreement the agreement with the navy 
the agreement calls for the navy and the company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to and  respectively  of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the york facility response costs 
the trust administers the payment of the response costs incurred at the york facility as covered by the agreement 
in february  the company was advised by the epa that it considers some of the company s remediation activities at the york facility to be subject to the epa s corrective action program under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and offered the company the option of addressing corrective action under a rcra facility lead agreement 
in july  the york facility was designated as the first site in pennsylvania to be addressed under the one cleanup program 
the program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both padep and epa and will be carried out consistent with the agreement with the navy 
as a result  the rcra facility lead agreement has been superseded 
although the ri fs is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the york facility  the company estimates that its share of the future response costs at the york facility will be approximately million 
the company has established reserves for this amount  which are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the estimate of the company s future response costs that will be incurred at the york facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the company  the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities 
response costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in response costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond

table of contents interest income benefited from higher average retail and wholesale receivables outstanding  partially offset by lower wholesale lending rates 
the increase in retail receivables outstanding was driven by a reduction in off balance sheet term asset backed securitization activity throughout due to capital market volatility and the utilization of on balance sheet term asset backed securitization structures during the increase in wholesale outstanding receivables resulted from an increased use of floorplan financing combined with a higher number of average days financed 
interest expense was higher in due primarily to increased borrowings to support the higher average outstanding retail and wholesale receivables as well as an increased cost of borrowing as compared to during  hdfs recorded a loss from securitizations compared to income from securitizations during the change from was due to reduced income earned from the investment in retained securitization interests and a larger other than temporary write down of certain retained securitization interests in compared to income earned from the investment in retained securitization interests was million lower due to a reduction in outstanding off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions

key assumptions include expected losses  prepayment speed and discount rate 
hdfs determines these assumptions by reviewing historical trends and current economic conditions 
given the challenging us economy  credit losses on hdfs retail installment loans have increased  and as a result  the fair value of retained securitization interests has declined  and in some cases this decline is other than temporary 
a write down in the retained securitization interest generally represents a non cash charge in the period in which it is recorded  but ultimately represents a reduction in the residual cash flow that hdfs expects to receive from its investment in retained securitization interests 
the fair value of the investment in retained securitization interests was million at december  other income remained relatively flat in compared to during  the company recognized a million charge to earnings for the lower of cost or market valuation adjustment of its finance receivables held for sale prior to the reclassification to finance receivables held for investment as discussed below 
this compares to a lower of cost or market valuation charge of million in this change was partially offset by a million decrease in servicing fee income resulting from fewer outstanding off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions and lower insurance commissions in compared to the increase in the provision for credit losses during primarily resulted from the reclassification of billion of finance receivables held for sale to finance receivables held for investment at the end of the second quarter of the reclassification was due to the structure of the company s may term asset backed securitization transaction and management s intent to structure subsequent securitization transactions in a manner that would not meet the requirements of accounting sale treatment 
the reclassification resulted in an additional provision for credit losses of million 
in addition  the provisions for credit losses related to retail receivables and wholesale receivables increased by million and million  respectively  over the increase was primarily the result of higher expected incidence of loss  lower expected recovery values on repossessed motorcycles  and an increase in the finance receivables held for investment

table of contents the company is required to adopt the new guidance contained within asc and asc as of january  the new guidance will require consolidation of the existing qualifying special purpose entities qspes that are not currently recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet  resulting in an estimated increase in finance receivables and debt of billion 
consolidation of currently unconsolidated qspes will also result in an increase in the allowance for finance credit losses for newly consolidated finance receivables along with changes to the timing and line item reporting of income and expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  as part of the consolidation of these finance receivable securitization trusts  the investment in retained securitization interests will be eliminated and no future valuations will be required 
in accordance with the new guidance  the company will initially measure the assets and liabilities of the former qspes at their carrying values the amounts at which the asset and liabilities would have been carried in the consolidated financial statements if asc topic had been effective when the company first met the conditions as the primary beneficiary 
the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards as of january   based on financial information as of december   would result in an estimated aggregate after tax charge to retained earnings in the range of million to million  which includes the impact of establishing the initial allowance for finance credit losses

critical accounting estimates the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the company s financial condition and results of operations

goodwill the company reviews its goodwill for impairment  based on financial data related to the reporting unit to which it has been assigned  at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill must be adjusted to its implied fair value 
in determining the fair value of a reporting unit  the company utilizes widely accepted techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies which require the company to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate macro economic factors  industry economic factors and the future profitability of current business strategies 
changes in these factors can have a significant impact on the impairment evaluation 
asset groups to be disposed of by sale asset groups assets and liabilities to be disposed of together as a group in a single transaction classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and a loss should be recognized for any initial adjustment required to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met 
the fair value less cost to sell must be assessed each reporting period the asset group remains classified as held for sale 
gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of an asset group will be recognized on the date of sale 
in determining the fair value of an asset group representing a business  the company utilizes widely accepted techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies which require the company to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate macro economic factors  industry economic factors and the future profitability of current business strategies 
changes in these factors can have a significant impact on the impairment evaluation 
in addition  the determination of fair value for an asset group held for sale may be influenced by information received from market participants interested buyers having appropriate knowledge of the asset group 
the appropriate level of knowledge may not be obtainable solely from public observations  but could be obtained in the course of a normal due diligence process

pensions and other postretirement benefits the company has several defined benefit pension plans and several postretirement healthcare benefit plans  which cover substantially all employees of the motorcycles segment 
the company also has unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan agreements serpa with certain employees which were instituted to replace benefits lost under the tax revenue reconciliation act of pension  serpa and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs are calculated through actuarial valuations 
the valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets  future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates 

table of contents the company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations 
based on this analysis  the discount rate for pension and serpa obligations was decreased from as of december  to as of december  the discount rate for postretirement healthcare obligations was decreased from to 
the company determines its healthcare trend assumption for the postretirement healthcare obligation by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation  the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants 
based on the company s assessment of this data as of december   the company lowered its healthcare cost trend rate to from as of december  the company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of beginning in these assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods 
the following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions in thousands amounts based on current assumptions impact of a decrease in the discount rate impact of a increase in the healthcare cost trend rate net periodic benefit costs pension and serpa   n a postretirement healthcare benefit obligations pension and serpa   n a postretirement healthcare this information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts 
the calculation of pension  serpa and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here 
this information should be considered in combination with the information provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock compensation costs the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted adjusted for forfeitures 
this cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures 
as a result  changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
the company estimates the fair value of option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options  including stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
the valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the company uses a weighted average of historical and implied volatility to determine the expected volatility of its stock 
the implied volatility is derived from options that are actively traded and the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee share options 
in addition  the traded options have exercise prices that are both a near the money and b close to the exercise price of the employee share options 
finally  the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year 

table of contents dividend yield was based on the company s expected dividend payments and the risk free rate was based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the cost of an individual option 
however  the total cost of an award is also a function of the number of awards granted  and as result  the company has the ability to control the cost of its equity awards by adjusting the number of awards granted
