table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  contingencies  inventory valuation  warranty accrual and stock based compensation expense 
in conjunction with acquisitions  we allocate investment costs based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated product returns is established at the time of sale based upon historical return rates adjusted for current economic conditions 
historically  we have experienced an insignificant amount of sales returns 
we generally recognize revenue when goods are shipped to our distributors in accordance with standard contract terms that pass title of all goods upon delivery to a common carrier fob factory and provide for sales returns under standard product warranty provisions 
for non standard contract terms where title to goods passes at time of delivery fob destination  revenue is recognized after we have established proof of delivery 
revenues relating to services performed under our extended warranty program represent less than of net revenues in each of  and and are recognized as earned based upon contract terms  generally ratable over the term of service 
we record project installation work in asia using the percentage of completion method 
installation revenue represents less than of net revenue in  and net revenues include amounts billed to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling 
shipping fees represent less than of net revenues in each of  and shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
accounts receivable  trade notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we grant credit to our customers after undertaking an investigation of credit risk for all significant amounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for estimated credit losses at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowance is based on reviews of loss  adjustments history  current economic conditions and other factors that deserve recognition in estimating potential losses 
we generally do not require collateral for sales on credit 
while management uses the best information available in making our determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts receivable is also dependent upon future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
if there was a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or if actual defaults were higher than what have been experienced historically  additional allowances would be required 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial stability of our customers 
any material change in the financial status of any one or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
trade notes receivables are presented to us from some of our customers in china as a payment against the outstanding trade receivables 
these notes receivables are bank guarantee promissory notes which are non interest bearing and generally mature within months 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in the market  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
when recorded  reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of the inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for specified products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the recoverability is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit  which is measured based upon  among other factors  market capitalization as well as forecasted operating results 
we have one reporting unit 
if the recorded value of the assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  and liabilities net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss may exist 
further  to the extent our consolidated net book value is greater than our market capitalization  all  or a significant portion of any goodwill may be impaired 
we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization during the fourth quarter of this decline in market capitalization was driven largely by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that contributed to a decline in our forecasted operating results and business 
as a result  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of approximately million for the three month period and year ended december  to write off the entire carrying value of goodwill 
long lived assets we test long lived asset groups for recoverability when events occur or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amounts of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
stock based compensation expense we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using a black scholes merton bsm valuation model and a single option award approach 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognized in expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we make the following estimates and assumptions in determining fair value expected term our expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
we have used the historical exercise patterns of previously granted options in relation to the company s stock price to estimate expected exercise patterns 
expected volatility the company s expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock  adjusted where determined by management for unusual and non representative stock price activity not expected to recur 
management determined the historical stock price volatility for period from april   the commencement of public trading of the common stock  through december   was not likely to be representative of the future and excluded this period 
management also applies mean reversion techniques to the historical stock prices  which results in an emphasis on recent activity over the distant past  when determining the expected volatility rate to be included in the black scholes merton valuation model 

table of contents expected dividend the black scholes merton valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input 
the company currently pays no dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
risk free interest rate the company bases the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
estimated forfeitures to estimate forfeitures  we apply our historical rate of option forfeitures 
estimated forfeiture rates are trued up to actual forfeiture results as the stock based awards vest 
business combinations in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and is inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  acquired developed technologies and pending patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited  stock compensation expenses  under asc  stock compensation  which are not deductible for tax purposes and changes in our valuation allowances 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations net sales percentage percentage change change change change in thousands net sales net sales during decreased million  or  from million in the decease was primarily the result of a decrease in net sales of million  or  in americas  million  or  in asia and 
table of contents million  or  in europe 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the negative impact of the worldwide economic downturn during the first half of and disruption of our sales activity in china due to management changes at our fushun and beijing operations 
we believe these two factors negatively impacted our sales by approximately million in the first nine months of additionally  the decrease in resulted from the impact of two significant non recurring orders in totaling approximately million one from the united states national guard and another from the beijing international airport 
approximately million of the decrease was due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations 
net sales during increased million  or  from million in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net sales of million and million in the americas and europe  respectively  offset by a decrease of net sales in asia by million 
the increase from to consisted primarily of two large non recurring orders in totaling approximately million one from the united states national guard and another from the beijing international airport 
additional increases in net sales of approximately million were due to the appreciation of the renminbi rmb and euro against the us dollar from to the increase was partially offset by an economic slow down in china following the beijing olympics  in the second half of cost of sales and gross profit percentage percentage change change change change in thousands cost of sales gross profit gross margin cost of sales consists of direct material  labor and overhead 
cost of sales in decreased million or from million in the decrease in cost of sales was primarily the result of a decrease in net sales from million in to million in the gross margin change to in from in was primarily the result of the year over year decline in revenue  particularly in the americas and europe  regions where we generally sell higher margin products

sales and marketing expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands sales and marketing percentage of net sales sales and marketing expenses in decreased million  or  from million in the decrease was primarily due to reduced headcount  travel by employees and participation at trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses in decreased million or from million in the decrease was primarily due to company wide cost control initiatives and a ten percent workforce reduction in the americas  at the end of the first quarter of additional savings were realized by decreases in office expenses  advertising and trade show expenses  travel and entertainment expenses  consultant expenses and project expenses 

table of contents research and development expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands research and development percentage of net sales research and development expenses in decreased million  or  from million in the decrease was primarily the result of a business tax exemption from the prc granted to rae shanghai for engineering services provided by rae shanghai to rae asia and lower project related expenses  partially offset by an increase in payroll expenses due to an increase in headcount 
research and development expenses in decreased million or from million in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in amortization expense as certain intangible assets were fully amortized and a million decrease in project expenses due to completion of certain r d projects in general and administrative expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands general and administrative percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses in increased million from million in while general and administrative expenses were relatively constant during and  management accrued million as its estimate to settle the outstanding joint investigation into the company s alleged violations of the fcpa and increased bad debt expense associated with doubtful accounts receivable of million  which was offset by lower professional fees of million  consisting primarily of legal fees 
general and administrative expenses in increased million or from in the increase was primarily due to a net increase of million in professional service expenses 
the charge was comprised of a million increase related to the previously disclosed fcpa investigation and related remediation plans conducted under the supervision of the audit committee of the board of directors  offset by a decrease in legal costs associated with the conclusion of the polimaster arbitration in bad debt expenses increased by million due to an increase in accounts receivable reserves at rae fushun and rae beijing

the change of million income in net other during was primarily from foreign exchange gains in asia and europe 
the expense increase of million in equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents the company s share in the unconsolidated losses of its investments in various businesses 
for  total other expenses increased million or from million in the increase was primarily due to increases in foreign exchange losses from balances and payments in euro and rmb  offset by decreases in interest expenses as we repaid our outstanding loan balance using funds from sale of the san jose building 
income tax benefit expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands income tax benefit expense effective tax rate income tax expense decreased million from an income tax expense of million in our effective tax rate was in and in the tax rate for years and differed from united states statutory rate due to the realization of certain deferred tax assets dtas  foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited and non deductible stock compensation deductions 
in november  the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was enacted 
under this law  companies may elect to increase the carryback period for the net operating loss of a tax year ending after december  and beginning before january  to  or years 
accordingly  we have elected to carry our net operating loss back to  which will result in a refund of approximately  we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from anticipated net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance for all deferred assets except for million related to certain of our foreign entities 
based on our current projections  we believe it is more likely than not we will not be able realize our deferred tax assets with the exception of the million foreign deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes  requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized and that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative 
table of contents evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  cumulative losses weighed heavily in the overall assessment 
we believe that sufficient uncertainty exists with regard to the realizability of these tax assets such that a valuation allowance is necessary 
factors considered in providing a valuation allowance include the lack of a significant history of consistent profits  the current and believed to be continued weakness in the overall market thereby potentially impacting our ability to sustain or grow revenues and earnings  and the length of carryback and carryforward periods 
we considered expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
based on the absence of sufficient positive objective verifiable evidence at december   we have placed a valuation on our deferred tax assets except for million of foreign deferred tax assets 
we expect to record a valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our future results of operations 
our effective tax rate was a tax expense in and tax in the tax rate for and differed from the united states statutory rate due to the change in the realization of our deferred tax assets  foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited  and non deductible stock compensation deductions

our mobile dvr business was acquired through the purchases of aegison and securay 
see note business combinations and dispositions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details 
on august   we notified our dvr customers  terminated all personnel not reassigned to continuing operations and suspended the related production and sales activities 
because the dvr business operates at a substantial loss  management intended to liquidate the tangible assets  mainly inventories of component parts 
accordingly  the value of these assets had been adjusted to reflect the anticipated disposals 
as a result of discontinuing the dvr business  management impaired the remaining value of the intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the purchases of aegison in july and securay in january impairment expense recognized in fiscal totaled million 

table of contents in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance  the financial results of the dvr business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the financial results included in discontinued operations were as follows liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through operating revenues  proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and short term bank borrowings 
in  we also sold and leased back our corporate headquarters in san jose  california 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared with million on december  the million year over year increase in company cash was due in part to our global initiatives to reduce worldwide inventory levels 
on december   we had million in working capital current assets less current liabilities and a current ratio ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of to on december  of the million reduction in working capital  million is attributable to the proposed fcpa settlement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the united states  we had a million revolving credit agreement as of december   and a million revolving credit agreement as of december  this credit facility is renewed annually and currently expires on may  available credit is based on a percentage of specific qualifying assets and the total facility is collateralized by a blanket security interest over the company s assets in the united states 
we are required to comply with certain reporting and financial requirements in addition to the ongoing requirement to submit monthly financial information 
we must also maintain a compensating balance with the lending bank of at least million at all times  which is included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets 
while we intend to pursue renewal  there is no assurance we will be successful in securing a renewed agreement on this line of credit for any time period after may  as of december  and december   million was outstanding against the revolving credit agreements in the united states 
during the fourth quarter of  the company obtained an amendment to the financial covenants of its revolving credit agreement  as a result of non compliance 
the amended financial covenants under the revolving credit agreement require us to maintain specified trailing two quarter minimum earnings before interest  depreciation  amortization and non cash stock compensation expenses and limits the size of potential monetary penalties under the fcpa to million 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  in china  we had two unsecured revolving lines of credit as of december  and december   each in the amount of rmb million or approximately million 
borrowings under these lines of credit are available to provide working capital and are generally at the current market rate for fixed rate loans of the amount and duration requested  up to one year 
the continuing credit facilities are renewed annually 
as of december  and december   rmb million  or approximately million  and rmb million  or approximately million  respectively  was outstanding against loan agreements in china 
in november  we borrowed rmb million  or approximately million  for a term of months to provide working capital for our owned subsidiary in fushun  china rae fushun 
loan repayment is guaranteed by an unrelated third party  to whom rae fushun granted a lien over its wholly owned plant and associated land rights 
as a condition of the loan  the lending bank required a deposit of approximately million from the guarantor 
this deposit was funded by rae fushun from the loan proceeds and is included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets 
we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from product sales  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including the size  timing and structure of any future acquisitions  future capital investments  the ultimate resolution of potential fcpa violations and future results of operations 
any future financing we may require may be unavailable on favorable terms  if at all 
any difficulty in obtaining additional financial resources could force us to curtail our operations or could prevent us from pursuing our growth strategy 
any future funding may dilute the ownership of our shareholders

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which applies to business combinations 
the new guidance changes the accounting for acquisition transaction costs by requiring them to be expensed in the period incurred  and also changes the accounting for contingent consideration  acquired contingencies and restructuring costs related to an acquisition 
the new guidance was effective for the company beginning january   and will change the company s accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie and requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
under this guidance  an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the guidance also requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a vie operates as designed when determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance

the company is currently assessing the potential effect  if any  on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk currently  we have cash and cash equivalents deposited with major financial institutions in the countries where we conduct business 
our deposits may exceed the amount of insurance available to cover such deposits 
to date  we 
table of contents have not experienced any losses of deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
management regularly reviews our deposit balances and the credit worthiness of the financial institutions which hold our deposits 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of million 
the company had no other significant interest bearing assets 
over time changes to interest rates may reduce or increase our interest income  but the impact on our net income loss or the fair value of our interest bearing assets is not expected to be significant 
our borrowings in china are at fixed interest rates or at rates fixed for months 
the outstanding balance under our line of credit in the united states bears interest at the floating prime bank lending rate plus basis points subject to a minimum total rate of 
as the prime rate as of december  was  our cost of funds in the united states will not increase until the prime rate rises by more than basis points 
on an outstanding balance of million  the loan balance in the united states on december   annual interest expense would increase by  for each basis point thereafter 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   a substantial portion of our recognized revenue was denominated in us dollars generated primarily from customers in the americas 
revenue generated from our european operations was primarily in euros  revenue generated by our asia operations was primarily in rmb 
we manufacture a majority of our component parts at our manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
since january  our operations in china have been affected by currency fluctuations due to an approximate appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
our strategy has been and will continue to be to increase our overseas manufacturing and research and development activities to capitalize on lower cost capacity and efficiencies in supply chain management 
in and  we made a strategic investment with the acquisition of a interest in rae beijing  a beijing based manufacturer and distributor of environmental safety and security equipment  and the formation of rae fushun in late to capitalize on increases in demand for safety equipment in the mining and energy sectors in china 
there has been continued speculation in the financial press that china s currency  the rmb  will be subject to a further market adjustment relative to the us dollar and other currencies 
if  for example  there was a hypothetical change in the rmb relative to the us dollar  the effect on our loss would have been approximately million for fiscal if the currencies in all other countries in europe and asia where we have operations were to change in unison with the rmb by a hypothetical relative to the us dollar  the effect on our loss would have been approximately million for fiscal the difference of million is attributable to the impact of foreign currencies outside of china 
to the extent that we have international sales denominated in us dollars  any fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could affect our competitive position in the international markets 
although we continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot be certain that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
