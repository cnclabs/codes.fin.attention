in order to evaluate the performance of these operating segments internally  we use net revenues and ebitda as key performance measures of the results of operations 
furthermore  we believe that the use of these measures enables us and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner 
because we use ebitda as a key performance measure of financial performance  we are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to provide the information concerning ebitda 
however  these measures should not be considered as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net earnings as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as a measure of our operating results or cash flows as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or as a measure of our liquidity 
during  the continuing overall weakness in the us economy has resulted in considerable negative pressure on consumer spending 
as a result  pari mutuel wagering and gaming businesses  which are driven  in part  by discretionary spending and industry competition  continued to weaken and contributed to a decline in our pari mutuel handle of during the year ended december  compared to the same period of total handle for the pari mutuel industry  according to figures published by equibase  declined during the year ended december  compared to the same period of although there is a growing confidence that the global economies have resumed growth  there remains risk that the recovery will be short lived  such recovery may not include the industries or markets in which we conduct our business  or the downturn may resume 
there is a strong likelihood that the recent significant economic downturn has had  and for the foreseeable future will continue to have  a negative impact on our financial performance 
we believe that  despite uncertain economic conditions  we are in a strong financial position 
during december  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the second amendment  which amended and restated our previous credit agreement and increased the maximum aggregate commitment from million to million with an option to increase the aggregate commitment up to million

during  we sold our ownership interest in hoosier park 
we made the decision to sell hoosier park in order to dispose of an asset which we considered to be underperforming in order to strengthen our balance sheet and focus on future growth and potential diversification opportunities

capital spending incurred to construct this facility as of december  
table of contents totaled million and is anticipated to approximate million when complete 
in accordance with the relevant legislation  during the year ended december   we submitted payments of million for an annual license fee and million for an annual problem gaming fund fee

we incurred loan origination costs of million in connection with our entry into the second amendment  which have been capitalized and will be amortized as interest expense over the term of the second amendment 
the facility terminates on december  and contains customary financial and other covenant requirements  including specific interest coverage and leverage ratios  as well as minimum required levels of net worth 
the covenants permit us to use proceeds of the credit extended under the second amendment for general corporate purposes and acquisition needs 
youbet 
com merger during november  we announced that we had entered into a merger agreement with youbet 
com  inc youbet under which we plan to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of youbet in a transaction valued at approximately million based on the closing price of our common stock on february  under the terms of the transaction  youbet shareholders will receive a fixed ratio of shares of the company plus in cash for each share of youbet common stock  subject to possible future adjustment to the exchange ratio to increase the cash consideration and correspondingly decrease the stock consideration in order to ensure that the transaction does not require us to issue more than of our outstanding common stock prior to the transaction 
this transaction is expected to qualify as tax deferred under section of the internal revenue code 
after completion of the transaction  which is currently expected to occur during the first half of  based on the closing price of our common stock on february   youbet shareholders are expected to own approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
however  we cannot predict the actual timing of the completion of the merger or whether the merger will actually be completed 
receipt of illinois riverboat subsidy during december  we received a payment of million from the horse racing equity trust fund the hre trust fund related to subsidies paid by illinois riverboat casinos in accordance with public act the hre trust fund was established to fund operating and capital improvements at illinois racetracks via a surcharge on revenues of illinois riverboat casinos that meet a predetermined revenue threshold 
the funds are to be distributed with of the total to be used for horsemen s purses and the remaining of the total to be distributed to illinois racetracks 
the monies received have been placed into an escrow account of arlington park and are recognized as restricted cash 
revenues from these subsidies are being deferred as of december   as challenges regarding the constitutionality of public act are still being made by certain illinois riverboat casinos 
acquisition of land from a related party during november  we entered into an agreement with duchossois industries  inc dii to purchase approximately sixty seven acres of real estate adjacent to arlington park for use in backside operations 
dii beneficially owns more than of our common stock 
the total purchase price of million was financed by 
table of contents a cash payment of million and the issuance of an unsecured promissory note of million  payable to dii  which will mature on may  and does not bear interest 
the agreement was executed pursuant to arlington park s exercise of a purchase option granted under the original lease of the land with dii 
khbpa settlement on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with the kentucky horsemen s benevolent and protective association  inc the khbpa related to a lawsuit styled churchill downs incorporated  calder race course  inc  churchill downs technology initiatives company vs 
thoroughbred horsemen s group  llc the thg lawsuit 
we agreed to dismiss our claims in the thg lawsuit against the khbpa  with prejudice  and also agreed to provide a million supplement to the purse account of churchill downs to be paid evenly over the next three years 
we are authorized to distribute a greater share of the supplement early in the three year period should purses at churchill downs fall below anticipated levels 
the khbpa agreed to dismiss its counterclaims against us  with prejudice 
we recorded million of purse expense during the year ended december  as a result of the settlement with the khbpa 
income taxes we are currently under examination by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years  including federal income tax audits for calendar years through during and  we received approximately million of proceeds related to the sale of personal seat licenses sold in connection with the renovation of churchill downs 
the personal seat licenses that were sold included those with terms of years and years and provided the purchaser the right to purchase tickets to the kentucky derby  kentucky oaks and any breeders cup races each year during the term of the license 
accordingly  for tax purposes  we deferred the income for the personal seat licenses over the respective terms of the licenses 
during the year ended december   the internal revenue service the irs proposed that the income related to the sale of the personal seat licenses is taxable during the period we received the proceeds the proposed audit adjustment 
as a result  the proposed audit adjustment serves to increase the amount of the income taxes due for each of the years and we intend to defend our position of deferring income related to the sale of personal seat licenses using a fast track mediation process offered by the irs 
however  it is uncertain at this time whether the fast track mediation process will be made available to us by the irs 
if the proposed audit adjustment is upheld  we estimate it could have a potential total negative cash impact of up to million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million  which represents amounts due at both the state and federal levels 
if we are unable to resolve this matter through the fast track mediation process  or if the fast track mediation process is not available  we would expect to receive a notice of tax deficiency from the irs 
upon receiving the notice  we would have the following options file a written protest and request for an appeals conference with the irs within days 
in this case  payments would not be required until a decision is made in the appeals conference 
we may choose to skip this option in favor of option file a petition for redetermination in tax court within days 
in this case  payments would not be required until the tax court renders its decision 
this option would still be available if option was chosen first and we were not satisfied with the result 
wait to receive a statement of amount due from the irs and pay the amount due 
pay the amount due as outlined in option above  except  after paying the amount due  take appropriate steps to institute a suit in federal district court or the federal claims court for a refund of the amounts paid 

table of contents the timing of any payments for any related state tax deficiencies will generally follow closely after the timing of any federal payments 
furthermore  at any point in time under any of the options outlined above  we can attempt to reach a settlement with the irs 
if we are unable to resolve this matter through the fast track mediation process  a decision would be made at that time as to which of the above options would be pursued 
in any case  we continue to believe that our position is well supported and will vigorously contest the proposed audit adjustment 
however  based on current circumstances  during the year ended december   we recorded a deferred tax asset and income taxes payable of million 
in addition  we recognized million of income tax expense associated with accrued interest on the proposed audit adjustment 
additionally  the irs proposed an adjustment to reduce the amount of a capital loss carryback claim related to the sale of ellis park during we have agreed to this adjustment 
as a result  approximately million of income tax expense related to the adjustment was recognized during the year ended december  and is included in discontinued operations 
as of december   total outstanding capital loss carryback claims to be received by us totaled million 
insurance recovery during  we discovered that an employee at calder  during the period from through  had committed theft by falsifying invoices for supplies that were not delivered and we filed an employee theft claim with our insurance carrier for million 
during the year ended december   we reached a settlement with our insurance carrier and received payment of million  which represents the full payment of claims related to the losses  net of a million deductible 
we recorded this recovery as a reduction to operating expenses during the year ended december  real estate tax refund during the year ended december   we received a payment of million from the state of illinois related to a successful challenge by arlington park that real estate tax payments made for the years through were excessive 
we recorded the real estate tax refund as a reduction to operating expenses during the year ended december   in addition to million of interest related to the real estate tax refund  which was recorded as interest income during the same period 
receipt of source market fees from august  through august   arlington park and ods technologies  lp d b a tvg were parties to an agreement whereby tvg telecasted and accepted advance deposit wagers on arlington park s races 
as part of the consideration for the rights under the agreement  tvg paid a source market fee to the national thoroughbred racing association ntra as a matter of practice 
the ntra held those source market fees on behalf of arlington park because of regulatory uncertainty concerning the receipt of source market fees in illinois 
on february   the ntra paid arlington park these previously withheld source market fees  which totaled million 
on february   we reached an agreement with the illinois thoroughbred horsemen s association stipulating that fifty percent of such source market fees will be paid as purses 
we recorded the source market fees as revenues  along with the related purse expense during the year ended december  hoosier park contingent consideration the partnership interest purchase agreement with centaur racing llc for the sale of our interest in hoosier park includes a contingent consideration provision whereby we are entitled to payments of million eighteen months following the date that slot machines are operational at hoosier park 
during june  hoosier park commenced its slot operations  fulfilling the terms of the contingency provision 
as of december   we 
table of contents have determined that collectability of amounts due is not reasonably assured  and therefore  we have not recognized the amount due under the agreement as of that date 
amounts due will be recorded as a gain on the sale of hoosier park once collectability is reasonably assured 
ohio legislation during its session  the ohio legislature included language in its budget bill that stated that the ohio lottery commission had existing authority to implement video lottery terminals at each of ohio s seven racetracks 
at the same time  the governor issued an executive order to the ohio lottery commission instructing it to promulgate rules for the implementation of video lottery terminals at ohio s racetracks 
subsequently  several lawsuits were filed i seeking a court ruling that the legislation was subject to ohio s voter referendum process or ii challenging the ohio legislature s authority to implement video lottery terminals 
the ohio supreme court subsequently ruled that the legislation is subject to ohio s voter referendum process and one group announced its intention to gather signatures to a petition to place the legislation on the ballot for a referendum 
the group submitted its petition in december of in addition  in november of  the voters of ohio approved a constitutional amendment to allow casinos in cincinnati  cleveland  columbus and toledo 
the timing for the development of the casinos is uncertain at this time 
the development of four land based casinos in ohio could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the governor of ohio is not actively pursuing the initiative  if video lottery terminals are implemented at ohio racetracks  we believe they would provide a competitive advantage to those racetracks and may enable ohio racetracks to increase their purses 
given the proximity of ohio to kentucky  the ohio racetracks may attract horses that would otherwise race at kentucky racetracks  including churchill downs  thus negatively affecting the number of starters and purse size 
we believe that fewer starters and lower purses  in turn  may have a negative effect on handle 
legislative and regulatory changes please refer to subheading j 
legislative changes in item business of this annual report on form k for information regarding legislative and regulatory changes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those initial estimates 
our most significant estimates relate to the valuation of property and equipment  receivables  goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be significantly affected by changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate  and to the aggregate costs for self insured liability and workers compensation claims 
additionally  estimates are used for determining income tax liabilities 
we review the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually during the first quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing whether goodwill is impaired  the fair value of the related reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit 
table of contents goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to such excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner  as when determining the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
we assign estimated useful lives to our definite lived intangible assets based on the period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
we consider certain factors when assigning useful lives such as legal  regulatory  competition and other economic factors 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight line method 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives and fair values 
changes in assumptions may cause modifications to our estimates for amortization or impairment  thereby impacting our results of operations 
if the estimated lives of our definite lived intangible assets were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  amortization expense could increase significantly 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  by economic conditions and by gaming competition 
a significant negative impact from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our property and equipment and or our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by competition and legislative changes is included in subsection i and subsection j  respectively  to item in this annual report on form k 
a business combinations accounting standard establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial impact of the business combination 
the accounting standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first reporting period for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and will have no impact on transactions recorded to date 
in connection with losses incurred from natural disasters  insurance proceeds are collected on existing business interruption and property and casualty insurance policies 
when losses are sustained in one period and the amounts to be recovered are collected in a subsequent period  management uses estimates and judgment to determine the amounts that are probable of recovery under such policies 
estimated losses  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  are recognized in the period the natural disaster occurs and the amount of the loss is determinable 
insurance recoveries in excess of estimated losses are recognized when realizable 
we also use estimates and judgments for financial reporting to determine our current tax liability  as well as those taxes deferred until future periods 
net deferred and accrued income taxes represent significant assets and liabilities of the company 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes  we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
adjustments to deferred taxes are determined based upon changes in differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by future tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates or the estimated level of taxable income or non deductible expenses could change the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and affect the overall effective tax rate and tax provision 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable that we have deemed to have a high risk of uncollectibility 
we analyze historical collection trends and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates could impact our bad debt expense and results of operations 

table of contents in  our business insurance renewals included substantially the same coverage and retentions as in previous years 
we estimate insurance liabilities for workers compensation and general liability losses based on our historical loss experience  certain actuarial assumptions of loss development factors and current industry trends 
any changes in our assumptions  actuarial assumptions or loss experience could impact our total insurance cost and overall results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
consolidated net revenues our net revenues and earnings are significantly influenced by our racing calendar 
therefore  revenues and operating results for any interim quarter are not generally indicative of the revenues and operating results for the year  and may not be comparable with results for the corresponding period of the previous year 
we historically have fewer live racing days during the first quarter of each year  with a majority of our live racing occurring in the second  third and fourth quarters  including the running of the kentucky derby and kentucky oaks in the second quarter 
information regarding racing dates at our facilities for and is included in subsection h to item  licenses and live race dates of this annual report on form k 
our pari mutuel revenues include commissions on pari mutuel wagering at our racetracks  otbs and adw providers net of state pari mutuel taxes  plus simulcast host fees from other wagering sites and source market fees generated from contracts with adw providers 
in addition to the commissions earned on pari mutuel wagering  we earn pari mutuel related streams of revenues from sources that are not related to wagering 
these other pari mutuel related revenues are primarily derived from statutory racing regulations in some of the states where our facilities are located and can fluctuate materially year to year 
gaming revenues are primarily generated from video poker and slot machines 
other operating revenues are primarily generated from admissions  sponsorships  licensing rights and broadcast fees  fees for alternative uses of our facilities  concessions  lease income  information sales and other sources

gaming revenues represent net gaming wins  which is the difference between gaming wins and losses  net of related gaming taxes 
other operating revenues such as admissions  programs and concession revenues are recognized as delivery of the product or services has occurred 
approximately of our annual revenues are generated by pari mutuel wagering on live and simulcast racing content through otbs and adw providers

the gross percentages retained on live racing and import simulcasting at our various locations range from approximately to 
in general  the fees earned from export simulcasting including adw wagering are contractually determined and average approximately certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of performance of the gaming segment 
our slot facilities and video poker operations report gross win per unit which is calculated as gross gaming revenues  before taxes and promotional deductions  per machine and per day of operations 
finally  we report an actual hold percentage  which reflects our gaming revenues as a percentage of the total amount wagered by customers

purse expense also increased million at churchill downs as a result of lower pari mutuel taxes incurred during compared to such an increase was a result of the fact that churchill downs incurred a one time reduction in pari mutuel taxes of million during the year ended december  due to not achieving average daily handle levels that trigger the payment of pari mutuel taxes at the maximum rate of  as has

purse expenses decreased in conjunction with lower pari mutuel revenues experienced at calder and churchill downs as a result of the refusal by certain horsemen s groups to grant consents to export and import racing signals for wagering purposes
