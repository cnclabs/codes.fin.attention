our pooled companies and sa national are rated a superior by the am best company 
state auto financial s principal subsidiaries are state auto p c  milbank  farmers  sa ohio and sa national  each of which is a property and casualty insurance company  and stateco  which provides investment management services to affiliated insurance companies 
our reportable segments are personal insurance  business insurance collectively the insurance segments or our insurance segments and investment operations 
these segments reflect the manner in which we manage our business and report our results internally to our principal operating decision makers 
the personal insurance segment provides primarily personal auto standard and nonstandard and homeowners to the personal insurance market 
the business insurance segment provides primarily commercial auto  commercial multi peril  fire allied lines  other product liability and workers compensation insurance to small to medium sized businesses within the commercial insurance market 
the investment operations segment  managed by stateco  provides investment services for our invested assets 
we evaluate the performance of our insurance segments using industry financial measurements determined based on statutory accounting principles sap  and certain measures determined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we evaluate our investment operations segment based on investment returns of assets managed 
financial information about our segments is set forth in this item and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
rockhill insurance group in february  state auto mutual completed its acquisition of the rockhill insurance group 
the insurers in the rockhill insurance group write specialty property and casualty insurance  with key product lines that include commercial property  general liability for residential construction  commercial umbrella  surety  program  professional and environmental 
in addition  its subsidiary red acts as a managing general underwriter for a variety of property and casualty coverages in the alternative risk transfer market 
in  the state auto group will write new commercial specialty business through red  which will allow the state auto group to offer insurance coverages for the alternative risk transfer market for business products such as general liability  auto liability  workers compensation  property  inland marine  auto physical damage and miscellaneous professional 
the insurance coverages written by our pooled companies through red are subject to the pooling arrangement 

table of contents executive summary the results of our operations from year to year and quarter to quarter are primarily driven by our ability to generate revenue through selecting and pricing risks in a manner that permits premium growth without adversely affecting underwriting profits and disciplined investment strategy 
we also recognize that our results will be periodically impacted  sometimes significantly  by the occurrence of catastrophic events 
premium growth underwriting profitability the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical 
our industry has been historically characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity  as well as periods of shortages of underwriting capacity that result in increased prices and more favorable underwriting terms 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  some property and casualty insurers attempt to generate additional top line growth by setting their prices at levels inappropriate for the risk underwritten 
while in the short term this may result in additional revenues  this action compromises their long term underwriting profitability 
our strategy is to insure personal and small to medium business risks while adhering to disciplined and consistent underwriting principles through all market cycles 
in the current cycle  it appears that business exposures are contracting due to reduced payrolls and inventories  resulting in price pressure 
for personal lines  it appears that rising claim costs are resulting in opportunities to establish more favorable underwriting terms 
we have been monitoring this situation for each of our lines of business and have responded in ways consistent with our goals not to compromise underwriting profitability and to protect the interests of our stakeholders 
our underwriting principles include insistence on selecting and retaining business based on the merits of each account and a dedication to cost based pricing  where each line of business is priced to generate a profit 
it is our intention to set pricing levels so that no line of business  or classification within major lines  subsidizes another line or classification 
we are committed to achieving an underwriting profit through all market cycles  even at the expense of periodic slowdowns in written and earned premiums 
we will not compromise underwriting profitability for top line growth 
we believe that we can implement periodic rate changes in most states and remain an attractive market to our policyholders and independent agents by stressing the strengths we bring to the marketplace 
these strengths include stability  financial soundness  prompt and fair claims service  and technology which make it easier for the agent to do business with the state auto group and provide substantial value to our customers 
we carefully monitor writing insurance in states that we believe present difficult legislative  judicial and or regulatory environments for the insurance industry 
investment strategy we have a disciplined approach to our investment strategy that emphasizes the quality of our fixed maturity portfolio  which comprised of our total portfolio at fair value at december   and includes primarily investment grade securities 
the majority of our fixed maturity portfolio is invested in municipal bonds to recognize the tax advantages available from municipal bond income 
in addition  we believe that our credit risk exposure is reduced by investing in high quality municipal bonds that are diversified by issuer and state 
we regularly monitor the duration of our fixed maturity portfolio 
in our monitoring process we take into account market expectations regarding future interest rates and inflation 
our internally managed equity portfolio  which comprised of our total portfolio at fair value at december   emphasizes large cap  dividend paying companies selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
since  we have diversified our equity portfolio and utilized outside managers to invest in us small cap equities and international equity funds 
diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international equity funds was designed to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
in  almost all asset classes experienced a decline in fair value  and our portfolio was not immune to this broad based decline 
during  as the stock market recovered above its level  the fair value of our equity portfolio improved 
we believe that in most market cycles diversification of our portfolio will be beneficial to us and we plan to continue to maintain a diversified portfolio 

table of contents loss reserves we maintain reserves for the eventual payment of losses and loss expenses for both reported claims and incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
loss reserves are management s best estimate at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all claims incurred as of the end of the accounting period  based on facts  circumstances and historical trends then known 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
we do not discount loss reserves for financial statement purposes 
our objective is to set reserves that are adequate such that the amounts originally recorded as reserves reasonably approximate the ultimate liability for insured losses and loss expenses 
we regularly review and adjust loss reserves as appropriate 
catastrophic events we are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophic events 
catastrophe losses can and do cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  hailstorms  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and fires  none of which are within our control 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the magnitude of loss from a catastrophe is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposure in the affected area 
catastrophes  to which we are exposed  including hurricanes  earthquakes and other perils  may be severe and produce significant loss 
we are also exposed to significant loss from less severe catastrophes when they affect large geographic areas or areas that are heavily populated 
although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines  most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners  allied lines and commercial multiple peril coverages 
we deploy specific strategies designed to mitigate our exposure to catastrophe losses  which include obtaining reinsurance and applying mandatory specific peril deductibles for some states 
we continually seek to diversify our business on a geographic basis 
the number of states we actively operate in has increased from states in to states and the district of columbia as of december  as we begin  the concentration of our direct written premiums for our property and casualty operations in our largest five states has decreased from for the year ended december   to approximately at december  our management strategies are designed to mitigate our exposure to catastrophes 
in addition to adherence to our cost based pricing  investment and catastrophe risk mitigation strategies discussed above  our management focuses on several other key areas with the intention of continually improving the results of our operations and financial results  including the following claims service we believe an important element of our success is our focus on claims service 
we expect our claim service to be fair  fast and friendly 
the role of the claims division is to deliver the promise that we and the independent agent made to the insured 
we have the capability of receiving claims hours a day  seven days a week 
claims may be reported to our claims contact center  to the policyholder s independent agent or via the internet at www 
stateauto 
com 
we make a pledge to our policyholders to contact them within two hours of a claim being assigned to a claims handler except in catastrophe loss situations 
to enhance our response to policyholders in catastrophe loss situations  we establish internal claims catastrophe teams 
independent insurance agent network we believe the success of our independent insurance agent network  which is our primary distribution channel  grows out of our commitment to promote and foster close working relationships with our agents 
we seek relationships with agencies where we will be one of their top three insurers  measured on the basis of direct premiums written  for the type of business we desire 
our agents compensation package includes competitive commission rates and other sales inducements designed to maintain and enhance relationships with existing independent agents as well as to attract new independent agents 
we provide our agents with a co operative advertising program  sales training programs  contingent commissions  travel incentives and agency recognition 
we continually monitor our agencies for compatibility with us  taking into account factors such as loss ratio  premium volume  business profiles and relationship history 
this allows us to be proactive in helping our agents grow their book of business with us profitably and  thus  enhance the 
table of contents long term value of our relationship 
our senior management meets frequently with agents to encourage mutual growth and demonstrate our commitment 
we believe each of these elements creates a relationship that has resulted in our independent insurance agents placing quality insurance business with us 
technology our technology efforts are focused on making us as efficient and effective as possible 
during  we continued our personal lines strategy of integrating external data directly into our netxpress sm portal by significantly expanding the portfolio of third parties with whom we can extract data 
we also have taken advantage of industry wide data standards and commonly used agent systems to provide enhanced functionality to our agents  who have rewarded us with increased quote opportunities and submissions 
we also completed the production of a new homeowners product which will be rolled out state by state in and in  our business insurance segment technology teams delivered a more sophisticated businessowners product to the marketplace 
this new product will be rolled out to the majority of our states in we also made further developments in our predictive modeling technology and integrated these into our standard business flows so that we can use this new functionality when underwriting the majority of our new and renewal business 
project management and quality assurance efforts continue to mature and provide value 
investments in enterprise architecture were also made to aid information technology governance and to support our ability to reach efficiency goals set by us 
construction of a new data center by state auto mutual was completed in december this state of the art facility provides the state auto group a reliable infrastructure designed to scale with the future business requirements of our company 
migration of computing activities to this facility will commence in innovate sa in  we launched a formal company wide plan called innovate sa  which is intended to reduce expenses  enhance revenues and improve margins 
innovate sa is comprised of various initiatives  including changes to our field structure  business processes and product changes 
innovate sa began with an idea generation phase that involved our associates and was followed by an evaluation phase that was led by senior managers in our business units 
the idea generation and evaluation phases were completed for the most part in the fourth quarter of  and separate actions were approved for implementation 
the implementation of these actions began in and is expected to continue through critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in this item we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 
investments our fixed maturity  equity security and certain other invested asset investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 

table of contents we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary impaired otti  an assessment that requires significant management judgment regarding the evidence known 
such judgments could change in the future as more information becomes known which could negatively impact the amounts reported herein 
we consider the following factors when assessing our equity securities and other invested assets for otti the length of time and or the significance of decline below cost  our ability and intent to hold these securities through their recovery periods  the current financial condition of the issuer and its future business prospects  and the ability of the market value to recover to cost in the near term 
we recognize otti charges on our externally managed small cap equity portfolio and a segment of our large cap portfolio  as we are unable to make the assertion regarding our intent to hold these securities that are currently valued below cost until recovery in the near term 
when an equity security or other invested asset has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not reversed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we also consider the following factors when assessing our fixed maturities investments for otti the financial condition of the issuer including receipt of scheduled principal and interest cash flows  our intent to sell  and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery 
when a fixed maturity has been determined to have an other than temporary impairment  the impairment charge is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings as a realized loss  and the amount related to non credit factors  which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses relating to the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized over the same period in which the related premiums are earned 
the method followed for computing the acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premium to be earned  losses and loss expenses expected to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected losses and loss adjustment expenses  that indicate a reduction in expected future profitability may result in unrecoverable deferred policy acquisition costs 
we have not recorded any significant changes in estimates for the years ended december   and  respectively 
losses and loss expenses payable our loss and loss expense payables are reserves which reflect all unpaid amounts for claims that have been reported  as well as for claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr 
our loss and loss expense reserves are not discounted to present value 
losses and allocated loss expense reserves loss and alae reserve are management s best estimates mbe at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all claims incurred as of that date based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and applicable policy provisions 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
the process for calculating the ibnr component of the loss and 
table of contents alae reserve is to develop an estimate of the ultimate losses and allocated loss expenses incurred  and subtract all amounts already paid or held as case or formula reserves 
the ultimate determination of mbe integrates information and analysis provided by several disciplines within our company  including claims  actuarial and accounting 
this assessment requires considerable judgment in understanding how claims mature  which lines of business are the most volatile  and how trends change over time 
loss and alae reserves represent an estimate at a given point in time based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates and economic conditions 
although we consider many different sources of information  as well as a number of actuarial methodologies to estimate our loss and alae reserve  there is no single method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
our internal actuarial staff conducts quarterly reviews of projected loss development information to assist management in making estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness tests are performed on many of the assumptions underlying each reserving methodology  such as claim frequency  claim severity and loss ratios 
nonetheless  changes which are not contemplated do occur over time  and those changes are incorporated in subsequent valuations of the loss reserves 
we use a number of different methodologies to estimate the ibnr component of the loss and alae reserves 
our reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail lines of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
in general  the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
the reserving methods and strengths and weaknesses of each are described below 
short tail business for short tail business  claims are typically settled within five years  and the most common actuarial estimates are based on techniques using link ratio projections of incurred losses  paid losses  claim counts and claim severities 
each of these methods is described below in detail 
separate projections are made for catastrophes that are in the very early stages of development based on specific information known through the reporting date 
incurred loss development method the incurred loss development method is probably the most common actuarial method used in projecting indicated ibnr reserves 
this method uses paid loss experience as well as the outstanding estimates formula and case reserves for claims that have been reported and are still open 
the underlying assumption of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy remains consistent over time 
this method s advantage is its responsiveness to changes in reported losses  which is particularly valuable in the less mature accident years 
the disadvantage of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy changes will distort the ibnr projections 
paid loss development method the paid loss development method uses calculations that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
the key difference is that the data used in the paid method exclude case reserve estimates  so only paid losses are utilized 
with this method  a payment pattern is estimated to project ultimate settlement values for each accident year  with the underlying assumption that claims are settled at a consistent rate over time 
neither case reserves nor the rate at which claims are reported except to the extent that the reporting pattern influences the payment pattern is relevant to the results of this method 
this method s advantage is the estimates of ultimate loss are independent of case reserve adequacy and are unaffected by company changes in case reserving philosophy 
the disadvantages are that the paid method does not use all of the available information  and in some cases the liability payment patterns require the application of very large development factors to relatively small payments in less mature accident years 

table of contents claim counts and severities method the counts and severities method calculations are very similar to the other methods 
the incurred claim counts reported to date are projected to an ultimate number 
similarly  the incurred loss severities are projected to an ultimate value 
the ultimate incurred count is multiplied by the ultimate incurred severity  for each accident year  to arrive at the ultimate incurred loss 
finally  as with the other loss development methods  an estimate of the ibnr reserve is calculated by subtracting the reported losses from the estimated ultimate losses 
long tail business reserve estimates for long tail business use the same methods listed above along with several other methods as determined by the actuary 
for example  premium based methods may be used in developing ultimate loss estimates  including the expected loss ratio  bornhuetter ferguson  and least squares techniques as described below 
we also use statistical models when the historical patterns can be reasonably approximated 
expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method generates indicated ibnr by multiplying an expected loss ratio by earned premium  then subtracting incurred to date losses 
for slower reporting lines of business  new products  or data that is very immature  the actual claim data is often too limited or too volatile for other projection methods 
with this method the premiums are used as a measure of loss exposure  and the loss ratios can be derived from pricing expectations 
bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method is a weighted average of the expected loss ratio method and the incurred loss development method  using the percentage of losses reported as the weight 
this method is particularly useful where there is a low volume of data in the current accident period  or where the experience is volatile 
in general  this method produces estimates that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
least square loss development method in the least squares loss development method the statistical technique of least squares regression is applied to a triangle of reported loss ratios to project the ultimate loss ratio in each accident year 
using historical loss ratios puts the data for each time period on a more consistent exposure basis  because premium levels are generally correlated with insured exposures 
a by product of the regression function is an estimate of credibility for each stage of development 
in cases where the regression parameters fall outside of a reasonable range  the projection defaults to the incurred loss method 
selection process in determining which reserving method to use for a particular line of business or accident year  diagnostic tests of loss ratios and severity trends are considered  as well as the historic case reserve adequacy and claim settlement rate 
in general  the incurred loss development method is used if the projections are stable  the data is credible  historic case reserve adequacy is consistent  and the loss ratios and loss severities are reasonable 
other reserving methods are considered as well for particular lines of business or accident years  along with supplemental information such as open claim counts and prior period development 
for example  if more than one method provides a reasonable projection  the actuary may select an average of those methods 
there is considerable judgment applied in the analysis of the historical patterns and in applying business knowledge of our underwriting and claims functions 
reserve ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the reserve projections 
the primary determinant in estimating the reserve range boundaries are the variances measured within the historical reserving data for the various lines of business 
mbe of loss reserves considers the expected variation to establish an appropriate position within a range 
mbe loss and alae reserves for sa national and the stfc pooled companies share of the pooled companies reserves at december   was million  within an estimated range of million to million 
these values presented are on a direct basis  gross of salvage and subrogation recoverable  and before reinsurance  except for the stfc pooled companies participation in the inter company pooling arrangement 
therefore  these values cannot be compared to other loss and loss expenses payable tables included elsewhere within this form k 

table of contents the potential impact of the reserve variability on net income can be illustrated using the range end points and carried reserve amounts listed above 
for example  if ultimate losses reach a level corresponding to the high point of the range  million  the reserve increase of million corresponds to an after tax decrease of million in net income 
likewise  should ultimate losses decline to a level corresponding to the low point of the range  million  the million reserve decrease would add million of after tax net income 
the reserve range noted above represents a range of reasonably likely reserves  not a range of all possible reserves 
therefore  the ultimate losses could reach levels corresponding to reserve amounts outside the range provided 
an important assumption underlying the reserve estimation methods for the major casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and alae patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of reserves to an unexpected change in inflation  projected calendar year payment patterns were applied to the december   other product liability loss and alae reserve to generate estimated annual incremental loss and alae payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for purposes of sensitivity testing  an additional annual loss cost trend of was added to the trend implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and alae payments were calculated 
this type of inflationary increase could arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional  unexpected increase in the loss cost trend would have on our results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims in other product liability is an increase of million on reserves  or a million reduction to net income  assuming a tax rate of 
inflation changes have much more impact on the longer tail commercial lines like other product liability and workers compensation  and much less impact on the shorter tail personal lines reserves 
in addition to establishing loss and alae reserves  as described above  we establish reserves for loss adjustment expenses related to functions and costs that are not attributable to a specific claim  which is called unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae 
historical patterns of paid ulae relative to paid loss are analyzed along with historical claim counts including claims opened  claims closed  and claims remaining open 
the product of this analysis is an estimate of the relationship  or ratio  between ulae and loss underlying the current loss reserves 
this ratio is applied to the current outstanding loss reserves to estimate the required ulae reserve 
consequently  this component of the loss expense reserve has a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held loss reserves 
the method assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change materially over time 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of mbe of our direct loss and alae reserve to our net loss and loss expenses payable at december  and  respectively

asbestos reserves are million  and environmental reserves are million  for a total of million  or of net losses and loss expenses payable 
asbestos reserves decreased million and environmental reserves increased million from because we have insured primarily product retailers and distributors  we do not expect to incur the same level of liability  particularly related to asbestos  as companies that have insured manufacturing risks 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the loss and loss expense reserve estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience being different from historical data and trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations pension and postretirement benefit obligations are long term in nature and require management s judgment in estimating the factors used to determine these amounts 
we review these factors annually  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because these obligations are based on estimates which could change  the ultimate benefit obligation could be different from the amount estimated 

table of contents the state auto group has a defined benefit pension plan and a postretirement health care plan covering substantially all employees collectively the benefit plans 
several factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining benefit obligations may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
to calculate the state auto group s december  benefit obligation for each of the benefit plans  we used a discount rate of based on an evaluation of the expected future benefit cash flows of our benefit plans used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate results in  all else being equal  a higher present value of the benefit obligation 
to calculate our benefit obligation at december  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december   a discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used 
we selected an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by considering the mix of investments and stability of investment portfolio along with actual investment experience during the lifetime of the plans 
our assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets could have an effect on the amounts related to our benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost depending on the degree of change between reporting periods 
the table below provides an illustration of variability with respect to the discount rate on our december   benefit obligation and expected net periodic benefit cost  along with the variability of the expected return on plan assets to our expected net periodic benefit cost 
holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in any one of our key assumptions are as follows millions pension postretirement discount rate discount rate benefit obligation net periodic benefit cost expected return on plan assets expected return on plan assets net periodic benefit cost the accumulated benefit obligation abo of a defined benefit pension plan represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to the measurement date and based on current and past compensation levels  while the projected benefit obligation pbo is the abo plus a factor for future compensation levels 
the abo  which considers current compensations level only  provides information about the obligation an employer would have if the plan were discontinued at the measurement date 
at december   the abo and pbo were million and million  respectively 
at december  the fair value of the assets of our defined benefit pension plan was million  which resulted in an underfunded status within our balance sheet of million 
on a cash flow basis  we target an annual contribution level that meets at least the targeted normal cost of the plan  as defined by erisa 
currently  we expect to make a cash contribution to the pension plan up to million in our unfunded status on our pension plan decreased from million at december   to million at december  the factors influencing this decrease are as follows actual return on our plan 
table of contents assets was a gain of million compared to an expected return of million for a net decrease to our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss of approximately million  and our field and claim restructuring in discussed below resulted in a plan curtailment gain which reduced our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss by approximately million 
unrecognized gains and losses arise from additional factors including expected to actual demographic changes  such as retirement age  mortality  turnover  and rate of compensation increases 
the cumulative unrecognized actuarial loss is systematically recognized as an increase in net periodic cost over the average future service period of active participants 
our unfunded status on our postretirement medical plan retiree med plan decreased from million at december  to million at december  the factors influencing this decrease are as follows a million curtailment gain due to our field and claim restructuring which reduced our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss  and additional unrecognized net actuarial gains and loss adjustments arising from demographic changes and expected to actual claims experience  which at december  had the effect of decreasing our obligation and unrecognized actuarial loss 
see compared to acquisition and operating expenses included in this item for a discussion regarding the field and claim restructuring and note  pension and postretirement benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further disclosures regarding our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
in november  we announced to our employees a one time election to select between two retirement benefit options to either continue participation in the existing pension plan with no changes  or to choose a new enhanced k in which we will contribute of the employee s annual income to his her k automatically 
under the enhanced k option  the employee s existing accrued pension benefit would become frozen as of june  employees hired on  or after january   will not be eligible to participate in the pension or postretirement health care benefit plans 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effect of the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically by management to determine if they are realizable  requiring us to make certain judgments and assumptions 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence  including loss carryback potential  past operating results  existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  projected performance of the business  future taxable income  including the ability to generate capital gains  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if  based on available information  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized  then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income and or accumulated comprehensive income 
no valuation allowance was held by us at december  other other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in item a of this form k under risk factors 
actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
pooling arrangement the stfc pooled companies and the mutual pooled companies  referred to as the pooled companies  participate in a quota share reinsurance pooling arrangement referred to as the pooling arrangement 
under the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual assumes premiums  losses and expenses from each of the remaining pooled companies and in turn cedes to each of the pooled companies a specified portion of premiums  losses 
table of contents and expenses based on each of the pooled companies respective pooling percentages 
state auto mutual then retains the balance of the pooled business 
the participation percentage for the stfc pooled companies has remained at since prior to  the pooling arrangement covered all property and casualty insurance written by the pooled companies except state auto mutual s voluntary assumed reinsurance  middle market business insurance written by state auto mutual and meridian security and intercompany catastrophe reinsurance written by state auto p c 
in  we made the following changes to the pooling arrangement the pooling changes added beacon national to the pool with a participation percentage of added patrons mutual and litchfield to the pool with participation percentages of and  respectively  reduced state auto mutual s participation percentage from to to accommodate the participation percentages allocated to patrons mutual and litchfield  included state auto middle market business insurance written by state auto mutual and meridian security  and included voluntary assumed reinsurance from parties affiliated with state auto mutual 
in  we made the following changes to the pooling arrangement the pooling changes added sa national to the pool with a participation percentage of  and included voluntary assumed reinsurance from third parties unaffiliated with the pooled companies that was assumed on or after january  by state auto mutual 
in conjunction with the pooling changes  the stfc pooled companies will receive approximately million in cash and or investment securities from state auto mutual and its subsidiaries and affiliates  for net insurance assets transferred on january  the following table presents the impact on our balance sheet on january   relating to the pooling changes millions losses and loss expenses payable unearned premiums less deferred policy acquisition costs other assets net cash and or investment securities to be received

under applicable governance procedures  if the pooling arrangement were to be amended  management would make recommendations to the independent committees of the board of directors of both state auto mutual and stfc 
the independent committees review and evaluate such factors as they deem relevant and recommend any appropriate pooling change to the board of directors of both state auto mutual and stfc 
the pooling arrangement is terminable by any of our pooled companies at any time by any party by giving twelve months notice to the other parties and their respective domiciliary insurance departments 
none of our pooled companies currently intends to terminate the pooling arrangement 
under the terms of the pooling arrangement  all subject premiums  incurred losses  loss expenses and other underwriting expenses are prorated among our pooled companies on the basis of their participation in the pool 
by spreading the underwriting risk the pooling arrangement is designed to produce more uniform and stable underwriting results for each of our pooled companies than any one company would experience individually 
this has the effect of providing each of our pooled companies with a similar mix of pooled property and casualty insurance business on a net basis 
prior to july   the pooling arrangement excluded catastrophic losses and loss adjustment expenses that were reinsured under our catastrophe assumption agreement defined below  as well as the premium for such exposures 
state auto p c reinsured each insurer in the state auto group for this layer of reinsurance in the amount of million in excess of million 
no losses were paid by state auto p c under the catastrophe assumption agreement in or the state auto group did not renew the catastrophe assumption agreement upon its expiration on july  
table of contents results of operations summary the following table summarizes certain key performance indicators used to manage our operations for the years ended december   and  respectively millions  except per share data gaap basis total revenues net income loss stockholders equity book value per share return on average equity debt to capital ratio loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio catastrophe loss and lae points premium written growth premium earned growth investment yield sap basis loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio net premiums written to surplus see compared to section below for definitions 
net income loss divided by average common stockholders equity 
points of the increase for is related to the one time million transfer of unearned premium to us on january   in conjunction with the pooling changes 
the sap loss and lae ratio is losses and loss expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums 
the sap expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses and miscellaneous expenses offset by miscellaneous income underwriting expenses as a percentage of net written premiums 
the sap combined ratio is the sum of the sap loss and lae ratio and the sap expense ratio 
we use the statutory net premiums written to surplus ratio because there is no comparable gaap measure 
this ratio  also called the leverage ratio  measures our statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
compared to for  we reported a pre tax loss of million compared to a pre tax loss of million for revenues increased to  million in from  million in while expenses increased to  million in from  million in the following are significant factors that impacted results compared to earned premiums in were  million compared to  million in this growth was driven by personal lines

see the loss and lae section included in this item our non catastrophe losses for were million  or loss ratio points  compared to million  or loss ratio points  for the same period 
several lines of business contributed to this increase 
see the loss and lae section included in this item insurance segments insurance industry regulators require our insurance subsidiaries to report their financial condition and results of operations using sap 
we use sap financial results  along with industry standard financial measures determined on a sap basis and certain measures determined on a gaap basis  to internally monitor the performance of our insurance segments and reward our employees 
the more common financial measures used are loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio  combined ratio  net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
when the combined ratio is less than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting gain and when it is greater than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting loss 
underwriting gain loss is determined by subtracting from net earned premiums  losses and loss expenses and underwriting expenses 
one of the more significant differences between gaap and sap is that sap requires all underwriting expenses to be expensed immediately and not deferred over the same period that the premium is earned 
in converting sap underwriting results to gaap underwriting results  acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the periods the related written premiums are earned 
for a discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs  see critical accounting policies deferred acquisition costs section included in this item the gaap combined ratio is defined as the sum of the gaap loss and lae ratio loss and loss expenses as a percentage of earned premiums plus gaap expense ratio acquisition and operating expenses as a percentage of earned premiums 
charges related to the restructuring of our field and claims operations  as well as those recorded due to the north carolina beach plan write off  contributed to the difference between our gaap expense ratio and our sap expense ratio 
the restructuring differences relate mainly to the timing of the recognition of employee termination benefits 
sap requires us to estimate and immediately recognize the entire estimated costs related to severance  while gaap requires similar estimated costs to be recognized ratably over the remaining service period of the employees impacted 
the write off related to the north carolina beach plan was included in the other expense line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  and was therefore not included in the computation of the gaap expense ratio

revenue we measure our top line growth for our insurance segments based on net written premiums  which represent the premiums on the policies we have issued for a period  net of reinsurance 
net written premiums provide us with an indication of how well we are doing in terms of revenue growth before it is actually earned 
our policies provide a fixed amount of coverage for a stated period of time  often referred to as the policy term 
as such  our written premiums are recognized as earned ratably over the policy term 
the unearned portion of written premiums  called unearned premiums  is reflected on our balance sheet as a liability and represents our obligation to provide coverage for the unexpired terms of the policy

our strategy to grow our personal lines business includes introducing new products  enhanced systems and easier to use technologies into all states 
since  we have introduced personal lines products into four new states 
during  we continued to enhance our personal lines point of sale portal  netxpress 
the additional integration with the systems commonly used by our independent agents has resulted in an increase in the number of quotes for personal auto and homeowners 
in  the state auto group received over million personal lines quotes through comparative raters  bridging solutions and our own proprietary rating system 
this compares favorably to less than million quotes received in 
table of contents the following table provides a summary of written and earned premium  net of reinsurance  by major product line of business for our personal insurance segment for the years ended december  and the one time impact of the pooling changes has been excluded from to present net written premiums on a comparative basis see net written premium reconciliation table above millions change personal insurance segment net written premium standard auto nonstandard auto homeowners other personal total personal net earned premium standard auto nonstandard auto homeowners other personal total personal standard personal auto net written premiums for the year ended december  increased from the state auto group s expansion of its operations within four of our newer states  texas  colorado  arizona and connecticut  has contributed approximately to our premium growth in standard personal auto 
recent rate increases have also contributed to premium growth in we believe our new products and advanced technology have strengthened our position with our independent agencies and make us attractive to prospective policyholders looking for greater value in their insurance products 
our auto product  customfit sm  coupled with easier quote capabilities  has resulted in a significant increase in new business quotes in while the number of new business quotes is higher  our issue to quote ratio has remained relatively consistent with prior years 
we believe independent agents value ease of doing business and make it an important factor in their choice of insurance companies when quoting personal auto products to their customers 
in early  we began implementing comparative rating tools which allow agents to receive rate quotes from multiple insurance companies by entering the rating information only one time 
to date  we have implemented over different integration points to our personal lines rating engine thus eliminating duplicate entry for agents 
we believe agents will quote and write more personal standard and nonstandard auto and homeowners insurance with us as a result of a more efficient quoting process combined with more competitive rates resulting from our new auto product  customfit  for standard auto and refined pricing for nonstandard auto 
nonstandard auto net written premium for the year ended december   decreased from in  we began increasing rates and tightening underwriting controls  and in  we continued increasing rates and began terminating certain agencies that failed to consistently perform to our expectations 
these actions coupled with the impact of general economic conditions have resulted in a reduction of nonstandard new business 
homeowners net written premiums for the year ended december   increased from approximately one third of this premium growth was from rate increases  one third was due to the expansion of new business in texas  colorado  arizona and connecticut  and the remaining one third was due to expansion in our other states 
we continue to aggressively address our rate needs in this line of business  and we are seeking higher rates in 
table of contents business insurance segment revenue we focus our business insurance sales on small to medium sized exposures and offer a broad range of both property and liability coverages 
the following table provides a summary of written and earned premium  net of reinsurance  by major product line of business for our business insurance segment for the years ended december  and the one time impact of the pooling changes has been excluded from to present net written premiums on a comparative basis see net written premiums reconciliation table above millions change business insurance segment net written premium commercial auto commercial multi peril fire allied lines other product liability workers compensation other commercial total business net earned premium commercial auto commercial multi peril fire allied lines other product liability workers compensation other commercial total business the business insurance segment net written premium decreased for the year ended december   from business insurance continues to be impacted by rate competition and general economic conditions  as well as ease of doing business issues 
despite these factors  we strengthened our premium per exposure in the second half of by re evaluating and adjusting the application of debits and credits on our renewal policies 
we believe it will be difficult to generate measurable growth given the impact of the economy on premium bases such as payrolls  sales and number of vehicles 
however  we are seeking to balance our traditional underwriting discipline with new products and pricing tools that support the production of profitable new business 
we continue to invest in products  processes and systems that we believe will increase our business insurance writings 
for our property and liability business  we have implemented a pricing process that we believe will help us price risks at appropriate levels and improve account retention  we are pursuing the same for our commercial auto and workers compensation lines of business 
in addition  we have broadened our property  liability  auto and workers compensation pricing ranges to improve our ability to recognize the spectrum of risks within our markets 
we continue to enhance our insurance policy administration system to make it easier for our agents to quote and submit business insurance policies to us 
our system now allows transactions to be processed throughout the day using real time and straight through processing rather than in large batch cycles at night 
we have leveraged this functionality with bizxpress sm  our web based quote system  to give agents the ability to quote businessowners and commercial auto risks on line 

table of contents we are working to expand the scope of bizxpress to add new products and lines of business  including workers compensation 
we believe this technology investment should better position us for revenue growth opportunities in the future and start to drive efficiencies into our business model much like we have seen in personal insurance 
the majority of all transactions in business insurance utilize the straight through processing technology 
this has resulted in faster delivery of policies to our agents and their insureds for new business and endorsements 
we are also expanding the eligibility of our businessowners product to facilitate businesses with greater liability exposures  such as artisan contractors  auto service garages  manufacturers and restaurants 
while we regularly insure these types of businesses through other insurance products  offering them in our businessowners program leverages our bizxpress technology  simplifies agents rating and submission processes  and offers broader base coverages for these types of risks 
in late  we implemented our enhanced businessowners product in utah and plan to introduce this product enhancement to other states within the first six months of similar to our personal lines segment  we are expanding our product offerings in our newer states of operations 
we are leveraging our relationship with the agency distribution channel as a result of state auto mutual s affiliation with the patrons insurance group 
we introduced our commercial package  auto and workers compensation products in connecticut in the first quarter of in the second quarter  we made these products available for risks with district of columbia and delaware locations 
loss and lae our gaap loss and lae ratio was in compared to in the decrease in the gaap loss and lae ratio was due to a reduction in catastrophe storm losses offset partially by an increase in non catastrophe losses

a tabular presentation of the favorable development in by accident year is shown below

ulae are those expenses or costs incurred in settling claims  such as in house processing costs  which cannot be associated with a specific claim

this development occurred primarily within our homeowners  fire allied and commercial multi peril lines of business 
non catastrophe reserves for the auto liability lines and other product liability developed lower than anticipated 
standard  nonstandard and commercial auto liability reserves developed million lower and other product liability developed million lower than anticipated 
this favorable development  which was primarily associated with the accident year  was driven by lower than anticipated tabular loss severity  as well as lower than anticipated loss frequency for other product liability

during  we were impacted by losses from of the storms that were classified as numbered catastrophes by pcs as compared to of the pcs classified storms in  one of which was hurricane ike 
the losses from these catastrophes have had a significant impact on both our personal and business insurance property lines

previously  the intense price competition in the personal lines market had impeded our ability to take appropriate rate increases 
however  we believe price competition in the personal lines market is becoming less intense  which has allowed us to recently implement rate increases  contributing some to our growth 
we intend to continue to seek price increases in the mid single digit range in the increase in the non cat homeowners loss ratio was due primarily to experiencing more large fire losses and settling one threatened class action claim 
settlement of the one class action claim increased the non cat homeowners loss ratio by points 
we continue to seek homeowners rate increases in various states as appropriate for that state 
however  there is no assurance that the regulatory authorities will grant our requested rate increases 
in addition to pricing actions and the aggregate treaty implemented earlier this year  we have implemented mandatory wind and hail deductibles in approximately one third of our operating states and are in the process of strengthening our insurance to value program 
in addition  we introduced our new homeowner by peril rated product in the fourth quarter of and we will continue state by state deployment of this product throughout and in total  the business insurance segment s non cat loss ratio for was comparable to however  commercial auto and commercial multi peril loss ratios decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number and size of large losses when compared to the increase in the fire allied lines loss ratio was the result of more large fires in the increase in other product liability was due primarily to an increase in the estimate of internal claim handling expenses 
intense competition in the business insurance segment continues to impact our ability to implement price increases where needed

we conduct quarterly reviews of loss development reports and make judgments in determining the reserves for ultimate losses and loss expenses payable 
several factors are considered by us when estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure changes  anticipated inflation  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  late reported claims  and other reasonableness tests 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in our estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience different from historical data  trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
acquisition and operating expenses our gaap expense ratio was in compared to in the decrease in the expense ratio can be attributed principally to expenses being applied to a larger premium base in as compared to  and the inclusion of costs associated with launching our isa initiative in as a result of innovate sa  in the second quarter of  we initiated a plan to reorganize our field and claims operations 
we anticipate that reorganizing our field and claims operations will allow us to improve service  streamline workflows and better deploy new technology solutions 
under our reorganization plan  the existing field regions will be merged into five new regions  each with a regional headquarters  which we believe will allow us to be more responsive to our agents 
each region will support personal insurance sales and business 
table of contents insurance sales  underwriting  processing and administrative functions 
personal insurance underwriting  processing and administrative functions will be consolidated into two operation centers 
as part of the reorganization of our claims operations  we will expand our dedicated catastrophe team to address both the urgency and special needs of catastrophe claim handling 
many large property losses  which have been generally sent out to independent adjusters  will be handled in house by large property specialist adjusters strategically placed throughout our operating states 
new contact center property claim teams will be organized with redefined responsibilities including adjusting contents claims for larger fire losses and supporting the dedicated catastrophe team 
in addition  we expect to hire additional automobile and property appraisers to rely less on outside property and auto appraisers 
we believe this will allow us to take advantage of current technology by having many of our property and auto appraisers work from their homes  providing better access to policyholders 
casualty claims will continue to be handled in house in fewer  larger units 
we believe that having more people in fewer locations will allow us to better train new casualty claim handlers  staff more flexibly  and provide closer supervision on longer tail  third party claims 
total restructuring charges  including employee termination benefits  benefit plan curtailment impact  relocation packages  and costs associated with ceasing to use leased properties  are estimated to be approximately million through the fourth quarter  the expected completion date for the reorganization 
we recognized restructuring costs totaling million during the year ended december   which increased our gaap loss and lae and expense ratios points each

investment operations segment our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other members of the state auto group are managed by our subsidiary  stateco 
stateco utilizes outside investment managers to invest in small cap equities and international funds 
the investment committee the committee of the board of directors establishes the investment policies to be followed by stateco 
our primary investment objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain adequate liquidity for the payment of claims and expenses 
our current investment strategy does not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
our decision to make a specific investment is influenced primarily by the following factors a investment risks  b general market conditions  c relative valuations of investment vehicles  d general market interest rates  e our liquidity requirements at any given time  and f our current federal income tax position and relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed maturity investments 
we have investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed maturity investments for our insurance subsidiaries which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
for the insurance subsidiaries  the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to or less of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
our fixed maturity portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
at december   there were no fixed maturity investments rated below investment grade in our available for sale investment portfolio 
at december  and  our only investments in asset backed securities were in federal agency pools fannie mae and freddie mac and government guaranteed pools ginnie mae 
our internally managed equity portfolio invests in us large cap  dividend paying companies across many different industries selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the large cap equity portfolio 
in addition  our investment policy guidelines limit the purchase of a specific stock to no more than of the market value of the stock at the time of purchase  and no single equity holding should exceed of the total equity portfolio 

table of contents our externally managed equity portfolios invest in us small cap equities and international funds 
these managers are permitted to manage the portfolios according to their own respective portfolio objectives 
in selecting our outside investment managers we confirm that their portfolio objectives  including risk tolerance  are acceptable to us 
however  there may be slight differences in their objectives with respect to dividend payments and other constraints that we apply to our large cap equity holdings 
diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international equity funds was designed to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
we believe that in most market cycles  diversification of the portfolio will be beneficial to us  and we plan to continue to maintain a diversified portfolio 
at december   our investments in fixed maturities  equity securities and certain other invested assets were held as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss and as such are not included in the determination of net income loss

at december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different large cap stocks and small cap stocks 
the largest single position was of the equity portfolio based on fair value and the top ten positions account for of the equity portfolio 
since our equity portfolio consists primarily of large cap value oriented stocks  with a small allocation to small cap equities  when large cap stocks and or value oriented stocks perform well our equity portfolio typically performs well compared to benchmarks 
conversely  when growth stocks outperform value and or small to mid cap stocks outperform large cap stocks  our equity portfolio does not perform as well compared to benchmarks 
market risk our primary market risk exposures are to changes in market prices for equity securities and changes in interest rates and credit ratings for fixed maturity securities 
our fixed maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk whereby the value of the securities varies as market interest rates change 
we manage this risk by closely monitoring the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk and shows the effects of a parallel change in interest rates on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio excluding other debt securities as of december  millions fair value description of securities bps change bps change actual bps change bps change fixed maturities us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate securities us government agencies residential mortgage backed securities balance as of december  this table summarizes only the effects that a parallel change in interest rates could have on the fixed maturity portfolio 
this change in rates would also change the value of our liabilities and possibly other financial assets 
we caution the reader that this analysis does not take into account nonparallel changes in interest rates 
it 
table of contents is likely that some rates would increase or decrease more than others depending upon market conditions at the time of the change 
this nonparallel change would alter the value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the analysis is also limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in interest rates and the resulting fixed maturity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
we believe that the fixed maturity portfolio s exposure to credit risk is minimal as approximately of the bonds we own are rated aa or better 
we do not intend to change our investment policy on the quality of our fixed maturity investments 
the fixed maturity portfolio is managed in a laddered maturity style and considers business mix and liability payout patterns to ensure adequate cash flow to meet claims as they are presented 
we also manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances  owning some agency and us treasury securities at all times  purchasing bonds of major issuers  and purchasing bonds that are part of a medium or large issue 
the fixed maturity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either exchange rate risk or commodity risk 
we do not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
to provide us greater flexibility in order to manage our market risk exposures  we categorize our fixed maturities as available for sale 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 
we have no asset backed securities in our fixed maturity portfolio which may be labeled sub prime mortgage backed securities 
we invest only in conventional mortgage backed securities issued by a federal agency or that are us government guaranteed 
specifically  approximately million or of our available for sale investment portfolio as of december   were in either ginnie mae pools  which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government  or fannie mae or freddie mac pools 
in both fannie mae and freddie mac received additional us government backing when they were placed into conservatorship 
our fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included obligations of states and political subdivisions with a total carrying value of  million 
million of these securities  or of our municipal securities portfolio muni portfolio  were enhanced by third party monoline insurers a credit enhancement for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
a credit enhancement is not a primary consideration to us when purchasing a municipal security  as we consider the underlying credit quality of the security as the primary rating factor in our evaluation process 
of the total  million of municipal securities in our investment portfolio at december   were rated aa or better  without the benefit of a credit enhancement 
we do not believe that a loss of a credit enhancement would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as our ability and intent to hold the securities 
in addition  as of december   we had no direct investment in any guarantor including any bond insurer 
the following table details the credit ratings of our municipal securities  excluding credit enhancements  based on ratings by nationally recognized rating agencies

under this provision  our original reinsurance coverage limits are automatically restored in consideration of an additional reinstatement premium reinstatement premium 
the estimated direct ultimate loss resulting from hurricane ike exceeded our retention  thereby causing two premium transactions to occur an acceleration of the recognition of the original annual premium to the date of loss occurrence in proportion to the reinsurance coverage exhausted and the recognition of the reinstatement premium from the date of the loss occurrence to the end of the coverage period june  
additionally  during the fourth quarter we entered into a separate property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement third event agreement  which provides additional coverage in excess of our retention through our remaining coverage period june

table of contents personal insurance segment revenue our personal insurance segment consists primarily of auto standard and nonstandard and homeowners products  with personal auto representing of our total consolidated net written premium in and our strategy to grow our personal lines business includes introducing our products  enhanced systems and easier to use technologies into new states 
during  we began introducing our personal lines products and technologies into texas through the independent agent distribution channel as a result of state auto mutual s acquisition of the beacon insurance group in early in addition  future plans include leveraging our relationship with the patrons insurance group distribution channel to add upgraded product lines and technologies into connecticut 
during  we continued to enhance our personal lines point of sale portal  netxpress 
the additional integration with the systems commonly used by our independent agents has resulted in an increase in the number of quotes for personal auto and homeowners 
in  for the state auto group  quotes were handled on netxpress with  of those quotes initiated from the integration mentioned above 
in  a total of  quotes were handled on netxpress 
we have also focused on improving our policyholders ease of doing business with respect to bill payment and claim reporting and settlement

we define organic growth in this form k as premium growth excluding premium growth related to the new pool business 
our organic growth for net written premiums has been impacted by our decision in to withdraw our personal insurance products from florida beginning january  the net written premium loss from this action was million for 
table of contents standard personal auto net written premiums increased from the new pool business contributed for  while organic growth increased from the primary product contributing to our increase in organic growth in standard personal auto is our customfit sm product which uses a multivariate rating approach that broadens the underwriting and eligibility guidelines for new and existing customers 
since introducing the first generation of the customfit product in  we now offer this product in most of our operating states and have seen significant improvement in our net written premiums production trends for new business in these states 
in late  we began introducing the second generation of customfit and during we continued migrating customfit states to the second generation product which increases the number of pricing points significantly 
we believe independent agents value ease of doing business and make it an important factor in their choice of insurance companies when quoting personal auto products to their customers 
to assist in this area  in early  we began implementing comparative rating tools which allow agents to receive rate quotes from multiple insurance companies by entering the rating information only one time 
to date  we have implemented different integration points to our personal lines rating engine thus eliminating duplicate entry for agents 
we believe agents will quote and write more personal standard and nonstandard auto and homeowners insurance with us as a result of a more efficient quoting process combined with more competitive rates resulting from the ongoing introduction of customfit for standard auto and refined pricing for nonstandard auto 
nonstandard auto net written premium decreased from this decrease was due to tightening underwriting controls and aggressive rate actions which contributed to a decline in our new business writings 
these actions were taken to drive an improvement in our underwriting results 
see sap loss and lae ratios table in the losses and lae section included in this item homeowners net written premium increased from the new pool business contributed while organic growth increased from we have undertaken new homeowners pricing and product initiatives  such as various new home discounts that complement our customfit automobile rollout  in order to improve our premium growth 
during  we experienced premium growth in most of our states 
other personal net written premium increased from  with coming from organic growth and from new pool business 
other personal includes primarily our farmowners line of business where we expanded into four new states  which accounts for much of the organic growth in this line 

table of contents business insurance segment revenue we focus our business insurance sales on small to medium sized exposures and offer a broad range of both property and liability coverages such as commercial auto  commercial multi peril  fire allied lines  other product liability and workers compensation

we are seeking to balance our traditional underwriting discipline with new products and pricing tools that support the production of profitable new business 
we continue to invest in products  processes and systems that we believe will increase our business insurance writings 
we have expanded our marketability by introducing new products  enhancing existing products and broadening eligibility 
for our property and liability business  we have also implemented a more granular pricing process that we believe will help us price risks more accurately and improve account retention 
we are pursuing the same for our commercial auto and workers compensation lines of business 
in addition  we have broadened our property  liability  auto and workers compensation pricing ranges to better recognize the spectrum of risks within our markets 
this year  we introduced an enhanced employment practices liability product to agents in all states and added enhanced functionality for agents to perform more detailed loss analysis on their existing book of business insurance policies 
in addition  we introduced our workers compensation products into west virginia  which opened this market to private insurers after operating for years as a monopolistic workers compensation state 

table of contents we also continue to improve our back office systems  such as enhancements to our insurance policy administration system  to make it easier for agents to quote and submit business insurance policies to us 
our system now allows transactions to be processed throughout the day using real time and straight through processing rather than in a large batch at night 
in addition to the efficiency gains we have achieved for internal employees  we have leveraged this real time and straight through processing functionality with bizxpress 
in  we expanded our bizxpress functionality by giving agents the ability to quote business auto policies as well as businessowners policies  a capability which we introduced to them in we are working to expand the scope of this technology for new products and additional lines of business including workers compensation 
we believe this technology investment should better position us for revenue growth opportunities in the future and start to drive efficiencies into our business model much like we have seen in personal insurance 
the majority of all transactions in business insurance utilize the straight through processing technology 
this has resulted in faster delivery of policies to our agents and their insureds for new business and endorsements 
similar to our personal lines segment  we are leveraging our relationship with the agency distribution channel as a result of state auto mutual s acquisition of beacon national in early during the fourth quarter of we introduced our business product portfolio in texas 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to leverage our relationship with the patrons mutual and litchfield agency distribution channel by completing all filing and systems work to support the introduction of commercial property  liability  auto and workers compensation products  which we introduced to connecticut agents early in loss and lae our gaap loss and lae ratio was in compared to in the increase in the gaap loss and lae ratio was largely due to an increase in catastrophe storm losses 
our catastrophe losses  which primarily impacted our property lines of business  accounted for points of the loss and lae ratio in compared to only points in our non catastrophe loss and lae ratio was in compared to in the increase in our non catastrophe loss and lae ratio was driven mostly by bodily injury claim severity in the personal and commercial auto lines 
with auto lines representing a significant portion of our earned premiums  this line of business contributed roughly of the increase in our non catastrophe ratio 
losses and loss expenses for a calendar year represent the combined estimated ultimate liability for claims occurring in the current calendar year along with any change in estimated ultimate liability for claims occurring in prior years

a tabular presentation of the million favorable development in by accident year is shown below

favorable catastrophe loss development of million was primarily associated with the accident year 
this development occurred primarily within our homeowners  fire allied and commercial multi peril lines of business

for commercial auto  rate decreases were the primary drivers of the increase in our non cat loss ratio 
for other product liability  the increase in loss ratio was driven by development of losses from prior accident years and  to a lesser extent  rate decreases 
for fire allied lines and workers compensation  the increase in loss ratio was primarily due to an increase in the severity of current year claims

calculated based on december  change from january  as shown in the table above  there was a million increase in total loss and loss expense reserves during the increase relates primarily to higher levels of reserves for catastrophe losses largely related to hurricane ike and an increase in reserves corresponding to our organic growth 
we conduct periodic reviews of loss development reports and make judgments in determining the reserves for ultimate losses and loss expenses payable 
several factors are considered by us when estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure changes  anticipated inflation  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  late reported claims and other reasonableness tests 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in our estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience different from historical data  trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 

table of contents acquisition and operating expenses our gaap expense ratio was in compared to in the gaap expense ratio was negatively impacted by approximately points related to our launching of innovate sa  previously discussed  and the actions we took to reduce headcount 
in addition  during the fourth quarter we offered eligible associates an early retirement option as well as reducing staff by almost people 
combining the early retirement option  reduction in staff and not replacing open positions  we plan to reduce our headcount by approximately positions by the end of the second quarter 
the gaap expense ratio was positively impacted from by a decrease in our variable compensation programs for both our associates and agents 
these programs are directly related to our loss experience which  as previously discussed  was worse in when compared to investment operations segment our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other members of the state auto group are managed by our subsidiary  stateco

the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss and as such are not included in the determination of net income loss 
our primary investment objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain adequate liquidity for the payment of claims and expenses 
our current investment strategy does not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed maturity investments for our insurance subsidiaries which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
for the insurance subsidiaries  the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to or less of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
our fixed maturity portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
at december   fixed maturity investments rated below investment grade accounted for less than of our total available for sale investment portfolio 
at december  and  our only investments in asset backed securities were in federal agency pools fannie mae and freddie mac and government guaranteed pools ginnie mae 
our internally managed equity portfolio invests in us large cap  dividend paying companies across many different industries selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the large cap equity portfolio 
in addition  our investment policy guidelines limit the purchase of a specific stock to no more than of the market value of the stock at the time of purchase  and no single equity holding should exceed of the total equity portfolio 
our externally managed equity portfolios invest in us small cap equities and international funds 
these managers are permitted to manage the portfolios according to their own respective portfolio objectives 
in selecting our outside investment managers we confirm that their portfolio objectives  including risk tolerance  are acceptable to us 
however  there may be slight differences in their objectives with respect to dividend payments and other constraints that we apply to our large cap equity holdings 
diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international funds was designed to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
in almost all asset classes experienced a decline in value and our portfolio was not immune to this broad based decline 
we believe that in most market cycles  diversification of the portfolio will be beneficial to us and we plan to continue to maintain a diversified portfolio

the following table provides a breakdown of our investment portfolio relative to our targeted allocated percentages at december  as concerns began to arise in the market place in the last half of we took a more conservative approach to preserve higher cash balances than our targeted allocation 
as we observed markets weakening  we began holding higher cash balances to avoid selling assets at depressed prices for any cash needs that might arise in the course of business  which included settling the claim activity associated with the catastrophes previously discussed 
consequently  cash balances at year end were somewhat higher than the target

in  a million valuation allowance was established against our deferred tax asset to the extent we could not demonstrate recoverability of the asset 
the valuation allowance was allocated million to deferred tax expense associated with our otti realized investment losses recognized in the income statement and million against the unrealized holding losses on equity securities recognized through accumulated other comprehensive loss  a component of equity 
in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
the million portion of the valuation allowance reflected in the income statement had the effect of decreasing the effective tax rate benefit by percent 
no valuation allowance was held at december  liquidity and capital resources general liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our short and long term needs 
our primary sources of cash are premiums  investment income  investment sales and the maturity of fixed income security investments 
the significant outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends  interest and principal payments on debt and investment purchases 
the cash outflows may vary due to uncertainties regarding settlement of large losses or catastrophe events 
as a result  we continually monitor our investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
we maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the immediate availability of funds to pay claims and expenses 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents  and  million and  million  respectively  of total available for sale investments at fair value 
included in our fixed maturities available for sale at fair value are million and million of securities on deposit with insurance regulators as required by law at december  and  respectively 
in addition  substantially all of our fixed maturity and equity securities are traded on public markets 
for a further discussion regarding investments  see investments operations segment included in this item our insurance subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met 
however  because the stfc pooled companies participate in the pooling arrangement  they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance company 
this is because under the terms of the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and then settles the intercompany balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies within days following each quarter end 

table of contents when settling the intercompany balances  state auto mutual provides the pool participants with full credit for the premiums written and net losses paid during the quarter and retains all receivable amounts from insureds and agents and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses from unaffiliated reinsurers 
any receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged off by state auto mutual and allocated to the pool member on the basis of pool participation 
as a result  we have an off balance sheet credit risk related to the balances due to state auto mutual from insureds  agents and reinsurers  which are offset by the unearned premium from the respective policies 
while the total amount due to state auto mutual from policyholders and agents is significant  the individual amounts due are relatively small at the policyholder and agency level 
based on historical data  this credit risk exposure is not considered to be material to our financial position  though the impact to income on a quarterly basis may be material 
the state auto group mitigates its exposure to this credit risk through its in house collections unit for both personal and commercial accounts which is supplemented by third party collection service providers 
the amounts deemed uncollectible by state auto mutual and allocated to the stfc pooled companies are included in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the state auto group s reliance on ceded reinsurance is not significant in comparison to the state auto group s total statutory surplus or our total financial position 
to minimize the risk of reinsurer default  the state auto group cedes only to third party reinsurers who are rated a or better by am best and also utilizes both domestic and international markets to diversify its credit risk 
we utilize reinsurance to limit our loss exposure and contribute to our liquidity and capital resources 
for a discussion of our reinsurance arrangements  see reinsurance arrangements included in this item net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash from operations may vary from year to year if there are significant changes in underwriting results from the previous four quarters  investment income or federal income taxes 
below are the primary factors that contributed to the variance in operating cash flows for these years each quarter we settle our intercompany account from the previous quarter with state auto mutual  who acts as our cash administrator 
we receive our premiums and pay our losses and expenses through this account 
in quarters where premiums exceed losses and expenses  we receive money 
in quarters where losses and expenses exceed premiums  we pay money 
we received million  million and million through this account for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the variability between years was primarily driven by the level of catastrophe losses and the timing of their settlement  we received a federal income tax refund of million in compared to federal income tax payments of million and million in and  respectively  and cash from operations in included million due to the pooling change 
we generally manage our cash flows through current operational activity and maturing investments  without a need to liquidate any of our other investments 
however  should our written premium decline or paid losses increase significantly  or a combination thereof  our cash flows from operations could be impacted requiring us to liquidate investments at losses 
this action was not necessary in or despite the increased level of catastrophe losses 
during  and  as permitted by regulations of the internal revenue service  we made cash contributions of million  million and million  respectively  to our defined benefit pension plan on behalf of our employees 
the actuarially determined contribution to our defined benefit pension plan ranges from the minimum amount we would be required to contribute to the maximum amount that would be tax deductible 
amounts contributed in excess of the minimum are deemed voluntary while amounts in excess of the maximum would be subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible for tax purposes 
amounts paid in each of these three years were within the minimum and maximum funding amounts that would be deductible for tax purposes 
the actuarially determined funding amount to the plan is generally not determined until the second

the following contributed to the fluctuations between those years in the last half of  as markets began to weaken  we took a conservative approach to investing 
we maintained higher cash balances to avoid selling assets at depressed prices for any cash needs  such as paying the claims associated with the high level of catastrophes occurring during the second half of the year 
during  as markets improved and claim activity settled into lower levels than  we began reinvesting as opportunities arose 
the decline in cash used in investing activities in versus was primarily the result of an increase in the accumulation of cash for future claims settlements and intercompany payments to affiliates and to pay shareholder dividends 
our financing activities for  and produced net cash outflows of million  million  and million  respectively 
the following contributed to the fluctuations between those years dividends paid to shareholders totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively

reinsurance arrangements members of the state auto group follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the state auto group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
each member of the state auto group is party to working reinsurance treaties for casualty  workers compensation and property lines with several reinsurers arranged through a reinsurance intermediary 
these agreements are described in more detail below 
we have also secured other reinsurance to limit the net cost of large loss events for certain types of coverage written in certain companies  including reinsurance covering umbrella liability losses up to a limit of million with a maximum of million retention 
the state auto group also makes use of facultative reinsurance for unique risk situations 
facultative reinsurance provides for a separate reinsurance agreement covering a particular risk or insurance policy 
the state auto group also participates in state insurance pools and associations 
in general  these pools and associations are state sponsored and or operated  impose mandatory participation by insurers doing business in that state  and offer coverage for hard to place risks at premium rates established by the state sponsor or operator  thereby transferring risk of loss to the participating insurers in exchange for premiums which may not be commensurate with the risk assumed 
the casualty excess of loss reinsurance agreement provides that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of a covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
also  certain unusual claim situations involving bodily injury liability  property damage  uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are covered by an arrangement that provides for million of coverage in excess of million retention for each loss occurrence 
this layer of reinsurance sits above the million excess of million arrangement 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the workers compensation excess of loss reinsurance agreement provides that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
net retentions under this agreement may be submitted to the casualty excess of loss agreement  subject to a limit of million per loss occurrence 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
in addition to the workers compensation reinsurance described above  each company in the state auto group is party to an agreement which provides an additional layer of reinsurance for workers compensation losses involving multiple workers 
subject to million of retention  reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
this coverage is subject to a maximum any one life limitation of million 
this limitation means that losses associated with each worker may contribute no more than million to covered loss under this agreement 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the property per risk excess of loss reinsurance agreement provides that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of each covered loss  as well as an additional million in aggregate retention per treaty year 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 

table of contents members of the state auto group maintain a property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering catastrophe related events affecting at least two risks 
on a combined basis  the members of the state auto group retain the first million of catastrophe loss  each occurrence  with a co participation on the next million of covered loss  each occurrence 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered losses  each occurrence 
our companies are responsible for losses above million 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
members of the state auto group also maintain a property catastrophe net aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement the catastrophe aggregate agreement 
the agreement  which was reviewed and renewed as of january   provides reinsurance coverage on an annual basis for certain qualifying catastrophic events  including certain events falling below the million retention under the property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement previously described 
events covered by the catastrophe aggregate agreement must be pcs numbered catastrophes  excluding earthquakes and named storms such as hurricanes and tropical storms 
individual occurrences are capped at million and are subject to a million franchise deductible  meaning occurrences producing losses totaling less than million are excluded 
subject to these limitations  qualifying losses from individual occurrences are then aggregated over the course of the reinsurance term  january  through december  on an aggregate basis the members of the state auto group combined retain the first million of covered loss  with a co participation on the next million of covered loss

regulatory considerations at december   and  each of our insurance subsidiaries was in compliance with statutory requirements relating to capital adequacy 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic utilizes a collection of analytical tools designed to assist state insurance departments with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
one such set of analytical tools is key financial ratios that are known in the insurance industry as the iris ratios 
iris ratios are derived from financial statements prepared on a statutory accounting basis  which are accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department with regulatory authority over our insurance subsidiaries 
a defined range of results for each ratio has been established by the naic for solvency monitoring 
while management utilizes each of these iris ratios in monitoring our insurance companies operating performance on a statutory accounting basis each of our insurance subsidiaries operates within the defined range for the other measures  the net written premium to statutory surplus ratio the leverage ratio is monitored to ensure that each of our insurance subsidiaries continue to operate within the defined range of to the higher the leverage ratio  the more risk a company bears in relation to statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
in considering this range  management also considers the distribution of net premiums between property and liability lines of business 
a company with a larger portion of net premiums from liability lines should generally maintain a lower leverage ratio 
the leverage ratios decreased slightly in while premiums grew  surplus increased 
the increase in surplus was driven by unrealized holding gains on investments and net investment income 
the statutory leverage ratios for our insurance subsidiaries at december   and were as follows statutory leverage ratios state auto p c milbank farmers sa ohio sa national weighted average we use the statutory leverage ratio as there is no comparable gaap measure 
table excludes the one time impact on net written premiums of million that occurred in conjunction with the pooling changes 

table of contents our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to state auto financial which in turn may be used by state auto financial to pay dividends to stockholders or to make principal and interest payments on debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay without prior approval 
under current law  at december  million is available in for payment as a dividend from our insurance subsidiaries to state auto financial  without prior approval from our respective domiciliary state insurance departments 
in  and  state auto financial received million  million and million  respectively in dividends from its insurance subsidiaries 
we are required to notify the insurance subsidiaries applicable state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all such dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary state commissioner of each insurance subsidiary has the authority to limit a dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations 
state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business 
the naic has developed risk based capital rbc requirements 
rbc attempts to relate an individual insurance company s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations 
rbc requires the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
at december   the ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level of state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries ranged from to 
credit and financial strength ratings the following table summarizes our credit and insurance company financial strength ratings as of february  am best moody s standard poor s stfc credit rating a baa bbb stfc pooled companies financial strength a a a sa national financial strength a n a a we are reviewed regularly by the independent rating agencies listed in the table above 
ratings provide a meaningful way for policyholders  agents  creditors and stockholders to compare us to our competitors 
the published credit ratings on state auto financial senior notes discussed above are opinions as to the ability of state auto financial to meet its ongoing obligations under the terms of the senior notes 
generally  credit ratings affect the cost  type and availability of debt financing 
higher rated securities receive more favorable pricing and terms relative to lower rated securities at the time of issue 
state auto financial s senior notes have been rated investment grade by each agency 
in february moody s lowered our credit rating from baa to baa due to moody s belief that the debt incurred by state auto mutual in connection with its acquisition of rockhill holding company will reduce the ability of state auto mutual to offer contingent support to us 
contingent support had been the rationale for narrower notching between our credit rating and insurance financial strength rating two notches instead of the customary three for us insurance holding companies 
the published financial strength ratings on the insurance company subsidiaries of state auto financial are opinions as to the ability of those companies to meet their ongoing obligations to their policyholders 
the am best financial strength ratings influence our ability to write insurance business as agents and policyholders generally prefer higher rated companies 
lower rated companies may be required to compete for agents and policyholders by offering higher commissions or lower premiums and expanded coverage  or a combination 
table of contents thereof 
state auto mutual has received am best s a or higher rating every year since the stfc pooled companies and the mutual pooled companies are collectively assigned a pool rating by am best while sa national is rated by a 
m 
best as a part of the total group 
our ratings are influenced by many factors including operating and financial performance  asset quality  liquidity  financial leverage  exposure to catastrophe risks and operating leverage 
presently  our am best  moody s and standard poor s ratings are assigned stable outlooks 
other impact of inflation inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  we attempt to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
even when general inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  is relatively modest  as has been the case over the last several years  price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims can steadily increase 
for example  medical care costs have risen at a higher rate than general inflation over the last few years 
costs for building materials typically rise dramatically following substantial widespread natural catastrophes  such as the industry experienced in florida and other states in in mississippi and alabama in  and more recently with hurricane katrina in we continue to adjust our pricing projections to reflect current and anticipated changes in costs in all lines of business 
we consider inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and final settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses 
new accounting standards adoption of recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements and disclosures investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance on the fair value measurements and disclosures of investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent

the revised guidance  which was issued as sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  has not yet been adopted into the codification 
the revised guidance reflects the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation of the previous guidance for determining which company  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the revised guidance requires an analysis of whether a company has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses that could potentially be significant to the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity 
an entity is required to be re evaluated as a variable interest entity when the holders of the equity investment at risk  as a group  lose the power from voting rights or similar rights to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
additional disclosures are required about a company s involvement in variable interest entities and an ongoing assessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary
