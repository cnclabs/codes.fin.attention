at march   we had  employees  or team members  and for the fiscal year ended march   we had revenue of million and income from operations of million 
in our fiscal year ended march   our revenue decreased to million as compared to million in our fiscal year ended march  net income remained relatively unchanged at million in our fiscal year ended march  as compared to our fiscal year ended march  the key drivers of the decrease in revenue in our fiscal year ended march  were as follows lower revenue contribution from our existing clients  including two of our largest clients conclusion of certain projects or engagements with certain clients appreciation of the us dollar against us pound sterling the key drivers of our net income remaining relatively unchanged in our fiscal year ended march  as compared to fiscal year march  were as follows lower revenue partially offset by decreased cost of revenue driven by fewer it professionals and higher utilization foreign exchange losses due to intercompany balances on november   we expanded our service offerings in the insurance and healthcare industries through the acquisition of the issued and outstanding stock of insource holdings  inc insource and its subsidiaries for million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments  as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
on february   we extended our enterprise application  rationalization and modernization capabilities and service offerings through the acquisition of the business and certain assets of convista consulting  llc convista for million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments  as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
high repeat business and client concentration is common in our industry 
during our fiscal year ended march   of our revenue was derived from clients who had been using our services for more than one year 
accordingly  our global account management and service delivery teams focus on expanding client relationships and converting new engagements to long term relationships to generate repeat revenue and expand revenue streams from existing clients 
we also have a dedicated business development team focused on generating engagements with new clients to continue to expand our client base  and over time  reduce client concentration 
we perform our services under both time and materials and fixed price contracts 
revenue from fixed price contracts was   and of total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the decreased revenue earned from fixed price contracts reflects our clients preferences 
as an it services company  our revenue growth has been  and will continue to be  highly dependent on our ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain skilled it professionals 
there is intense competition for it professionals with the skills necessary to provide the type of services we offer 
we closely monitor our overall attrition rates and patterns to ensure our people management strategy aligns with our growth objectives 
for the last twelve months ended march   our voluntary attrition rate was  while our involuntary attrition rate was 
if our attrition rate increases or is sustained at higher levels  our growth may slow and our cost of attracting and retaining it professionals could increase 
we have continued to maintain an eight quarter hedging program  which we believe has been effective since inception at reducing the impact of fluctuations in local currencies on our operating results  although there is no assurance that this hedging program will continue to be effective 
these hedges may also cause us to forego benefits of a positive currency fluctuation  especially given the volatility of these currencies 
in addition  to the extent that these hedges cease qualify for hedge accounting  we may have to recognize gains or losses on the aggregate amount of hedges placed earlier than expected 

table of contents we monitor a number of operating metrics to manage and assess our earnings  including days sales outstanding  or dso  is a measure of the number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding based upon the last days of revenue activity  which indicates the timeliness of our cash collection from clients and our overall credit terms to our clients 
dso was days and days as of march  and march   respectively 
higher dso reduces our cash balance because the revenue to cash conversion process takes longer 
realized billing rates are the rates we charge our clients for our services  which reflect the value our clients place on our services  market competition and the geographic location in which we perform our services 
our realized billing rates have marginally increased for our fiscal year ended march  as compared to our fiscal year ended march  any increase in realized billing rates is a result of our ability to successfully preserve or increase our billing rates with existing and or new clients 
average cost per it professional is the sum of team member salaries  including variable compensation  and fringe benefits  divided by the average number of it professionals during the period 
we experienced an increase in our average cost per it professional in asia from our fiscal year ended march  to our fiscal year ended march   primarily driven by competition and industry wide wage increases 
utilization rate is the percentage of time billable it professionals are deployed on client engagements  which indicates the efficiency of our billable it resources 
our utilization rate is defined as number of billable hours in a given period of time divided by the total number of available hours of our it professionals in a given period of time  excluding trainees 
we track our utilization rates to measure revenue potential and gross profit margins 
management s targeted range for utilization is between and 
generally  gross margin moves directionally with utilization rate 
utilization is affected by the rate of quarterly sequential revenue growth 
in growth periods  utilization tends to rise as more resources are deployed to meet rising demand 
utilization rates above the target may also indicate that there are insufficient it professionals to staff existing or future engagements which may result in loss of revenue or liability to service client engagements 
attrition rate is the ratio of terminated team members during the latest twelve months to the total number of team members at the end of such period  which measures team member turnover 
increased voluntary attrition rates result in increased hiring  training and boarding costs and productivity losses  which may affect our revenue  gross margin and operating profit margin 
our voluntary attrition rate was  while our involuntary attrition was  for the fiscal year ended march  our voluntary attrition rate was for our fiscal year ended march   while our involuntary attrition rate was for the same fiscal year 
operating expense efficiency is a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
if we continue to successfully grow our revenue  we anticipate that operating expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue as such expenses are absorbed across a larger revenue base 
in the near term  however  any operating expense efficiency may decline if our revenue declines 
effective tax rate is our worldwide tax expense as a percentage of our consolidated net income before tax  which measures the impact of income taxes worldwide on our operations and net income 
we monitor and assess our effective tax rate to evaluate whether our tax structure is competitive as compared to our industry 
our effective tax rate was for the fiscal years ended march  and onsite to offshore mix is the measurement of hours billed by resources located offshore to hours billed by our team members onsite over a defined period 
we strive to manage both fixed price contracts and time and materials engagements to a highly efficient  or better  onsite to offshore service delivery team mix 

table of contents sources of revenue we generate revenue by providing it services to our clients located primarily in the north america and europe 
we have historically earned and believe that over the next few years we will continue to earn a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients 
for the fiscal year ended march   collectively  our five largest and ten largest clients accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
our three largest clients accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenue for the fiscal year ended march  the loss of any one of our major clients could reduce our revenue and operating profit and harm our reputation in the industry 
during the fiscal year ended march   of our revenue was generated in the north america  in europe and in rest of the world 
we provide it services on either a time and materials or a fixed price basis 
for the fiscal year ended march   the percentage of revenue from time and materials and fixed price contracts was and  respectively 
revenue from services provided on a time and materials basis is derived from the number of billable hours in a period multiplied by the contractual rates at which we bill our clients 
revenue from services provided on a fixed price basis is recognized as efforts are expended pursuant to the percentage of completion method 
revenue also includes reimbursements of travel and out of pocket expenses with equivalent amounts of expense recorded in costs of revenue 
most of our client contracts  including those that are on a fixed price basis  can be terminated by our clients with or without cause on to days prior written notice 
all fees for services provided by us through the date of cancellation are generally due and payable under the contract terms 
our unit pricing is driven by business need  delivery timeframes  complexity of the engagement  operating differences such as onsite offshore ratio  competitive environment and engagement size or volume 
as a pricing strategy to encourage clients to increase the volume of services that we provide to them  we may  on occasion  offer volume discounts 
we manage our business carefully to protect our account margins and our overall profit margins 
we find that our clients generally purchase on the basis of total value  rather than on minimum cost  considering all of the factors listed above 
while we are subject to the effects of overall market pricing pressure  we believe that there is a fairly broad range of pricing offered by different competitors for each service we provide 
we believe that no one competitor  or set of competitors  sets pricing in our industry 
we find that our unit pricing  as a result of our global delivery model  is generally competitive with other firms who operate with a predominately offshore operating model 
the proportion of work performed at our offshore facilities and at onsite client locations varies from period to period 
effort  in terms of the percentage of hours billed to clients by onsite resources  was and of total hours billed in each of the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  while the revenue from resources located onsite and offshore accounted for and respectively in the fiscal year ended march   and and respectively during the fiscal year ended march  we charge higher rates and incur higher compensation costs and other expenses for work performed at client locations in the united states and the united kingdom as compared to work performed at our global delivery centers in india and sri lanka 
services performed at client locations or at our offices in the united states or the united kingdom generate higher revenue per capita at lower gross margins than similar services performed at our global delivery centers in india and sri lanka 
we manage to a  or better  onsite to offshore service delivery mix and intend to manage to an efficient onsite to offshore service delivery ratio for the foreseeable future 
costs of revenue and gross profit costs of revenue consist principally of payroll and related fringe benefits  reimbursable and non reimbursable costs  immigration related expenses  fees for subcontractors working on client engagements and share based compensation expense for it professionals including account management personnel 

table of contents wage costs in india and sri lanka have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the united states and europe for comparably skilled it professionals 
however  wages in india and sri lanka are increasing in local currency  which will result in increased costs for it professionals  particularly project managers and other mid level professionals 
we may need to increase the levels of our team member compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive without the ability to make corresponding increases to our billing rates 
compensation increases may reduce our profit margins  make us less competitive in pricing potential projects against those companies with lower cost resources and otherwise harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we deploy a campus hiring philosophy and encourage internal promotions to minimize the effects of wage inflation pressure and recruiting costs 
additionally  any material appreciation in the indian or sri lankan rupee against the us dollar or uk pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our cost of services 
our revenue and gross profit are also affected by our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our it professionals and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we define utilization rate as the total number of days billed in a given period divided by the total available days of our it professionals during that same period  excluding trainees 
we manage employee utilization by continually monitoring project requirements and timetables to efficiently staff our projects and meet our clients needs 
the number of it professionals assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
an unanticipated termination or reduction of a significant project could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned it professionals  thereby lowering our utilization rate 
although  we have adopted an eight quarter cash flow hedging program to minimize the effect of the indian rupee movement on our financial condition  these hedges may not be effective or may cause us to forego benefits  especially given the volatility of these currencies 
in addition  to the extent that these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting  we may have to recognize gains or losses on the aggregate amount of hedges remaining outstanding as of the balance sheet date 
operating expenses operating expenses consist primarily of payroll and related fringe benefits  commissions  selling  share based compensation and non reimbursable costs  as well as promotion  communications  management  finance  administrative  occupancy  marketing and depreciation and amortization expenses 
in the fiscal years ended march   and  we invested in all aspects of our business  including sales  marketing  it infrastructure  facilities  human resources programs and financial operations 
additionally  any material appreciation in the indian or sri lankan rupee against the us dollar or us pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our cost of operating expenses 
other income expense other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  investment gains and losses  foreign currency transaction gains and losses and disposal of fixed assets 
we generate interest income by investing in money market instruments  short term investments and long term investments 
the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their local currencies 
foreign currency gains and losses are generated primarily by fluctuations of the indian rupee  sri lankan rupee and uk pound sterling against the uk dollar on intercompany transactions 
we place our cash in liquid investments at highly rated financial institutions based on our investment policy approval by our audit committee and board of directors 
we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
income tax expense our net income is subject to income tax in those countries in which we perform services and have operations  including india  sri lanka  the united kingdom and the united states 
in previous fiscal years  we accumulated net operating loss carry forwards which were used to offset us taxable income into fiscal we have benefited from long term income tax holiday arrangements in both india and sri lanka that are offered to certain export oriented it services firms 
as a result of these net operating losses and tax 
table of contents holiday arrangements  our worldwide profit has been subject to a relatively low effective tax rate as compared to the statutory rates in the countries in which we operate 
the effect of the income tax holidays increased our net income in the fiscal years ended march  and by million and million  respectively 
as our tax holidays expire  such as the hyderbad stp holiday which expired on march   our effective tax rate is likely to increase  which may have a negative impact on our earnings 
our effective tax rate was for each of the fiscal years ended march  and our effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the geographic distribution of our earnings  as well as the availability of tax holidays in india and sri lanka 
application of critical accounting estimates and risks our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue and expenses  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements when both of the following are present the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment  and the use of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
those estimates critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are listed below 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from a variety of it consulting  technology implementation and application outsourcing services 
our services are performed under both time and material and fixed price arrangements 
all revenue is recognized pursuant to us gaap 
revenue is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees billed on a time and materials basis  we generally recognize revenue as the service is performed 
fixed price engagements are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we estimate the percentage of completion by comparing the actual number of work days performed to date to the estimated total number of days required to complete each engagement 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs to completion  including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in other engagement related costs 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs to completion are continually monitored during the term of the contract and are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
unforeseen circumstances may arise during an engagement requiring us to revise our original estimates and may cause the estimated profitability to decrease 
when revisions in estimated contract revenue and efforts are determined  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are first identified 
valuation and impairment of investments and or marketable securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale or trading securities  and carry them at fair market value 
changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date are recorded in the period in which they occur 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax effect  for available for sale securities is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the difference 
table of contents between amortized cost and fair market value for trading securities is reflected in other income  net on our consolidated statements of income 
investments and or marketable securities classified as available for sale are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of our investment securities to determine if the decline in fair value of any security is deemed to be other than temporary 
other than temporary impairment losses are recognized on securities when i the holder has an intention to sell the security  ii it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold prior to recovery  or iii the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
other than temporary losses are reflected in earnings as a charge against gain on sale of investments to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses 
the amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
we have no intention to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position at march  nor is it more likely than not that we would be required to sell such securities prior to the recovery of the unrealized losses 
as of march   we believe that all impairments of investment securities are temporary in nature 
our investments in auction rate securities and the related put option are valued primarily based on an income approach using an estimate of future cash flows because there are currently no active markets or observable market prices 
we have estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis which considered the following key inputs i the underlying structure and maturity of each security  ii the timing of expected future principal and interest payments  and iii discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on intercompany transactions and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
certain of these transactions meet the criteria for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges under accounting standards codification 
changes in the fair values of these hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
changes in the fair value for other derivative contracts and the ineffective portion of hedging instruments  if any  are recognized in the consolidated statements of income of each period and are included in foreign exchange gains losses  net and other income expense  net  respectively 
we value our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies 
any significant change in the forward or spot prices for currencies would have a significant impact on the value of our derivatives 
goodwill and other intangible assets we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price for acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including other intangible assets  is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  defined as the company level  at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or circumstances occur that indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions  and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 
the first step step of impairment testing requires a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to carrying value to identify potential impairment 
we have only one reporting unit and one reportable 
table of contents segment 
the reporting unit s fair value is compared to market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of the fair value measurement 
the second step step of impairment testing is necessary only if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the excess goodwill is recognized as an impairment loss 
other intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred 
we test other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its net undiscounted cash flows  then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
we use a discounted cash flow approach or other methods  if appropriate  to assess fair value 
the intangible impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level  and the company is considered a single reporting unit for goodwill and intangible impairment testing purposes 
income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
we record liabilities for estimated tax obligations in the united states and other tax jurisdictions 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  tax reserves  deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance  if any  involves judgment 
we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including india  sri lanka  the united states  the united kingdom  and the netherlands  and these calculations and determinations can involve complex issues which require an extended period of time to resolve 
in the year of any such resolution  additional adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income 
our overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a variety of factors  including arm s length prices for our intercompany transactions  changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income  as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
applicable transfer pricing regulations require that transactions between and among our subsidiaries be conducted at an arm s length price 
on an ongoing basis  we estimate appropriate arm s length prices and use such estimates for our intercompany transactions 
at each financial statement date  we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
this evaluation considers the weight of all available evidence  including both future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize a recognized deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made resulting in a decrease in income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we will be able to realize all or part of an unrecognized deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made resulting in an increase to income or equity in the case of excess stock option tax benefits 
we have benefited from long term income tax holiday arrangements in both india and sri lanka 
one of our indian subsidiaries is an export oriented company that is entitled to claim a tax exemption for a period of ten years for each software technology park  or stp  it operates 
our stp holiday for chennai  india will be completely phased out by march and subsequent to that date  any profits will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate  which is currently 
during the fiscal year ended march   most of our profits in india were generated from our stps 
although we believe we have complied with  and are eligible for the stp holidays  it is possible that upon examination the government of india may deem us ineligible for the stp holidays or make adjustments to the profit level 
we have located new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones  or sezs  to secure additional tax exemptions for 
table of contents these operations for a period of ten years  which could extend to years if we meet certain reinvestment requirements 
our sri lankan subsidiary has been granted an income tax holiday by the sri lanka board of investment which expires on march  the tax holiday is contingent upon a certain level of job creation by us during a given timetable 
any inability to meet the agreed upon level or timetable for new job creation would jeopardize the benefits from this holiday arrangement 
primarily as a result of these tax holiday arrangements  our worldwide profit has been subject to a relatively low effective tax rate  and the loss of any of these arrangements would increase our overall effective tax rate and reduce net income 
it is our intent to reinvest all accumulated earnings from india and sri lanka back into their respective operations to fund growth 
as a component of this strategy  we do not accrue incremental us taxes on indian  sri lanka  or uk earnings as these earnings are considered to be permanently or indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
if such earnings were to be repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested  we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings  which would increase our overall effective tax rate 
share based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of accounting standards  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of the share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term over which stock options will be outstanding before they are exercised  the expected volatility of our stock and the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we established a stock appreciation rights plan  or sar plan  during the fiscal year ended march  prior to our ipo in august  under the terms of the sar plan  all stock appreciation rights  or sars  were settled in cash and the compensation cost and future liability for these sars were determined using the fair value at the grant date and remeasuring the fair value of the vested sars at the close of each reporting period 
after our ipo  we are obligated under the sar plan to settle all sars in shares of our common stock 
therefore  the sars are now equity classified and are no longer remeasured 
the liability measured as of our ipo date was million and this amount has been reclassified as a component of additional paid in capital subsequent to our ipo 
the risk free interest rate assumptions are based on the interpolation of various us treasury bill rates in effect during the month in which stock option awards are granted 
the company s volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility rates of the common stock of its publicly held peers over periods commensurate with the expected term of each grant 
the expected term of employee share based awards represents the weighted average period of time that awards are expected to remain outstanding 
the determination of the expected term of share based awards assumes that employees behavior is a function of the awards vested  contractual lives  and the extent to which the award is in the money 
accordingly  the company has elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term or life of its share based awards due to the company s limited trading history

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance to require more detailed disclosures about the fair value measurements of employers plan assets including a investment policies and strategies  b major categories of plan assets  c information about valuation techniques and 
table of contents inputs to those techniques  including the fair value hierarchy classifications of the major categories of plan assets  d the effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level on changes in plan assets  and e significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
the disclosures are included in our fiscal year ended march  consolidated financial statements 
this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial results 
effective january  the company adopted new authoritative accounting guidance on business combination to recognize and measure all assets and liabilities assumed in the transaction and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value as of the acquisition date 
such acquisitions will now be treated as business combinations  which will require transaction costs to be expensed as incurred  may generate gains or losses due to changes between the effective and closing dates of acquisitions  and will require possible recognition of goodwill given differences between the purchase price and fair value of assets received 
the guidance further amends the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosures of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial results as our acquisitions were completed subsequent to the adoption of the guidance 
in april  the fasb issued guidance where  if an entity determines that the level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and that a transaction is not orderly  further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed  and a significant adjustment to the transaction or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value 
this guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june  with early adoption permitted for periods ended after march  we adopted this guidance for our quarter ended june   and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
in april  the fasb issued guidance that applies to investments in debt securities for which other than temporary impairments may be recorded 
if an entity s management asserts that it does not have the intent to sell a debt security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  then an entity may separate other than temporary impairments into two components the amount related to credit losses recorded in earnings  and all other amounts recorded in other comprehensive income 
this guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june  with early adoption permitted for periods ended after march  we adopted this guidance for our quarter ended june   and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
in april  the fasb issued guidance to require an entity to provide disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial information 
this guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june  with early adoption permitted for periods ended after march  we adopted this guidance for our quarter ended june   and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
effective april   we adopted guidance where unvested awards of share based payments with non forfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities for purposes of calculating earnings per share 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification 
the codification does not alter current us gaap  but rather integrates existing accounting standards with other authoritative guidance 
under the codification  there will be a single source of authoritative us gaap for nongovernmental entities and this will supersede all other previously issued non sec accounting and reporting guidance 
the codification is effective for financial statement periods ended after september  we adopted this guidance for our quarter ended september  the adoption of the codification did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial results 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued new guidance requiring supplemental fair value disclosures and providing several clarifications regarding existing disclosure requirements 
specifically  the new guidance requires an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  the new standard requires a gross presentation of the level rollforward  stating separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
the new guidance also provides clarification regarding the appropriate level of disaggregation of assets and liabilities for the purpose of fair value disclosures as well as the requirement to provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring level and level measurements 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
we have historically entered into  and in the future we may enter into  foreign currency derivative contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on both foreign currency denominated assets and forecasted expenses 
certain of these contracts meet the criteria for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges 
we evaluate our foreign exchange policy on an ongoing basis to assess our ability to address foreign exchange exposures on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income and operating cash flows from all foreign currencies  including most significantly the indian rupee  uk pound sterling  and the sri lankan rupee 
we have a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate the risks of volatility in the indian rupee against the us dollar and us pound sterling 
the us dollar equivalent market value  which consists of the notional value and net unrealized gain or loss  of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of march  was million 
recently  the us dollar strengthened materially against the us pound sterling which has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on our revenue generated in uk pound sterling 
in response to this volatility  we have entered into hedging transactions designed to hedge our forecasted sales and expenses denominated in the uk pound sterling 
the derivative contracts are less than days in duration and do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
such hedges may not be effective in mitigating this currency volatility 
during the fiscal year ended march   we made a one time reclassification of certain intercompany payables of million from short term to long term to further capitalize our uk subsidiary 
from time to time  we may also purchase multiple foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge fluctuation in foreign currencies  such as the uk pound sterling  against the uk dollar  and multiple foreign currency hedges designed to hedge foreign currency transactions and gains and losses on our intercompany balances 
assuming the amount of expenditures by our indian operations was consistent with fiscal and the timing of the funding of these operations was to remain consistent during our fiscal year ended march   a constant increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar during fiscal of would impact our net income by million excluding the effect of foreign currency derivative contracts which would offset approximately of the impact 
interest rate risk we had no debt outstanding as of march  we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
as of march   we had million in cash and cash 
table of contents equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  the interest income from which is affected by changes in interest rates 
our invested securities primarily consist of government sponsored entity bonds  money market mutual funds  commercial paper  corporate debts and auction rate securities 
our investments in debt securities are classified as either available for sale or trading and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale and trading investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates at march  would impact the net fair value of such interest sensitive financial instruments by million 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  accounts receivable  derivative contracts  other financial assets and unbilled accounts receivable 
we place our operating cash  investments and derivatives in highly rated financial institutions 
we adhere to a formal investment policy with the primary objective of preservation of principal  which contains credit rating minimums and diversification requirements 
we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties and  accordingly  do not require collateral 
credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our consolidated financial statements and have not exceeded our expectations 
as widely reported  financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have experienced disruption in recent periods  including  among other things  volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
while we do not currently require access to credit markets to finance our operations  these economic developments affect our clients in a number of ways 
any tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our clients to obtain financing for their operations and could result in decreased global it spending which  in turn  could result in delays  reductions in  or cancellation of engagements for our services 
regional and global economic weakness and uncertainty could result in some companies reassessing their spending for technology and it related projects and services 
we are unable to predict the likely condition in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states  united kingdom and other countries 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for it services from our clients  including discretionary it spending 
as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown  it is extremely difficult for us to forecast future revenue growth based on historical information and trends 
portions of our expenses are fixed and other expenses are tied to expected levels of utilization 
to the extent that we do not achieve anticipated level of revenue growth  our gross profit and net income could be adversely affected until such expenses are reduced to an appropriate level 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs  the investment firm that had sold us auction rate securities at a par value of million 
under the agreement  we received the right the put option to sell these auction rate securities back to ubs at par  at our sole discretion  any time during the period from june  through july   and gave ubs the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell these securities on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the agreement through july  we elected to measure the put option under the fair value option  and recorded income of million  and recorded a corresponding long term asset 
as a result of entering into an agreement with ubs  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on the related auction rate security investments 
simultaneously  we transferred these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading investment securities 
the recording of the put option and the recognition of the other than temporary impairment loss did not impact the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal year ended march  the value of the put option at march  was million 
we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the put option will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material net impact to the consolidated statements of income
