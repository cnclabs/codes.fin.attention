our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results and timing described in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those factors described below and above under item a 
risk factors and item business 
readers are encouraged to carefully review those risk factors 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in light of those factors and in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
overview we develop  manufacture and market highly engineered products and services in three principal business areas i capital equipment for the pv solar industry  ii biomedical and iii optoelectronics  generally bringing to bear expertise in materials technologies  surface science and thin films across all three business areas  discussed below 
in the pv solar area  we develop  manufacture and market specialized equipment for the production of terrestrial photovoltaic modules from solar cells  provide photovoltaic systems for application to powering buildings with connection to the utility grid and supplies photovoltaic materials 
our equipment has been installed in approximately factories in countries 
the equipment market is very competitive with major competitors located in japan and germany 
our flagship product is our sun simulator which tests module performance 
our other product offerings include turnkey module lines and to a lesser extent other individual equipment 
to compete we offer other services such as training and assistance with module certification 
at times  we supply materials such as solar cells to certain customers 
we also provide turnkey services to our customers to backward integrate to solar cell manufacturing 
during  we dissolved our joint venture  gloria spire solar 
we received a return of capital  hired several key employees  received pending customer contracts and have restarted a photovoltaic systems business 
our photovoltaic systems business provides an application for powering buildings with connection to the utility grid 
we do not manufacture modules  but rather procure them from multiple suppliers based upon our industry knowledge of the supply chain 
in the optoelectronics area  we provide custom compound semiconductor foundry and fabrication services on a merchant basis to customers involved in biomedical biophotonic instruments  telecommunications and defense applications 
services include compound semiconductor wafer growth  other thin film processes and related device processing and fabrication services 
we also provide materials testing services and perform services in support of sponsored research into practical applications of optoelectronic technologies 
we are developing solar concentrator cell technology to provide to high efficient cells to the industry 
in the biomedical area  we provides value added surface treatments to manufacturers of orthopedic and other medical devices that enhance the durability  antimicrobial characteristics or other material characteristics of their products  and performs sponsored research programs into practical applications of advanced biomedical and biophotonic technologies 
operating results will depend upon revenue growth and product mix  as well as the timing of shipments of higher priced products from our solar equipment line  delivery of solar systems and solar materials 
export sales  which amounted to of net sales and revenues for  continue to constitute a significant portion of our net sales and revenues 
results of operations the following discussions of our results of continuing operations exclude the results related to the medical products business unit  which was sold on december  the medical products business unit has been segregated from continuing operations and is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see income loss from discontinued operations below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth certain items as a percentage of net sales and revenues for the periods presented year ended december  net sales and revenues cost of sales and revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses internal research and development expenses gain on termination of contracts income loss from continuing operations other expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit provision income tax benefit provision continuing operations net income loss from continuing operations net income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss overall our total net sales and revenues for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  
the increase came primarily from our solar business unit  while our biomedical business unit achieved a small increase partially offset by a decrease in our optoelectronics business unit 
solar business unit sales in our solar business unit increased to million in as compared to million in the increase is the result of sales in solar cell materials during  partially offset by a decrease in solar equipment sales 
we did not sell solar cell materials in biomedical business unit revenues of our biomedical business unit increased to million in as compared to million in the increase reflects increased revenues from our orthopedics coatings services slightly offset by a decrease in revenue from research and development contracts 
optoelectronics business unit sales in our optoelectronics business unit decreased in to million as compared to million in the decrease reflects an overall decrease in optoelectronics activities attributable to the recent global economic recession and to a lesser extent the termination of a contract with principia lightworks  inc in march  as discussed below in gains on termination of contracts 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales and revenues the following table categorizes our net sales and revenues for the periods presented year ended december  increase decrease in thousands sales of goods contract research  service and license revenues net sales and revenues the increase in sales of goods for as compared to was primarily due to new sales in solar cell materials  partially offset by decreased solar equipment revenues 
new sales of solar cell materials  all to one customer  were million in solar equipment sales decreased in as compared to primarily due to an overall slowdown in solar power industry activity 
the decrease in contract research  services and license revenues for as compared to is primarily attributable to a decrease in optoelectronics  royalties and research and development activities  partially offset by an increase in orthopedic services 
revenue from our optoelectronics processing services spire semiconductor decreased in compared to as a result of an overall decrease in optoelectronics activities attributable to the recent global economic recession and to a lesser extent the termination of a contract with principia lightworks  inc in march see gains on termination of contracts 
revenue from royalties decreased as a result of the termination of contract with nisshinbo industries  inc in november revenues from our research and developme nt activities decreased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in the number and value of contracts associated with funded research and development 
revenues from our orthopedic activities increased in as compared to revenues from the delivery of a solar equipment cell line and a solar equipment module line to two different customers accounted for and  respectively  of total net sales and revenue for and recurring revenue from the sale of solar cell materials to another customer accounted for of total net sales and revenue during the same period 
we did not have any customers that accounted for more than of consolidated net sales and revenues in cost of sales and revenues the following table categorizes our cost of sales and revenues for the periods presented  stated in dollars and as a percentage of related sales and revenues years ended december  increase decrease in thousands cost of goods sold cost of contract research  service and licenses net cost of sales and revenues cost of goods sold increased for as compared to  primarily as a result of costs related to a two year solar materials contract of million  costs related to the completion of an automated module line and cell line and a provision for a reserve of million related to actual and estimated costs to complete two solar projects 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold was of sales of goods in as compared to of sales of goods in this increase in the percentage of sales in is due to the provision for a reserve of million related to actual and estimated costs to complete two solar projects  low margin related to the completion of an automated module line  low margin related to a solar cell materials contract and an unfavorable utilization of solar manufacturing overhead 
cost of contract research  services and licenses decreased for as compared to  primarily as a result of decreased costs at our optoelectronics facility spire semiconductor due to lower associated revenues  partially offset by increased costs of our contract research activities due to higher volumes 
cost of contract research  services and licenses as a percentage of revenue increased to of revenues in from in  primarily due to unfavorable margin related to our optoelectronics facility  partially offset by favorable margins in orthopedic services in cost of sales and revenues also includes approximately thousand and thousand of stock based compensation in and  respectively

selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in selling  general and administrative expense includes approximately thousand of stock based compensation in versus thousand in internal research and development expenses internal research and development expense increased in as compared to  primarily as a result of higher levels of research and development spent in the solar group 
as a percentage of sales and revenue  however  internal research and development expenses remained at for both periods 
gains on termination of contracts on september   nisshinbo delivered a letter to us stating its intention to terminate the global consortium agreement the consortium agreement entered into between nisshinbo and us on may   relating to the development  manufacturing and sales of solar photovoltaic module manufacturing equipment 
in accordance with the consortium agreement  nisshinbo provided its day prior notice to terminate the consortium agreement effective as of february  however  on november   we signed a separation and novation agreement the separation agreement with nisshinbo that  among other things  accelerated the termination of the consortium agreement and the payment by nisshinbo to us for an early termination penalty 
under the separation agreement  the te rmination of the consortium agreement was effective as of november  under the terms of the consortium agreement and the separation agreement  as a result of early termination by nisshinbo for convenience  we received a termination penalty payment of million in december in addition  we received a final royalty payment of approximately thousand from nisshinbo for outstanding equipment being built by nisshinbo for its customer base 
we granted nisshinbo a perpetual  royalty free  non exclusive  non sub licensable for four years license to our existing solar photovoltaic module manufacturing equipment methods of engineering  designing  manufacturing and other related methods that were in effect when we entered into the consortium agreement in both parties declined technology licenses for technology developed by the other party during the term of the cons ortium agreement 
nisshinbo will continue to manufacture certain products for us on a non exclusive basis 
on august   we delivered to principia lightworks  inc principia a notice of breach and pending termination of a certain manufacturing agreement  dated august   by and between spire semiconductor and principia the manufacturing agreement 
under the terms of the manufacturing agreement  principia made an up front payment for nonrecurring engineering and facility access costs and was required to make monthly facility availability payments throughout the term of the agreement 
as a result of principia s failure to make monthly facility availability payments in  we have fully reserved thousand against principia s accounts receivable balance 
we entered into a mutual standstill agreement w ith principia  which expired on march  the purpose of the standstill was to give the parties additional time to negotiate a resolution 
on march   spire semiconductor and principia mutually agreed to terminate the manufacturing agreement for convenience and entered into a separation and novation agreement the novation agreement 
under the terms of the novation agreement  both parties agreed to terminate technology licenses that were granted to each other under the terms of the manufacturing agreement and spire semiconductor was released from its production requirements to principia 
principia was released from paying its future facility availability payments due under the manufacturing agreement but will be required to pay facility availability payments of thousand 
spire semiconductor holds  shares of principia stock as collateral against the outstanding facility availability payments 
 during the three months ended march   we accelerated the amortization of deferred revenue and recognized million as a gain on termination of contracts related to the termination of the manufacturing agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on june   we entered into a settlement agreement with marubeni corporation with respect to the license to manufacture and distribute equipment agreement the license agreement dated april  for the license of manufacturing and distribution in japan of our solar photovoltaic modular manufacturing equipment 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  both parties agreed to terminate the license agreement including but not limited to the eighteen month non compete obligation 
as a result of the settlement  we received a payment and recognized a gain on termination of contracts of thousand in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we determined that three purchase and sale agreements with jiangxi gemei sci tech  llc jiangxi related to a module equipment line and cell equipment line were terminated 
jiangxi had failed to make payments as required by the agreements and has not responded to numerous communications by us 
we made commitments to purchase equipment on behalf of jiangxi and due to jiangxi not making contractual payments  we entered into settlement agreements with these vendors 
as a result of deposits paid by jiangxi less settlements paid to vendors and inventory written off  we have recognized a gain on termination of contract of million 
other income expense  net we earned thousand and thousand of interest income in and  respectively 
the decrease in earned interest relates to the decrease in interest rates during compared with we incurred interest expense of thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the slight increase in interest expense is due to higher interest payments associated with the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities with silicon valley bank in compared with we recorded losses of  thousand and thousand on the equity investment in the joint venture with gloria solar in and  respectively 
included in this loss for is an impairment charge of thousand to reduce the value of the investment to the estimated proceeds from the liquidation of the joint venture 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we had currency exchange losses of approximately thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
income taxes we recorded a tax benefit on our loss from continuing operations of  thousand which was offset by a provision on our income from discontinued operations of  thousand 
a full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the realization of the net operating loss in the future 
a valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax assets generated in as well due to uncertainty regarding the realization of the net operating loss in the future 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million  against which a valuation allowance of million had been applied 
the remaining deferred tax assets have been offset against deferred tax liabilities 
income loss from discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we began pursuing an exclusive sales process of our medical products business unit 
on december   we completed the sale of the medical products business unit to bard access systems  inc accordingly  the results and assets of the medical products business unit are being presented herein as discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
we recorded net income from discontinued operations of million in and a loss from discontinued operations of thousand in included in discontinued operations in is a gain on sale of business unit to bard of million  an income tax provision of million and reserves for inventory and potential returns related to a voluntary recall of medical products totaling approximately million for the year ended december  not included in discontinued operations are certain indirect costs of the medical products business unit that have been reclassified to selling  general and administrative expense of thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the gain of million is proceeds received from bard of million  less inventory transferred to bard of thousand  less patents transferred to bard of thousand and less legal  professional and other fees related to complete the sale of thousand 
net income loss we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million and net income for the year ended december  of million 
the net decrease in loss of approximately million is primarily due to a decrease in gross margin of million partially offset by one time net gains on termination of contracts and gains on sale of business unit included in discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  increase decrease in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital cash and cash equivalents increased due to cash provided by investing activities  primarily due to a one time payment in of million related to the sale of the medical products business unit included in discontinued operations  partially offset by cash used in operating and financing activities 
the overall decrease in working capital is due to a decrease in current assets  primarily deferred cost of goods sold  partially offset by an increase in inventory and a decrease in advances on contracts in progress 
we have historically funded our operating cash requirements using operating cash flow  proceeds from the sale and licensing of technology and assets and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
there are no material commitments by us for capital expenditures 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million compared to accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we have numerous options on how to fund future operational losses or working capital needs  including but not limited to sales of equity  bank debt or the sale or license of assets and technology  as we have done in the past  however  there are no assurances that we will be able to sell equity  obtain or access bank debt  or sell or license assets or technology on a timely basis and at appropriate values 
we have developed several plans including cost containment efforts and outside financing to offset a decline in business due to the recent global economic recession 
as a result  we believe we have sufficient resources to finance our current operations through at least december loan agreements on may   we entered into a loan and security agreement the equipment credit facility with silicon valley bank the bank 
under the equipment credit facility  for a one year period  we could borrow up to million in the aggregate to finance certain equipment purchases including reimbursement of certain previously made purchases 
advances made under the equipment credit facility would bear interest at the bank s prime rate  as determined  plus and payable in thirty six consecutive monthly payments following the funding date of that advance 
the equipment credit facility  if not sooner terminated in accordance with its terms  expires on june  on march   we entered into a second loan and security agreement the revolving credit facility with the bank 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  the bank agreed to provide us with a credit line up to million 
on may   the bank amended the equipment credit facility and the revolving credit facility  modifying our net income profitability covenant requirements in exchange for a three quarters percent increase in our interest rate and waiver restructuring fee equal to one half percent of amounts outstanding under the equipment credit facility and committed under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  our equipment credit facility balance was to be factored in when calculating our borrowing base under the revolving credit facility 
on march   the bank extended the expiration of the revolving credit facility under the same terms in order to allow both parties the time to negotiate an expansion of the credit limit contingent upon us qualifying for an export import bank loan guarantee 
on june   we entered into two separate credit facilities with the bank providing for credit lines of up to million in the aggregate i an amended and restated loan and security agreement the restated revolving credit facility pursuant to which the bank agreed to provide us with a credit line of up to million and ii an export import bank loan and security agreement the ex im facility pursuant to which the bank agreed to provide us with a credit line of up to million to be guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states the exim bank 
our obligations under these two credit facilities were secured by substantially all of our assets 
in addition  under the restated revolving credit facility  our existing equipment credit facility with the bank was amended whereby the bank and the company agreed that there would be no additional availability under such facility and  based on an outstanding principal amount of million on june   we would continue to make monthly installments of principal of thousand plus accrued interest until the outstanding balance was paid in full the equipment term loan 
we were not in compliance with its credit facilities tangible net worth covenant as of september   and was unlikely to be in compliance on a going forward basis 
accordingly  in november  we entered into an agreement to amend and restate its two credit facilities to more closely match our business model and which contain a waiver of any prior financial covenant defaults 
on november   we entered into two separate amended and restated credit facilities with the bank continuing to provide for credit lines of up to million in the aggregate i a second amended and restated loan and security agreement the second restated revolving credit facility pursuant to which the bank agreed to continue to provide us with a credit line of up to million and ii an amendment and restated export import bank loan and security agreement the restated ex im facility pursuant to which the bank agreed to continue to provide us with a credit line of up to million to be guaranteed by the exim bank 
our obligations under these two amended credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
advances under the second restated revolving credit facility are limited to of eligible receivables 
interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at a rate per annum equal to the greater of i the prime rate plus or ii as of december   with reductions in the rate if certain events occur  as defined 
our obligations under the restated ex im facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
advances under the restated ex im facility are limited to i of eligible receivables subject to a suitable foreign currency hedge agreement if applicable  plus ii of all other eligible receivables billed in foreign currency  plus iii the of the value of eligibl e inventory  as defined 
interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at a rate per annum equal to the greater of i the prime rate plus or ii as of december   with reductions in the rate if certain events occur  as defined 
in addition  under the second restated revolving credit facility  with respect to our outstanding equipment term loan with the bank  we must continue to make monthly installments of principal of thousand plus accrued interest until the outstanding balance is paid in full 
interest on the equipment term loan continues to accrue at a rate per annum equal to the greater of i the prime rate plus or ii as of december  
under the second restated revolving credit facility and the restated ex im facility  as long as any commitment remains outstanding under the facilities  we must comply with a financial covenant by maintaining cash and availability line of million 
in addition  until all amounts under the credit facilities with the bank are repaid  covenants under the credit facilities impose restrictions on our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  create or permit liens on our assets  merge  consolidate or dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business  make dividend and other restricted payments  make certain debt or equity investments  make certain acquisitions  engage in certain transactions with affiliates or change the business conducted by us 
any failure by us to comply with the coven ants and obligations under the credit facilities could result in an event of default  in which case the bank may be entitled to declare all amounts owed to be due and payable immediately 
the maturity date for each of these facilities is may  the equipment term loan s principal balance outstanding was thousand and million at december  and  respectively 
advances outstanding under our second restated revolving credit facility was million and million at december  and  respectively 
advances outstanding under the restated ex im facility as of december  were thousand

recent accounting pronouncements effective july   we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc or codification  generally accepted accounting principles asc 
the codification  which was issued in june  is the new source of authoritative us gaap for the securities and exchange commission sec registrants 
the codification reorganizes current us gaap into a topical format that eliminates the previous us gaap hierarchy and establishes two levels of us gaap authoritative and non authoritative 
the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and carries the same level of authority as pronouncements issued under the previous hierarchy of us gaap 
the adoption of the codification did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to asc  revenue recognition  on the subtopic  multiple element arrangements 
the amendment impacts the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
additionally  the amendment modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
the amendment is effective for revenue arrangement entered or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   however early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
effective july   we adopted asc  subsequent events 
the pronouncement establishes recognition and disclosure standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance is effective on a prospective basis for interim periods ending after june  the adoption of the pronouncement did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  relative to financial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued asc paragraph a  effective date of asc  which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of asc for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of asc with respect to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
the adoption of asc did not have an impact on our financial position or res ults of operations 
in march  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to asc  derivatives and hedging 
the update to asc requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
this update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
the update to asc encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
the adoption of the update to asc did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  our business has not been materially impacted by inflation 
manufacturing equipment and solar systems are generally quoted  manufactured and shipped within a cycle of approximately nine months  allowing for orderly pricing adjustments to the cost of labor and purchased parts 
we have not experienced any negative effects from the impact of inflation on long term contracts 
our service business is not expected to be seriously affected by inflation because its procurement production cycle typically ranges from two weeks to several months  and prices generally are not fixed for more than one year 
research and development contracts usually include cost escalation provisions 
foreign currency fluctuation we sell almost exclusively in us dollars  generally against an irrevocable confirmed letter of credit through a major united states bank 
accordingly  we are not directly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations on our current orders 
however  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do have an effect on our customers access to us dollars and on the pricing competition on certain pieces of equipment that we sell in selected markets 
in addition  purchases made and historic royalties received under our consortium agreement with nisshinbo are in japanese yen 
in addition  we received japanese yen related to the termination of the consortium agreement in we have committed to purchase certain pieces of equipment from european and japanese vendors  these commitments are denominated in euros and ye n  respectively 
we bear the risk of any currency fluctuations that may be associated with these commitments 
we attempt to hedge known transactions when possible to minimize foreign exchange risk 
the hedging activities during and were not material at any point during those years 
foreign exchange loss included in other expense was thousand and thousand for the year ended december  and  respectively 
related party transactions on november   we entered into a new lease agreement the bedford lease with spi trust  with respect to  square feet of space comprising the entire building in which we have occupied space since december  the term of the bedford lease commenced on december  and continues for five years until november  we have the right to extend the term of the bedford lease for an additional five year period 
the annual rental rate for the first year of the lease is per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building 
the annual rental rate increases on each anniversary by per square foot 
if we exercise our right to extend the term of the bedford lease  the annual rental rate for the first year of the extended term will be the greater of a the rental rate in effect immediately preceding the commencement of the extended term or b the market rate at such time  and on each anniversary of the commencement of the extended term the rental rate will increase by per square foot 
we believe that the terms of the bedford lease are commercially reasonable 
rent expense under the bedford lease was million for the year ended december  and on august   we entered into a new lease agreement the hudson lease with spi trust  with respect to thousand square feet of space comprising the entire building in which spire semiconductor has occupied space since june  the term of the hudson lease commenced on september   and continues for seven years until august  we have the right to extend the term of the hudson lease for an additional five year period 
the annual rental rate for the first year of the hudson lease is per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building 
the annual rental rate increases on each anniversary by per square foot 
if we exercise our right to e xtend the term of the hudson lease  the annual rental rate for the first year of the extended term will be the greater of a the rental rate in effect immediately preceding the commencement of the extended term  or b the market rate at such time  and on each anniversary of the commencement of the extended term the rental rate will increase by per square foot 
in addition  we are required to deposit with spi trust thousand as security for performance by the company for its covenants and obligations under the hudson lease 
spi trust is responsible  at its sole expense  to make certain defined tenant improvements to the building 
we believe that the terms of the hudson lease are commercially reasonable and reflective of market rates 
the lease agreement does not provide for a transfer of ownership at any point 
the hudson lease is classified as a related party operating lease 
rent expense under the hudson lease was million an d thousand for the year ended december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances  reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation  income taxes  and warranty reserves 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that w e believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
refer to footnote of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from continuing operations from three primary sources commercial products including  but not limited to  solar energy manufacturing equipment  solar energy systems and solar energy materials  biomedical and semiconductor processing services  and united states government funded research and development contracts we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment of products provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer 
our oem capital equipment solar energy business builds complex customized machines to order for specific customers 
most orders are sold on a fob bedford  massachusetts or ex works factory basis and other orders are sold on a cip  or on rare situations  a ddu basis 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for this equipment as title of the product has passed to the customer  as customer acceptance is obtained prior to shipment and the equipment is expected to operate the same in the customer s environment as it does in our environment 
when an arrangement with the customer includes future obligations or customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when those obligations are met or customer acceptance has been achieved 
for arrangements with multipl e elements  we allocate total fees under contract to each element using the relative fair value method and revenue is recognized upon delivery of each element 
if we are not able to establish fair value of undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until customer final acceptance is obtained 
our solar systems business provides photovoltaic systems for application to powering buildings with connection to the utility grid 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for these systems as title passes  the customer accepts the system installation and interconnection to the grid is achieved 
our solar materials business supplies photovoltaic materials under a united states government contact 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for these materials as title passes and the government accepts the materials 
we recognize revenues and estimated profits on long term government contracts on the accrual basis where the circumstances are such that total profit can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and ultimate realization is reasonably assured 
we accrue revenue and profit utilizing the percentage of completion method using a cost to cost methodology 
a percentage of the contract revenues and estimated profits is determined utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated cost to complete on a contract by contract basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes and facts  and any losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
some of the contracts include provisions to withhold a portion of the contract value as retainage until such time as the united states government performs an audit of the cost incurred under the contract 
our policy is to take into revenue the full value of the contract  including any retainage  as it performs against the contract since we have not experienced any substantial losses as a result of audits performed by the united states government 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
we actively pursue collection of past due receivables as the circumstances warrant 
customers are contacted to determine the status of payment and senior accounting and operations management are included in these efforts as is deemed necessary 
a specific reserve will be established for past due accounts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
we do not record an allowance for government receivables and invoices backed by letters of credit as realizability is reasonably assured 
bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified 
there is no dollar threshold for account balance write offs 
 while rare  a write off is only recorded when all efforts to collect the receivable have been exhausted 
impairment of long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
asc requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carryin g amount or fair value less costs to sell 
stock based compensation we account for its stock based compensation plans in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc compensation stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as our method for determining the fair value of stock option grants 
asc requires the fair value of all share based awards that are expected to vest to be recognized in the statements of operations over the service or vesting period of each award 
we use the straight line method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense for all stock option grants over the requisite service period 
warranty we provide warranties on certain products and services 
our warranty programs are described below spire solar equipment warrants solar energy module manufacturing equipment sold for a total of days  the first days of which include the replacement of defective component parts and the labor to correct the defect and the next days of which include only the cost of defective component parts 
spire biomedical warrants that any of its catheter products found to be defective will be replaced 
no warranty is made that the failure of the product will not occur  and spire disclaims any responsibility for any medical complications 
spire biomedical warrants that its services only will meet the agreed upon specifications 
spire semiconductor warrants that its products will meet the agreed upon specifications 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties  determined primarily from historical information  at the time product revenue is recognized 
should actual product failure warranties differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not required as we are a smaller reporting company
