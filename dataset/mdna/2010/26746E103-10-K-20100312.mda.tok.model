item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on inflammatory and oncology indications 
our lead product dx has recently been approved under the brand name kalbitor ecallantide by the fda for treatment of acute attacks of hae in patients years of age and older 
we currently commercialize kalbitor on our own in the united states and intend to seek approval and commercialize kalbitor through partners for hae and other angioedema indications in markets outside of the united states 
in addition to its approved commercial use for hae in the united states  we are also developing dx through collaborations in other indications 
these include use of dx for the reduction of blood loss during surgery in collaboration with cubist  and for treatment of retinal diseases in collaboration with fovea  which was acquired by sanofi aventis in we are also exploring use of dx for treatment of ace inhibitor induced angioedema  a life threatening inflammatory response brought on by adverse reactions to ace inhibitors  and acquired angioedema  a condition associated with b cell lymphoma and autoimmune disorders 
beyond dx  we have also developed a pipeline of promising drug candidates using our proprietary drug discovery technology  known as phage display 
we use phage display to identify antibody  small protein and peptide compounds with potential for clinical development 
this pipeline includes dx and dx  two fully human monoclonal antibodies with therapeutic potential in oncology indications 
in  we entered into an exclusive license agreement under which sanofi aventis will be responsible for the continued development of dx dx is currently in preclinical development within our internal development pipeline 
although we use our phage display technology primarily to advance our own internal development activities  we also leverage it through licenses and collaborations designed to generate revenues and provide us access to co develop and or co promote drug candidates identified by other biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
through our lfrp  we have more than ongoing license agreements 
to date our licensees have advanced product candidates into clinical trials including one product that has received market approval from the fda 
we incurred a net loss in and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next few years 
we have generated minimal revenue from product sales to date  and it is possible that we will never have significant product sales revenue 
currently  we generate most of our revenue from collaborators through license and milestone fees  research and development funding  and maintenance fees that we receive in connection with the licensing of our phage display technology 
to become profitable  we  either alone or with our collaborators  must successfully market and sell kalbitor and develop  manufacture and market our other product candidates  including dx for indications besides hae  and continue to leverage our phage display technology to generate research funding and licensing revenue 
it is possible that we will never have significant product sales revenue or receive significant royalties on our licensed product candidates or licensed technology in order to achieve or sustain future profitability 
clinical development programs kalbitor and the dx franchise dx is a compound that we developed using our phage display technology  which we have shown in vitro to be a high affinity  high specificity inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein 
plasma kallikrein  an enzyme found in blood  is believed to be a key component responsible for the regulation of the 
table of contents inflammation and coagulation pathways 
excess plasma kallikrein activity is thought to play a role in a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  including hae 
hae is a rare  genetic disorder characterized by severe  debilitating and often painful swelling  which can occur in the abdomen  face  hands  feet and airway 
hae is caused by low or dysfunctional levels of c inh  a naturally occurring molecule that inhibits plasma kallikrein  a key mediator of inflammation  and other serine proteases in the blood 
it is estimated that hae affects between in  to in  people around the world 
despite the fact that of patients experience symptoms before age  of patients are not diagnosed until after age  which makes it difficult to accurately determine the size of the hae patient population 
hae patient association registries estimate there is an immediately addressable target population of approximately  patients in the united states 
kalbitor in december  dx was approved by the fda under the brand name kalbitor ecallantide for treatment of hae in patients years of age and older regardless of anatomic location 
kalbitor  a potent  selective and reversible plasma kallikrein inhibitor discovered and developed by dyax  is the first subcutaneous hae treatment approved in the united states 
as part of product approval  we have established a rems program to communicate the risk of anaphylaxis and the importance of distinguishing between hypersensitivity reaction and hae attack symptoms 
to communicate these risks  the rems requires a medication guide be dispensed with each dose of kalbitor and a dear healthcare professional letter be provided to doctors identified as likely to prescribe kalbitor and treat hae patients 
kalbitor should only be administered by a healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis and hae 
we have also initiated a phase observational study to evaluate immunogenicity and hypersensitivity with exposure to kalbitor for treatment of acute attacks of hae 
the study is designed to identify predictive risk factors and develop effective screening tools to mitigate the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
this year study was initiated in february dx franchise dx for treatment of other angioedemas in addition to its approved commercial use  we are also developing dx in other angioedema indications 
another form of angioedema is induced by the use of so called ace inhibitors 
with an estimated million prescriptions written annually worldwide  ace inhibitors are widely prescribed to reduce ace and generally reduce high blood pressure and vascular constriction 
it is estimated that up to of patients treated with ace inhibitors suffer from angioedema attacks  which represents approximately of all angioedemas treated in emergency rooms 
research suggests the use of ace inhibitors increases the relative activity of bradykinin  a protein that causes blood vessels to enlarge  or dilate  which can also cause the swelling known as angioedema 
as a specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein  an enzyme needed to produce bradykinin  dx has the potential to be effective for treating this condition 
we are working with investigators affiliated with the university of cincinnati as they initiate an investigator sponsored study for drug induced angioedema 
acquired angioedema is a condition associated with b cell lymphoma and autoimmune disorders 
we are currently working with dr 
marco cicardi  of the university of milan  as he initiates a compassionate use program for dx in this indication 
dx for on pump cardiac surgery industry publications report that there are an estimated one million procedures performed worldwide each year involving on pump cardiac surgery 
on pump cardiac procedures  which are 
table of contents performed for patients who have narrowings or blockages of the coronary arteries  often involve use of a heart lung machine commonly referred to as the pump 
in these procedures  the heart is stopped with medications  and the pump does the work of the heart and lungs during surgery 
this allows the surgeon to position the heart as needed  to accurately identify the arteries and to perform the bypass while the heart is stationary 
the use of the pump during cardiac procedures elicits an adverse systemic inflammatory response 
many patients undergoing on pump cardiac procedures experience significant intraoperative blood loss that requires transfusion 
plasma kallikrein has been implicated in the body s response to on pump heart surgery as a major contributor to the significant blood loss seen in on pump cardiac patients and to the pathologic inflammation that plays a role in the complications of on pump cardiac procedures 
in  we entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with cubist for the development and commercialization in north america and europe of the intravenous formulation of dx for the reduction of blood loss during surgery 
under this agreement  cubist assumed responsibility for all further development and costs associated with dx in the licensed indications in the cubist territory 
under the terms of the license agreement  we received a million upfront payment and an additional million milestone payment in in addition  we are eligible to receive i up to million in clinical  regulatory and sales based milestone payments  and ii tiered royalties  ranging from the low teens to low twenties  based on sales of dx by cubist 
cubist has assumed responsibility for two studies of dx also known internally at cubist as cb  within its licensed surgical indications 
the first  known as conserv  was a dose ranging study evaluating  and milligram doses of dx versus placebo in patients undergoing primary cabg surgery who are at a low risk of bleeding complications 
the second trial  known as conserv  compared a single milligram dose of dx to tranexamic acid in patients at a higher risk of bleeding 
in december  enrollment in both conserv and conserv was closed after a statistically significant difference in mortality was observed by the data safety monitoring board between the dx and control arms in conserv no difference was observed in serious adverse events between the active and control arm in conserv at the interim look 
cubist plans to conduct a full dataset review of safety and efficacy in the patients enrolled in both conserv and conserv and expects to be in a position to determine next steps for this program late in the second quarter of during  research and development expenses for this program totaled million and we billed cubist million for reimbursement of services related to these expenses incurred in there were no costs incurred by us in and no future expenditures are expected to be incurred by us for this program 
dx for ophthalmic indications we have entered into a license agreement with fovea pharmaceuticals sa  which was acquired by sanofi aventis in  for the development of dx for treatment of retinal diseases in the european union 
under this agreement  fovea will fully fund development for the first indication  retinal vein occlusion induced macular edema  for which a phase trial was initiated in the third quarter of we retain all rights to commercialize dx in this indication outside of the european union 
under the license agreement  we do not receive milestone payments  but are entitled to receive tiered royalties  ranging from the high teens to mid twenties  based on sales of dx by fovea in the european union 
conversely  if we elect to commercialize dx in this indication outside of the european union  fovea will be entitled to receive royalties from us  ranging from the low to mid teens  based on sales of dx outside the european union 

table of contents goals for clinical development programs our goal for the ongoing development of dx is to ensure that we and our various collaborators develop dx in multiple indications and obtain marketing approval from the fda and international regulatory agencies in such indications 
cash inflows from these programs  other than upfront and milestone payments from our collaborations will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product candidate finds acceptance in the marketplace as a treatment for its disease indication 
because of the many risks and uncertainties related to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when cash inflows from these programs will commence  if ever 
other discovery and development programs our phage display technology and expertise has allowed us to develop a pipeline of drug candidates in addition to dx of our existing pipeline candidates  the most advanced are dx and dx  two fully human monoclonal antibodies with therapeutic potential in oncology indications 
our dx antibody has a novel mechanism of action that targets the tie receptor on tumor blood vessels 
in preclinical animal models  dx has demonstrated activity against a broad range of solid tumor types 
data also indicates increased activity when combined with antiangiogenic therapies such as avastin and nexavar 
in february  we entered into agreements with sanofi aventis  under which we granted sanofi aventis exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize dx as a therapeutic product  as well as a non exclusive license to our proprietary antibody phage display technology 
under the terms of the dx license agreement  we received license fees and milestone payments of million in in addition  we are eligible to receive i up to an aggregate of million in additional license fees and milestone payments  which maximum aggregate payment assumes full development and commercial success of dx  and ii tiered royalties  ranging from the mid to high single digits  based on sales of dx by sanofi aventis 
as exclusive licensee  sanofi aventis will be responsible for the ongoing development and commercialization of dx our dx antibody is a specific inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase mmp  a protease expressed on tumor cells and tumor blood vessels 
to date  small molecule approaches have failed to produce compounds that distinguish between closely related mmps 
in contrast  our technology has allowed us to identify a highly selective inhibitor of mmp that does not inhibit other proteases that we have tested 
in animal models  dx has been shown to significantly inhibit tumor progression and metastasis in a dose dependent manner in breast  prostate and melanoma tumors 
herceptin  a leading breast cancer treatment  is effective in only the subtype of breast tumors which are her 
current data suggests that dx may be effective against both her and her breast tumors  potentially offering promise for treatment of a wider range of breast cancer patients 
dx is currently in preclinical development within our development pipeline 
given the uncertainties of the research and development process  it is not possible to predict with confidence if we will be able to enter into additional partnerships or otherwise internally develop any of these other preclinical drug candidates into marketable pharmaceutical products 
we monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and frequently evaluate our preclinical pipeline in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 

table of contents results of operations revenues 
substantially all our revenue has come from licensing  funded research and development fees  including milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators 
this revenue fluctuates from year to year due to the timing of the clinical activities of our collaborators and licensees 
our lead product dx has recently been approved under the brand name kalbitor by the fda for treatment of acute attacks of hae in patients years of age and older 
kalbitor became commercially available in february and product sales are expected to commence during the first quarter of total revenue for was million  compared with million in and million in the decrease in revenue from to is primarily due to revenue recognized in of million associated with our sanofi aventis license agreement 
under this exclusive worldwide license  sanofi aventis received rights for the development and commercialization of the fully human monoclonal antibody dx as a therapeutic product 
there was no revenue recognized associated with this license in the decrease is partially offset by an increase of million in revenue from our license agreement with cubist  as well as an increase in patent and library license revenue  including milestones and royalties 
the increase of million in revenue from to reflects revenue of million associated with our agreement with sanofi aventis  million from our agreement with cubist  and an increase in patent and library license fees  primarily due to new agreements and milestones in these increases were partially offset by million recognized in from a fully paid up license agreement with morphosys 
research and development 
our research and development expenses are summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands kalbitor costs included within research and development expenses dx drug substance manufacturing costs other research and development expenses research and development expenses less research and development expenses reimbursed by former joint venture dyax genzyme llc net research and development expenses equity loss in former joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss research and development expenses adjusted to include equity loss in former joint venture our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and related costs for personnel dedicated to research and development activities and for the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside parties to conduct research  clinical trials and to manufacture drug material prior to fda approval 
while expenses we incur on the kalbitor program for hae are included in our research and development expenses  expenses through february  were reimbursed by the dyax genzyme llc joint venture and excluded from net research and development expenses 
when we jointly funded the losses of that program with genzyme  our equity loss in joint venture represented our share of all expenses for the development of kalbitor through february  by dyax genzyme llc 
subsequent to the termination of the joint venture on february   there 
table of contents has been no reimbursement from genzyme nor any equity loss in the joint venture 
our research and development expenses fluctuate year to year as they are dependent on the timing  size and scope of our development programs 
included in research and development costs are million and million in and  respectively  for costs associated with kalbitor and dx inventory 
the decrease in kalbitor related development costs from to is primarily attributable to million of decreased clinical costs for our edema phase trial which was completed in  as well as lower personnel expenses as a result of the workforce reduction in march these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in costs to manufacture kalbitor drug substance during other research and development expenses decreased by approximately million in  primarily related to cost savings of approximately million as a result of the workforce reduction in march  and million from the closure of our liege  belgium research facility in the second quarter of license expense and other external research and development costs also decreased during the costs associated with kalbitor increased from to primarily due to increased clinical costs for our edema phase trial  as well as an increase in personnel expenses required to support the advancement of the hae program  and were partially offset by a million decrease in manufacturing costs related to the process validation campaign completed in other research and development expenses increased by approximately million from to  excluding reimbursements by the joint venture and equity loss in joint venture 
this increase was net of a million decrease associated with the closure of our liege operations in third party license fees associated with the lfrp and other licensing increased million in other development costs for preclinical candidates increased approximately million in primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses 
marketing  general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff  as well as expenses related to business development  protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  professional fees  market research and promotion activities and the reporting requirements of a public company 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the higher general and administrative costs in were primarily due to an increase in infrastructure to support plans for commercialization of kalbitor  which include the expansion of the sales and marketing department as well as other external marketing activities  and a million charge for share based compensation expense for amendments to the exercise and vesting schedules of certain options in the increase from to was also primarily due to increased infrastructure to support plans for commercialization of kalbitor 
restructuring and impairment 
in march  we implemented a workforce reduction to focus necessary resources on the commercialization of dx and to support our long term financial success 
as a result  during the first quarter of  we recorded one time restructuring charges related to the workforce reduction of approximately million 
as a result of the decrease in necessary facility space following the workforce reduction in march  we amended our facility lease during the third quarter of to reduce our leased space 
as a result  a one time charge of approximately million was recorded of which  approximately  was recorded as a result of the write down of leasehold improvements 
in  we incurred restructuring fees of million and recorded an impairment charge related to fixed assets of  in connection with the closing of our liege research facility 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in  we incurred a one time loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to fully paying off our debt with paul royalty 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in the increase is primarily due to interest on the million tranche b loan from cowen healthcare which was received in march the decrease in compared to is primarily due to replacing our loan with paul royalty in august with a lower interest loan from cowen healthcare 
interest on the paul royalty agreement was calculated using the effective interest method based on our expected future payments to paul royalty
