the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati the fhlb 
because bkfc s activities have been limited primarily to holding the shares of common stock of the bank  the following discussion of operations focuses primarily on the business of the bank

this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the purchase were recorded at estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill 
the adjustments necessary to record tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities at fair value are amortized to income and expensed over the estimated remaining lives of the related assets and liabilities 
on december   the bank completed the purchase of three banking offices of integra bank corporation s wholly owned bank subsidiary  integra bank na integra bank  located in crittenden  dry ridge and warsaw  kentucky and a portfolio of selected commercial loans originated by integra bank s covington  kentucky loan production office 
this transaction also included the deposits of two additional branches in northern kentucky where the banking offices were excluded 
this transaction added million in deposits and million in loans 
the deposits were purchased at a premium of  while the loans were purchased at an approximate discount 
the acquisition included a core deposit intangible asset of million and goodwill of million 
in a separate transaction  the bank also bought an additional million in loans from integra bank in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of at an approximate discount 
none of these purchased loans had shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination 
on december   the bank completed the purchase of tapke asset management  llc  an independent investment advisory firm headquartered in fort wright  kentucky 
as a result of this transaction the bank s client assets increased to over million 
the asset management company was purchased for million  which consisted of million in cash and million in bkfc common stock  with an additional  in contingent consideration payable in three years based on revenue retention which has a fair value of  the acquisition included a customer relationship intangible of million  a non competition agreement intangible of  a trade name intangible of  and goodwill of million 
the current economic recession like many other financial institutions  bkfc s results for the year ended december  were affected by the national economic recession 
although total loan growth in increased by as compared to  resulting in an increase in net interest income  these revenue increases were substantially offset by the significant increase in the provision for loan losses  which was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the increase reflected an increase in loans charged off in  and management s continuing concerns over the deteriorating economic conditions in the markets in which the bank operates 
the current trend remains for continued higher than normal levels of loan loss reserves  primarily a result of the current economic conditions in the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati  ohio markets in which the bank operates 
for the year ended december   net charge offs were  or 
of average loan balances as compared to figures of  or 
of average loan balances 
although the bank experienced an increase in defaults and foreclosures in fiscal year  such levels have been significantly less than other regions of the united states 
this is due  in part  to the fact that the bank s markets in northern kentucky and cincinnati  ohio have not experienced as dramatic a reduction in real estate values from previous years as compared to markets like florida and california 
as a result of management concerns over the current economic environment  individual lending authorities have been reduced  and a new loan committee structure was put into place  adding the bank s chief executive officer to the bank s loan committee to further scrutinize credit decisions 
additionally  the bank established a problem asset workout group in this group is comprised of three experienced bankers whose primary task is to reduce risk by accelerating the exit from troubled credits 
the problem asset workout group does this employing a number of strategies 
in addition  this group provides advice and support for the bank s lending professionals with respect to those relationships that are showing signs of stress  but have not elevated to the point of transfer to workout 
in addition to these monitoring and management processes  bkfc also conducts quarterly reviews and evaluations of all criticized loans 
these comprehensive reviews  which pre date the current economic recession  include the formulation of action plans and updates on recent developments on all criticized loans 
proactive management of problem loans is a high priority of the bank s senior management 

table of contents bkfc has not experienced the stress or deterioration in its residential real estate portfolio that other financial institutions may be experiencing  as residential real estate loans represent a small portion of the bank s overall loan portfolio 
the bank has not created or marketed any sub prime loan products to its customers and does not service mortgages on behalf of other institutions 
the bank follows a strategy of selling a majority of its originated residential loans in the secondary market 
in the majority of situations  the bank follows the underwriting guidelines of the various government agencies on residential real estate loans the bank seeks to portfolio 
for the year ended december   the bank s residential real estate loan production was million 
of this  sold loans totaled million  while portfolio and construction loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the average balance of amortizing portfolio loans during was million as compared to million in residential real estate charge offs in this portfolio in and were 
and 
respectively 
delinquencies have been moderate  and non accruals were at million as of december  versus million outstanding amortizing portfolio loan balances or 
the bank had residential loans on non accrual as of december   with two of those loans totaling million  or of aggregate non accrual loan balances 
the foregoing measures are a reflection of the bank s underwriting and collection practices 
the bank has also added full time equivalent resources to its collections department  allowing the bank to make more frequent and earlier collection calls  resulting in better working relationships with those borrowers who may have difficulty in making timely payments 
the current economic recession has also affected the operations of bkfc and the bank 
during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  bkfc and the bank each participated in two government programs  which had the effect of enabling it to enhance liquidity and to augment its strong capital position and otherwise facilitate its response to the economic crisis 
first  in october the bank participated in the transaction account guarantee component of the fdic s tlgp program 
second  in february bkfc participated in the cpp program  receiving  in exchange for issuing  shares of series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase approximately  shares of bkfc common stock 
neither bkfc nor the bank actively participate in any of the other federal government programs that have been instituted in response to the current economic recession 
management believes that bkfc would not be adversely affected should the fdic curtail or end the transaction account guarantee component of the tlgp program  which is scheduled to expire under current regulations on june  management further believes that bkfc would not be adversely affected should the treasury department choose to curtail or end the cpp program  given that the series a preferred stock and related warrants are perpetual instruments which will remain outstanding until bkfc elects to repurchase them as permitted by the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
until such time as the series a preferred stock and the related warrant are repurchased  bkfc will remain subject to the terms and conditions of those instruments  which  among other things  requires bkfc to obtain regulatory approval to pay dividends on common stock in excess of per common share on a semi annual basis and  with some exceptions  to repurchase shares of common stock 
further  participation in the cpp subjects bkfc and the bank to increased regulatory and legislative oversight  including with respect to executive compensation 
any new oversight  legal requirements and implementing standards under the cpp may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on bkfc s results of operations and business condition 
if bkfc was required by the treasury department to repurchase the series a preferred stock and related warrant as a result of future changes to the terms of the cpp program in connection with the curtailment or ending of such program  management believes it would need to raise additional capital to replace the series a preferred stock in order to maintain its current regulatory capital ratios 
bkfc has been responsive to its obligations to the federal government to expand the flow of credit to us consumers and businesses on competitive terms during this economic recession 
in particular  by purchasing us government agency mortgage backed securities mbs following the treasury department s investment of million in bkfc s series a preferred stock  bkfc has provided incremental liquidity to that market 
the bank has increased it holdings of us government mbs from million at december  to million and million at december  and  respectively 
due to the bank s long standing prudent lending standards  the number of non performing loans have increased at a lower rate than the overall growth rate in the total loan portfolio 
accordingly  the bank has not had a significant need to modify mortgages which are held in its portfolio

table of contents lending activities general 
as a commercial bank  the bank offers a wide variety of loans 
among the bank s lending activities are the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on nonresidential real estate  loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences  commercial loans secured by various assets of the borrower  unsecured consumer loans and consumer loans secured by automobiles  boats and recreational vehicles  and construction and land development loans secured by mortgages on the underlying property 
the following table sets forth the composition of the bank s loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated as of december  amount amount amount amount amount dollars in thousands type of loan nonresidential real estate loans residential real estate loans commercial loans consumer loans construction and land development loans municipal obligations total loans less deferred loan fees allowance for loan losses net loans 
table of contents loan maturity schedule 
the following table sets forth certain information  as of december   regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the bank s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity and the dollar amount of such loans that have fixed or variable rates within certain maturity ranges ending after due within one year due after year to years due after years total dollars in thousands commercial loans construction and land development loans total interest sensitivity with fixed rates with variable rates total nonresidential real estate loans 
the bank makes loans secured by first mortgages on nonresidential real estate  including retail stores  office buildings  warehouses  apartment buildings and recreational facilities 
such mortgage loans generally have terms to maturity of between and years and are made with adjustable interest rates arms 
interest rates on the arms adjust every one  three or five years based upon the interest rates of the applicable one  three or five year us treasury security then offered 
the bank limits the amount of each loan in relationship to the appraised value of the real estate and improvements at the time of origination of a nonresidential real estate loan 
in accordance with regulations  the maximum loan to value ratio the ltv on nonresidential real estate loans made by the bank are subject to supervisory limits 
nonresidential real estate lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than residential lending 
such risk is due primarily to the dependence of the borrower on the cash flow from the property to service the loan 
if the cash flow from the property is reduced due to a downturn in the economy  for example  or due to any other reason the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
to reduce such risk  the decision to underwrite a nonresidential real estate loan is based primarily on the quality and characteristics of the income stream generated by the property and or the business of the borrower 
in addition  the bank generally obtains the personal guarantees of one or more of the principals of the borrower and carefully evaluates the location of the real estate  the quality of the management operating the property  the debt service ratio and appraisals supporting the property s valuation 
at december   the bank had a total of million invested in nonresidential real estate loans  the vast majority of which were secured by property located in the northern kentucky metropolitan area 
owner occupied nonresidential real estate was million of the total nonresidential real estate loans 
total nonresidential real estate loans comprised approximately of the bank s total loans at such date  million of which were non performing 
residential real estate loans 
the bank originates permanent conventional loans secured by first mortgages on single family and multi family residential properties located in the northern kentucky area 
the bank also originates loans for the construction of residential properties and home equity loans secured by second mortgages on residential real estate 
each of such loans is secured by a mortgage on the underlying real estate and improvements thereon  if any 
the residential real estate loans originated for the bank s portfolio are either one or three year arms 
such loans typically have adjustment period caps of and lifetime caps of 
the maximum amortization period of such loans is years 
the bank does not engage in the practice of deeply discounting the initial rates on such loans  nor does the bank engage in the practice of putting payment caps on loans that could lead to negative amortization 
historically  the bank has not made fixed rate residential mortgage loans for its portfolio 
in order to meet consumer demand for fixed rate loans  however  the bank has originated loans for other lenders willing to accept the interest rate and credit risk 

table of contents while in a rising rate environment the delinquencies and foreclosure rates associated with rate resets on residential real estate loans would increase  this risk is somewhat mitigated by the period cap and the lifetime cap on the typical loan in the bank s residential real estate portfolio 
furthermore  the aggregate amount of residential real estate loans held by the bank do not represent a significant portion of the bank s overall loan portfolio 
accordingly  the risks associated with a material increase in delinquencies and foreclosures resulting upon the occurrence of any rate reset is minimal 
the company does not have higher risk loans such as subprime loans  alt a loans  no or few documentation loans  interest only or option adjustable rate mortgage products in its portfolio 
the majority of the bank s residential portfolio would be considered conforming loans in accordance with governmental agencies standards 
the bank requires private mortgage insurance for the amount of any such loan with an ltv in excess of 
the aggregate amount of the bank s residential real estate loans equaled approximately million at december   and represented of total loans at such date 
at december   the bank had million of non performing loans of this type 
loans held for sale 
the bank originates residential real estate loans to be sold  service released  subject to commitment to purchase in the secondary market 
these loans are fixed rate with terms ranging from fifteen to years 
at december   these loans totaled million 
commercial loans 
the bank offers commercial loans to individuals and businesses located throughout northern kentucky and the metropolitan area 
the typical commercial borrower is a small to mid sized company with annual sales under million 
the majority of commercial loans are made with adjustable rates of interest tied to the bank s prime interest rate 
commercial loans typically have terms of one to five years 
commercial lending entails significant risks 
such loans are subject to greater risk of default during periods of adverse economic conditions 
because such loans are secured by equipment  inventory  accounts receivable and other non real estate assets  the collateral may not be sufficient to ensure full payment of the loan in the event of a default 
to reduce such risk  the bank generally obtains personal guarantees from one or more of the principals backing the borrower 
at december   the bank had million  or of total loans  invested in commercial loans  million of which were non performing 
consumer loans 
the bank makes a variety of consumer loans  including automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans and personal loans 
such loans generally have fixed rates with terms from three to five years 
consumer loans involve a higher risk of default than residential real estate loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets  such as automobiles 
repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation  and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower 
in addition  consumer loan collections depend on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  illness or personal bankruptcy 
various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may also limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans 
at december   the bank had million  or of total loans  invested in consumer loans   of which were non performing 
construction and land development loans 
the bank makes loans for the construction of residential and nonresidential real estate and land development purposes 
most of these loans are structured with adjustable rates of interest tied to changes in the bank s prime interest rate for the period of construction 
a general contractor makes many of the construction loans originated by the bank to owner occupants for the construction of single family homes 
other loans are made to builders and developers for various projects  including the construction of homes and other buildings that have not been pre sold and the preparation of land for site and project development 

table of contents construction and land development loans involve greater underwriting and default risks than do loans secured by mortgages on improved and developing properties  due to the effects of general economic conditions on real estate developments  developers  managers and builders 
in addition  such loans are more difficult to evaluate and monitor 
loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which is more difficult to value before the completion of construction 
moreover  because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the ltvs and the total loan funds required to complete a project 
in the event a default on a construction or land development loan occurs and foreclosure follows  the bank must take control of the project and attempt either to arrange for completion of construction or dispose of the unfinished project 
at december   a total of million  or approximately of the bank s total loans  consisted of construction and land development loans  million of which were non performing 
municipal obligations 
the bank makes loans to various kentucky municipalities for various purposes  including the construction of municipal buildings and equipment purchases 
loans made to municipalities are usually secured by mortgages on the properties financed or by a lien on equipment purchased or by the general taxing authority of the municipality and provide certain tax benefits for the bank 
at december   the bank had million  or of total loans  invested in municipal obligation loans  none of which were non performing 
loan solicitation and processing 
the bank s loan originations are developed from a number of sources  including continuing business with depositors  borrowers and real estate developers  periodic newspaper and radio advertisements  solicitations by the bank s lending staff  walk in customers  director referrals and an officer call program 
for nonresidential real estate loans  the bank obtains information with respect to the credit and business history of the borrower and prior projects completed by the borrower 
personal guarantees of one or more principals of the borrower are generally obtained 
an environmental study of such real estate is normally conducted 
upon the completion of the appraisal of the nonresidential real estate and the receipt of information on the borrower  the loan application is submitted to the bank s loan committee if the amount and or relationship exceeds the officer s lending authority for approval or rejection 
if  however  the loan relationship is in excess of million  the loan will be submitted to the bank s executive committee for approval or rejection 
in connection with residential real estate loans  the bank obtains a credit report  verification of employment and other documentation concerning the creditworthiness of the borrower 
an appraisal of the fair market value of the real estate on which the bank will be granted a mortgage to secure the loan is prepared by an independent fee appraiser approved by the bank s board of directors 
an environmental study of such real estate is conducted only if the appraiser has reason to believe that an environmental problem may exist 
when a residential real estate loan application is approved  title insurance is normally obtained in respect of the real estate  which will secure the loan 
when a nonresidential real estate loan application is approved  title insurance is customarily obtained on the title to the real estate  which will secure the mortgage loan 
all borrowers are required to carry satisfactory fire and casualty insurance and flood insurance  if applicable  and name the bank as an insured mortgagee 
commercial loans are underwritten primarily on the basis of the stability of the income generated by the business and or property 
for most commercial loans  however  the personal guarantees of one or more principals of the borrowers are generally obtained 
consumer loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s credit history and an analysis of the borrower s income and expenses  ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral  if any 
the procedure for approval of construction loans is the same as for permanent mortgage loans  except that an appraiser evaluates the building plans  construction specifications and estimates of construction costs 
the bank also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and record of the builder 
loan origination and other fees 
the bank realizes loan origination fees and other fee income from its lending activities and also realizes income from late payment charges  application fees  and fees for other miscellaneous services 
loan origination fees and other fees are a volatile source of income  varying with the volume of lending  loan repayments and general economic conditions 
nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to yield over the life of the related loan 

table of contents delinquent loans  non performing assets and classified assets 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  the bank attempts to cause the deficiency to be cured by contacting the borrower 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly as a result of these collection efforts 
loans that are days past due and are not considered well secured and in the process of collection shall be placed on non accrual status 
under collateralized loans that are days past due shall be reviewed for full or partial charge off 
the amount charged off will be charged against the loan loss allowance 
the bank utilizes a risk rating system to quantify commercial loan quality 
the lending officer assigns a risk rating from one to eight for each loan 
classified commercial loans are those with risk ratings of seven or higher 
each loan rating is determined by analyzing the borrowers management  financial ability  sales trends  operating results  financial conditions  asset protection  contingencies  payment history  financial flexibility  credit enhancements and other relevant factors 
loans that fall into the classified categories are monitored on a regular basis and proper action is taken to minimize the bank s exposure 
losses or partial losses will be taken when they are recognized 
the bank s risk rating system was developed in a manner that is consistent with the regulatory guidance 
problem assets are classified as special mention risk rating  substandard risk rating  or doubtful risk rating 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the same weaknesses as substandard assets  with the additional characteristics that i the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable and ii there is a high possibility of loss 
the regulations also contain a special mention or also known as criticized assets category  consisting of assets which do not currently expose an institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but which possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
generally  the bank classifies as substandard all commercial loans that are delinquent more than days  unless management believes the delinquency status is short term due to unusual circumstances 
loans delinquent fewer than days may also be classified if the loans have the characteristics described above rendering classification appropriate 
the aggregate amounts of the bank s classified assets at december  and were as follows dollars in thousands special mention risk rating substandard risk rating doubtful risk rating total classified assets the following table reflects the amount of loans that are in delinquent status of to days as of december  and loans that are delinquent days or more or are in non accrual status are detailed below 
dollars in thousands loans delinquent to days to days total delinquent loans ratio of total delinquent loans to days to total loans the following table sets forth information with respect to the bank s nonperforming assets for the periods indicated 
in addition  the bank evaluates loans to identify those that are impaired 
impaired loans are those for which management has determined that it is probable that the customer will be unable to comply with the contractual terms of the loan 
loans so identified are reduced i to the

tdrs accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the modified terms 
allowance for loan losses 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments  and net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination 
at december   the bank s allowance for loan losses totaled million 
on at least a quarterly basis  a formal analysis of the adequacy of the allowance is prepared and reviewed by management and the bank s board of directors 
this analysis serves as a point in time assessment of the level of the allowance and serves as a basis for provisions for loan losses 
the loan quality monitoring process includes assigning loan grades and the use of a watch list to identify loans of concern 

table of contents the analysis of the allowance for loan losses includes the allocation of specific amounts of the allowance to individual problem loans  generally based on an analysis of the collateral securing those loans 
portions of the allowance are also allocated to loans based on their risk rating  the higher the risk rating the higher the allowance allocated to that loan 
these components are added together and compared to the balance of our allowance at the evaluation date 
a high and low range of the allowance is calculated to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for pools of loans 
the position of the allowance for loan losses within the computed range may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions of credit quality 
the following table provides an allocation of the bank s allowance for loan losses as of each of the following dates at december dollars in thousands loan type commercial real estate consumer  cra and credit cards total allowance for loan losses the bank increased its allowance for loan losses from million at december   to million at december  because the loan loss allowance is based on estimates  it is monitored on an ongoing basis and adjusted as necessary to provide an adequate allowance 
for further discussion on the allowance for loan losses see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
investment activities the investment policy of the bank is both to manage the utilization of excess funds and to provide for the liquidity needs of the bank as loan demand and daily operations dictate 
the bank s federal income tax position is also a consideration in its investment decisions 
investments in tax exempt securities with maturities of less than years are considered when the net yield exceeds that of taxable securities and the bank s effective tax rate warrants such investments

deposits and borrowings general 
deposits have traditionally been the primary source of the bank s funds for use in lending and other investment activities 
in addition to deposits  the bank derives funds from interest payments and principal repayments on loans and income on earning assets 
loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows fluctuate more in response to economic conditions and interest rates 
the bank has lines of credit established at its major correspondent banks to purchase federal funds to meet liquidity needs 
the bank may also borrow funds from the fhlb in the form of advances 
the bank also uses retail repurchase agreements as a source of funds 
these agreements essentially represent borrowings by the bank from customers with maturities of three months or less 
certain securities are pledged as collateral for these agreements 
at december   the bank had million in retail repurchase agreements 
the bank also entered into a capital lease obligation for a branch in with a term of years and a monthly payment of  deposits 
deposits are attracted principally from within the bank s designated lending area through the offering of numerous deposit instruments  including regular passbook savings accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market deposit accounts  term certificate accounts and individual retirement accounts iras 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties for the various types of accounts are established periodically by the bank s management based on the bank s liquidity requirements  growth goals and market trends 
the bank may on occasion use brokers to attract deposits 
the bank had million in brokered deposits as of december  the following table presents the amount of the bank s jumbo certificates of deposit with principal balances greater than  by the time remaining until maturity as of december  maturity at december  dollars in thousands three months or less over months to months over months to months over months total short term borrowings 
in addition to repurchase agreements  the bank has agreements with correspondent banks to purchase federal funds on an as needed basis to meet liquidity needs 

table of contents the following table sets forth the maximum month end balance amount of the bank s outstanding short term borrowings during the years ended december   and  along with the average aggregate balances of the bank s outstanding short term borrowings for such periods during year ended december  dollars in thousands maximum balance at any month end during the period average balance weighted average interest rate the following table sets forth certain information as to short term borrowings at the dates indicated at december  dollars in thousands short term borrowings outstanding weighted average interest rate asset liability management 
the bank s earnings depend primarily upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on its interest earning assets  such as mortgage loans and investment securities  and its interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities  consisting of deposits and borrowings 
as market interest rates change  asset yields and liability costs do not change simultaneously 
due to maturity  re pricing and timing differences of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  earnings will be affected differently under various interest rate scenarios 
the bank has sought to limit these net income fluctuations and manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable rate loans and purchasing relatively short term and variable rate investments and securities 
the bank s interest rate spread is the principal determinant of the bank s net interest income 
the interest rate spread can vary considerably over time because asset and liability re pricing do not coincide 
moreover  the long term and cumulative effect of interest rate changes can be substantial 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of an institution s earnings and net asset values to changes in interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon sustaining a positive interest rate spread during fluctuations in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which either re price or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate re pricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which a financial institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a positive gap occurs when interest earning assets exceed interest bearing liabilities re pricing during a designated time frame 
conversely  a negative gap occurs when interest bearing liabilities exceed interest earning assets re pricing within a designated time frame 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income  and during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would have the opposite effect 
in recognition of the foregoing factors  the management and the board of directors of the bank have implemented an asset and liability management strategy directed toward maintaining a reasonable degree of interest rate sensitivity 
the principal elements of such strategy include i meeting the consumer preference for fixed rate loans over the past two years by establishing a correspondent lending program that has enabled the bank to originate and sell fixed rate mortgage loans  ii maintaining relatively short weighted average terms to maturity in the securities portfolio as a hedge against rising interest rates  iii emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate loans  and iv utilizing longer term certificates of deposit as funding sources when available 
management and the board of directors monitor the bank s exposure to interest rate risk on a monthly basis to ensure the interest rate risk is maintained within an acceptable range 
for more information on the bank s interest rate risk see the asset liability management and market risk section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which is scheduled to re price or mature in each of the time periods shown 
the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature in a given period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
the table shows that the maturity or re pricing of the bank s liabilities exceed the contractual terms to maturity or re pricing of the bank s earning assets in a twelve month period by million 
while this table based on contractual terms shows a negative gap  the bank s interest rate model which incorporates assumptions based on historical behavior shows a negative gap of million 
the difference is a result of the bank s interest rate model assumption that the balances in now and savings accounts react within a two year timeframe to market rate changes  rather than re pricing immediately 
these instruments are not tied to specific indices and are only influenced by market conditions and other factors 
the bank s experience with now and savings accounts has been that they have re priced at a pace equal to approximately of a prime change 
accordingly  a general movement in interest rates may not have any immediate effect on the rates paid on those deposit accounts

competition there is significant competition within the banking and financial services industry in northern kentucky  which is the primary market in which the bank operates 
changes in regulation  technology and product delivery systems have resulted in an increasingly competitive environment 
the bank expects to continue to face increasing competition from online and traditional financial institutions seeking to attract customers by providing access to similar services and products 
some of the institutions which compete with the bank are among the largest financial institutions in the united states 
any actual intervention or assistance to these competitors made by the us federal government  as well as the perception that such assistance would be forthcoming if needed  could have the effect of eroding any competitive advantages of the bank in the markets in which it operates 
within the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati ohio markets  the bank competes with approximately seven financial institutions with over billion in total assets  as well as numerous state chartered banking institutions of comparable or larger size and resources and smaller community banking organizations 
the bank also has numerous local  regional and national nonbank competitors  including savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage companies  insurance companies  
table of contents finance companies  financial service operations of major retailers  investment brokerage and financial advisory firms and mutual fund companies 
because nonbank financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies  they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 
currently  the bank does not face meaningful competition from international banks in its market  although that could change in the future 
the bank competes for deposits primarily with other commercial banks  savings associations and credit unions and with the issuers of commercial paper and other securities  such as shares in money market mutual funds 
the primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates and convenience of office locations 
the bank competes for making loans primarily with other banks  savings associations  consumer finance companies  credit unions  leasing companies and other nonbank competitors 
the bank competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and through the efficiency and quality of services it provides to borrowers 
competition for loans is affected by  among other things  the general availability of lendable funds  general and local economic conditions  current interest rate levels and other factors that are not readily predictable 
due to the bank s size relative to the many other financial institutions in its market  management believes that the bank does not have a substantial share of the deposit and loan markets 
the table below presents fdic deposit data regarding the bank s deposit market share 
the june data set forth below is the most current data available from the fdic at this time and represents those counties in which the bank has reported market share for deposits 
bank deposit market share in thousands market june deposits deposit market share boone county kentucky campbell county kentucky grant county kentucky kenton county kentucky source fdic services provided by the bank s trust division face competition from many national  regional and local financial institutions 
companies that offer broad services similar to those provided by the bank  such as other banks  trust companies and full service brokerage firms  as well as companies that specialize in particular services offered by the bank  such as investment advisors and mutual fund providers  all compete with the bank s trust division 
the bank s ability to compete effectively is a result of being able to provide customers with desired products and services in a convenient and cost effective manner 
customers for commercial  consumer and mortgage banking as well as trust services are influenced by convenience  quality of service  personal contacts  availability of products and services and related pricing 
the bank continually reviews its products  locations  alternative delivery channels  and pricing strategies to maintain and enhance its competitive position 
management believes it can compete effectively as a result of local market knowledge and awareness of  and attention to  customer needs 
employees as of december   the bank had full time employees and part time employees 
the bank believes that relations with its employees are good 
none of the employees of the bank are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents regulation and supervision the following discussion describes elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and banks and specific information about bkfc 
federal and state regulation of banks and their holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund  rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors 
regulation of bkfc 
bkfc is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb under the bank holding company act of  as amended bhca 
as a bank holding company  bkfc is required to file periodic reports with  and is subject to the regulation  supervision and examination by  the frb 
such examination by the frb determines whether bkfc is operating in accordance with various regulatory requirements and in a safe and sound manner 
the frb may initiate enforcement proceedings against bkfc for violations of laws or regulations or for engaging in unsafe and unsound practices  particularly if such conduct could or does adversely impact the bank 
bkfc is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  as administered by the sec 
under the bhca  the frb s prior approval is required in any case in which bkfc proposes to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank  or merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company 
the bhca also prohibits  with certain exceptions  bkfc from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of any class of voting shares of any non banking company 
under the bhca  bkfc may not engage in any business other than managing and controlling banks or furnishing certain specified services to subsidiaries and may not acquire voting control of non banking companies unless the frb determines such businesses and services to be closely related to banking 
when reviewing bank acquisition applications for approval  the frb considers  among other things  each subsidiary bank s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves in accordance with the community reinvestment act of  as amended the cra 
the bank has a current cra rating of satisfactory 
in addition  the frb could require that bkfc terminate any activity  if the frb deems the activity to constitute a serious risk to the financial soundness of the bank 
it is the policy of the frb that a bank holding company be ready and able to use its resources to provide capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
the frb could require bkfc to provide such support at times when bkfc lacks the resources to do so 
see regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions regarding minimum capital levels to which bkfc is subject and regulatory limits on bkfc s ability to pay dividends to stockholders 
as a bank holding company  bkfc must notify the frb if  during any one year period  it seeks to redeem shares of stock in an amount such that total redemptions during the year  net of sales of shares  would be greater than of bkfc s net worth 
regulation of the bank 
the bank is a kentucky chartered bank with fdic deposit insurance 
the bank is subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations regarding the conduct of its business  including  among other things maintenance of reserves against deposits  capital adequacy  restrictions on the nature and amount of loans which may be made and the interest which may be charged thereon  restrictions on the terms of loans to officers  directors  large shareholders and their affiliates  restrictions relating to investments and other activities  and requirements regarding mergers and branching activities 
the bank is subject to the regulation  supervision and examination by the kentucky department of financial institutions department and the fdic 
both the department and the fdic have the authority to issue cease and desist orders if either determines that the activities of the bank represent unsafe and unsound banking practices 
if the grounds provided by law exist  the department or the fdic may appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank 
state chartered banks  like the bank  are subject to regulatory oversight under various consumer protection and fair lending laws 
these laws govern  among other things  truth in lending disclosure  equal credit opportunity  fair credit reporting and community reinvestment 
failure to abide by federal laws and regulations governing community reinvestment could limit the ability of a state chartered bank to open a new branch or engage in a merger transaction 

table of contents the bank is subject to the guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending set forth by the office of the comptroller of the currency  the frb  and the fdic 
the guidance is intended to help ensure that institutions pursuing a significant commercial real estate lending strategy remain healthy and profitable while continuing to serve the credit needs of their communities 
also  this guidance directs institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations 
kentucky law limits loans or other extensions of credit to any borrower to of the bank s paid in capital and actual surplus 
such limit is increased to if the borrower provides good collateral security or executes to it a mortgage upon real or personal property with a cash value exceeding the amount of the loan 
loans or extensions of credit to certain borrowers are aggregated  and loans secured by certain government obligations are exempt from these limits 
at december   the maximum the bank could lend to any one borrower generally equaled million and equaled million if the borrower provided collateral with a cash value in excess of the amount of the loan 
federal banking laws and regulations also limit the transfer of funds or other items of value  including pursuant to the provision of loans  from banks to their affiliates 
generally  the bank s permissible activities and investments are prescribed by kentucky law 
however  state chartered banks  including the bank  may not  directly or through a subsidiary  engage in activities or make any investments as principal not permitted for a national bank  a bank holding company or a subsidiary of a nonmember bank  unless they obtain fdic approval 
emergency economic stabilization act of in response to recent unprecedented market turmoil  the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was enacted on october  the eesa authorizes the secretary of the united states department of the treasury the secretary to purchase or guarantee up to billion in troubled assets from financial institutions under the tarp 
pursuant to authority granted under the eesa  the secretary has created the tarp cpp under which the treasury department will invest up to billion in senior preferred stock of us banks and savings associations or their holding companies 
qualifying financial institutions may issue senior preferred stock with a value equal to not less than of risk weighted assets and not more than the lesser of billion or of risk weighted assets 
institutions participating in the tarp or cpp are required to issue warrants for common or preferred stock or senior debt to the secretary 
if an institution participates in the cpp or if the secretary acquires a meaningful equity or debt position in the institution as a result of tarp participation  the institution is required to meet certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance  including a prohibition against incentives to take unnecessary and excessive risks  recovery of bonuses paid to senior executives based on materially inaccurate earnings or other statements and a prohibition against agreements for the payment of golden parachutes 
institutions that sell more than million in assets under tarp auctions or participate in the cpp will not be entitled to a tax deduction for compensation in excess of  paid to its chief executive or chief financial official or any of its other three most highly compensated officers 
in addition  any severance paid to such officers for involuntary termination or termination in connection with a bankruptcy or receivership will be subject to the golden parachute rules under the internal revenue code 
additional standards with respect to executive compensation and corporate governance for institutions that have participated or will participate in the tarp including the cpp were enacted as part of the arra  described below 
cpp participation 
on february   bkfc entered into a letter agreement the purchase agreement with the treasury department under the cpp  pursuant to which bkfc agreed to issue  shares of the series a preferred stock  having a liquidation amount per share equal to  for a total price of million 
the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per year 
under the arra  bkfc may redeem the series a preferred stock subject to the approval of the treasury department and its primary federal regulator 
bkfc may  at its option  redeem the series a preferred stock at par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock is generally non voting  but does have the right to vote as a class on the issuance of any preferred stock ranking senior  any change in its terms or any merger  exchange or similar transaction that would adversely affect its rights 
the holder s of series a preferred stock also have the right to elect two directors if dividends have not been paid for six periods 

table of contents as part of its purchase of the series a preferred stock  the treasury department received the warrant to purchase  shares of bkfc common stock  at an initial per share exercise price of 
the warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of bkfc s common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions  such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of bkfc s common stock  and upon certain issuances of bkfc s common stock at or below a specified price relative to the initial exercise price 
the warrant expires years from the issuance date 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the treasury department has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrant 
under the arra  the warrant would be liquidated upon the redemption by bkfc of the series a preferred stock 
both the series a preferred stock and the warrant will be accounted for as components of tier capital  as further described below 
prior to february   unless bkfc has redeemed the series a preferred stock or the treasury department has transferred the series a preferred stock to a third party  the consent of the treasury department will be required for bkfc to declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on its common stock other than regular semiannual cash dividends of not more than per share of common stock or redeem  purchase or acquire any shares of its common stock or other equity or capital securities  other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the purchase agreement 
american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra was enacted on february  the arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health and education needs 
in addition  the arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate governance obligations on all current and future tarp recipients  including bkfc  until the institution has redeemed the preferred stock  which tarp recipients are now permitted to do under the arra without regard to the three year holding period and without the need to raise new capital  subject to approval of its primary federal regulator 
the executive compensation restrictions under the arra described below are more stringent than those currently in effect under the cpp  but it is yet unclear how these executive compensation standards will relate to the similar standards recently announced by the treasury department  or whether the standards will be considered effective immediately or only after implementing regulations are issued by the treasury department 
the arra amends section of the eesa to require the secretary to adopt additional standards with respect to executive compensation and corporate governance for tarp recipients including bkfc 
the standards required to be established by the secretary include  in part i prohibitions on making golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and the next most highly compensated employees during such time as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the tarp remains outstanding the restricted period  ii prohibitions on paying or accruing bonuses or other incentive awards for certain senior executive officers and employees  except for awards of long term restricted stock with a value equal to no greater than of the subject employee s annual compensation that do not fully vest during the restricted period or unless such compensation is pursuant to a valid written employment contract prior to february   ii requirements that cpp participants provide for the recovery of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to the most highly compensated employees based on statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria later found to be materially inaccurate  with the secretary having authority to negotiate for reimbursement  and iv a review by the secretary of all bonuses and other compensation paid by tarp participants to senior executive employees and the next most highly compensated employees before the date of enactment of the arra to determine whether such payments were inconsistent with the purposes of the act 
the arra also sets forth additional corporate governance obligations for tarp recipients  including requirements for the secretary to establish standards that provide for semi annual meetings of compensation committees of the board of directors to discuss and evaluate employee compensation plans in light of an assessment of any risk posed from such compensation plans 
tarp recipients are further required by the arra to have in place company wide policies regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  permit non binding shareholder say on pay proposals to be included in proxy materials  as well as require written certifications by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer with respect to compliance 
on june   the secretary promulgated regulations to implement the executive compensation and certain corporate governance provisions detailed in the arra

table of contents regulatory capital requirements 
the frb has adopted risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
such companies must maintain adequate consolidated capital to meet the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit the risk based ratio of 
at least half of the minimum required total capital of must be composed of tier capital  which consists of common shareholders equity  minority interests in the equity of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier risk based ratio 
the remainder of total capital may consist of subordinated and qualifying convertible debt  other preferred stock and a limited amount of loan and lease loss allowances 
the frb has also established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
the guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total assets excluding the loan and lease loss allowance  goodwill and certain other intangibles  and portions of certain nonfinancial equity investments the leverage ratio of for bank holding companies that meet specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating 
all other bank holding companies must maintain a leverage ratio of to 
the guidelines further provide that bank holding companies making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels 
the bank is subject to similar capital requirements  and such capital requirements are imposed and enforced by the fdic 
the following table sets forth the tier risk based ratio  total risk based ratio and leverage ratio for bkfc and the bank at december  at december bkfc bank amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands tier risk based requirement excess total risk based requirement excess leverage ratio requirement excess the fdic may require an increase in a bank s risk based capital requirements on an individualized basis to address the bank s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to a change in interest rates  among other things 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
the fdic has adopted regulations governing prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of capital deficient and otherwise troubled banks under its regulation 
for these purposes  the law establishes three categories of capital deficient institutions undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
at each successively lower defined capital category  an institution is subject to more restrictive and numerous mandatory or discretionary regulatory actions or limits  and the fdic has less flexibility in determining how to resolve the problems of the institution 
the fdic generally can downgrade an institution s capital category  notwithstanding its capital level  if  after notice and opportunity for hearing  the institution is deemed to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice because it has not corrected deficiencies that resulted in it receiving a less than satisfactory examination rating on matters other than capital or it is deemed to be in an unsafe or unsound condition 
an undercapitalized institution must submit a capital restoration 
table of contents plan to the fdic within days after it becomes undercapitalized 
such institution will be subject to increased monitoring and asset growth restrictions and will be required to obtain prior approval for acquisitions  branching and engaging in new lines of business 
furthermore  critically undercapitalized institutions must be placed in conservatorship or receivership within days of reaching that capitalization level  except under limited circumstances 
at year end the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category 
the fdic has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation 
an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater 
an institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and generally a leverage ratio of or greater 
an institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or generally a leverage ratio of less than or less for institutions with the highest examination rating 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than 
an institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity as defined in the regulations to total assets that is equal to or less than 
the bank s capital levels at december  met the standards for the highest level  a well capitalized institution 
federal law prohibits a financial institution from making a capital distribution to anyone or paying management fees to any person having control of the institution if  after such distribution or payment  the institution would be undercapitalized 
in addition  each holding company controlling an undercapitalized institution must guarantee that the institution will comply with its capital restoration plan until the institution has been adequately capitalized on an average during each of the four preceding calendar quarters and must provide adequate assurances of performance 
the aggregate liability pursuant to such guarantee is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to of the institution s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable to such institution at the time the institution fails to comply with its capital restoration plan 
dividend restrictions 
there are a number of statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies 
please see note of the financial statements for a discussion on the bank s current dividend restrictions 
as part of the cpp program  any increase in bkfc s dividend level from the september semi annual payment of 
per share must be approved by the treasury department 
if the frb or the fdic determines that a bank holding company or a bank is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the entity  could include the payment of dividends  that regulator may require  after notice and hearing  that such bank holding company or bank cease and desist from such practice 
in addition  the frb and the fdic have issued policy statements  which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings 
the fdic prohibits the payment of any dividend by a bank that would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
compliance with the minimum capital requirements limits the amounts that bkfc and the bank can pay as dividends 
in  bkfc paid a cash dividend of per share totaling approximately million on common shares and cash dividends on the preferred shares of million 
fdic deposit insurance and assessments 
the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures deposits  up to prescribed statutory limits  of federally insured banks and thrifts and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries 
the bank s deposits are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic the dif 
the dif is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in the fdic amended its risk based assessment system for to implement authority granted by the federal deposit insurance reform act of under the revised system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
risk category i  which 
table of contents contains the least risky depository institutions  is expected to include of all institutions 
unlike the other categories  risk category i contains further risk differentiation based on the fdic s analysis of financial ratios  examination component ratings and other information 
in october  the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage of interest bearing transaction accounts increased from  to  per depositor under the eesa 
in november  the fdic offered a voluntary expanded insurance program to depository institutions  which provides  without charge to depositors  full guarantee on all non interest bearing transaction accounts held by any depositor  regardless of dollar amount 
the bank participates in this program 
the fdic maintains the dif by assessing each depository institution an insurance premium 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by a dif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by a company s fdic supervisory rating  and other various measures  such as the level of brokered deposits  unsecured debt  and debt issuer ratings 
on september   the fdic adopted an amended restoration plan to allow the deposit insurance fund to return to a reserve ratio of within eight years  as mandated by statute 
as part of the amended restoration plan  the fdic amended its assessment regulations to require all institutions to prepay on december  their estimated risk based insurance assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of  and at that same time  institutions were also required to pay their regular quarterly assessments for the third quarter of an institution s quarterly risk based deposit insurance assessments thereafter would be paid from the amount the institution prepaid until that amount was exhausted or until december   when any amount remaining would be returned to the institution 
the prepaid assessment amount was million on december  the dif assessment rate currently ranges from to per of domestic deposits 
effective april   the fdic has proposed an assessment rate range of to basis points for institutions that do not exceed a certain threshold amount of brokered deposits and secured liabilities  and higher rates for those that do exceed the threshold amount 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule from one quarter to the next 
an increase in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on bkfc s earnings  depending on the amount of the increase 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound  or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank could have a material adverse effect on bkfc s earnings 
frb reserve requirements 
frb regulations currently require banks to maintain reserves of of net transaction accounts primarily demand and now accounts up to million of such accounts subject to an exemption of up to million  and of of net transaction accounts in excess of million 
at december   the bank was in compliance with this reserve requirement  which was  acquisitions of control

item a 
risk factors an investment in the common stock of bkfc is subject to certain risks inherent in the business of bkfc and the bank 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect bkfc and the bank are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference into this form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing bkfc or the bank 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the business operations of bkfc or the bank 
this form k is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 

table of contents if any of the following risks occur  or if any combination of the following risks occur  the financial condition and results of operations of bkfc or the bank could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of bkfc s common stock could decline significantly 
references to we  us  and our in this risk factors section refer to bkfc and its subsidiaries  including the bank  unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires 
our business depends upon the general economic conditions of the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati ohio area  and may continue to be adversely affected by downturns in the local economies in which we operate 
our business operations are limited almost exclusively to the northern kentucky and the greater cincinnati  ohio area  which is a small geographic area 
as such  our business is closely tied to the general economic conditions of this area 
local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services  as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the bank s deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions could increase loan delinquencies  increase problem assets and foreclosure  increase claims and lawsuits  decrease the demand for the bank s products and services  or decrease the value of collateral for loans  especially real estate  in turn reducing customers borrowing power and the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage  thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate and concentrated in the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati area  which may adversely effect our earnings and capital if real estate values decline 
nearly of our total loans are real estate interests residential  nonresidential including both owner occupied and investment real estate  and construction and land development concentrated in the northern kentucky area and neighboring areas in greater cincinnati  ohio  a small geographic area 
as a result  declining real estate values in the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati  ohio markets as a result of the ongoing national economic recession could negatively impact the value of the real estate collateral securing such loans 
if we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values in satisfaction of any nonperforming or defaulted loans  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
we are subject to intense competition in our market area  and our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively 
bkfc and its subsidiaries compete with national financial institutions  as well as numerous state chartered banking institutions of comparable or larger size and resources  smaller community banking organizations and a variety of nonbank competitors 
the bank competes for deposits with other commercial banks  savings associations and credit unions and with the issuers of commercial paper and other securities  such as shares in money market mutual funds 
in making loans  the bank competes with other banks  savings associations  consumer finance companies  credit unions  leasing companies and other lenders 
many of the institutions against whom we compete are national and regional banks that are significantly larger than us and  therefore  have significantly greater resources and the ability to achieve economies of scale by offering a broader range of products and services at more competitive prices than we can offer 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
our ability to compete successfully and to maintain and grow our profitability depends upon a number of factors  including the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to continue to expand bkfc s market position through organic growth and strategic acquisitions  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which bkfc introduces new products and services relative to our competitors  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents our nonresidential real estate loans expose us to greater risks of nonpayment and loss than residential mortgage loans  which may cause us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
at december   million  or  of our loan portfolio consisted of nonresidential real estate loans 
nonresidential real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers 
such loans expose us to additional risks because they typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower s business and are secured by collateral that may depreciate over time 
these loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential mortgage loans 
because such loans generally entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans 
also  many of our nonresidential real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan 
we may require access to the capital and credit markets to conduct our business operations  and the unprecedented levels of volatility that have impacted such capital and credit markets could impair our access to the same 
during and  the capital and credit markets experienced extended volatility and disruption 
in the third quarter of  the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if these levels of market disruption and volatility continue  worsen or abate and then arise at a later date  bkfc s ability to access capital could be materially impaired 
bkfc s inability to access the capital markets could constrain our ability to make new loans  to meet our existing lending commitments and  ultimately  jeopardize our overall liquidity and capitalization 
in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets and the potential threats to the solvency of investment banks and other financial institutions  the us government has taken unprecedented actions 
these actions include the government assisted acquisition of bear stearns by jpmorgan chase  the federal conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac  and the plan of treasury department to inject capital and to purchase mortgage loans and mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets or particular financial institutions 
investors should not assume that these governmental actions will necessarily benefit the financial markets in general  or bkfc in particular 
bkfc could also be adversely impacted if one or more of its direct competitors are beneficiaries of selective governmental interventions such as fdic assisted transactions and bkfc does not receive comparable assistance 
further  investors should not assume that the government will continue to intervene in the financial markets at all 
investors should be aware that governmental intervention or the lack thereof could materially and adversely affect bkfc s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ongoing national economic recession could require further additions to our allowance for loan losses  which would reduce our net income 
if our borrowers do not repay their loans or if the collateral securing their loans is insufficient to provide for the full repayment  we may suffer credit losses 
credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors 
if our assumptions and judgments are wrong  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover our losses 
if we determine that our allowance for loan losses is insufficient  we would be required to take additional provisions for loan losses  which would reduce net income during the period those provisions are taken 
in addition  our regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or to charge off particular loans 
the ongoing national economic recession  and its impact upon the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati  ohio markets where our business is concentrated  has caused us to continue to increase our allowance for loan losses 
if current economic trends continue  bkfc may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses  resulting in bkfc further increasing its provisions for loan losses in the future and reduced net income 

table of contents our accounting policies and estimates are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations  and any changes to such accounting policies and estimates could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting policies and estimates are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
our management makes judgments and assumptions in selecting and adopting various accounting policies and in applying estimates so that such policies and estimates comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  valuing an asset or liability or reducing a liability 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently 
in addition  these policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters  actual outcomes may be materially different from amounts previously estimated 
for example  because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates  management cannot provide any assurance that the bank will not significantly increase its allowance for loan losses if actual losses are more than the amount reserved 
any increase in its allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior financial statements 
see allowance for loan losses under item business and critical accounting policies under item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies 
further  from time to time  the financial accounting standards board and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
the ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by legislators and our regulators  particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles 
in addition  ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between gaap and international financial reporting standards may result in changes to gaap 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in our restating prior period financial statements or otherwise adversely effecting our financial condition or results of operation 
our largest source of revenue net interest income is subject to interest rate risk 
the bank s financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
the bank s earnings depend primarily upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and its interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities  consisting of deposits and borrowings 
moreover  the loans included in our interest earning assets are primarily comprised of variable and adjustable rate loans 
net interest income is subject to interest rate risk in the following ways in general  for a given change in interest rates  the amount of change in value positive or negative is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities 
the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields  funding costs and investment income differently 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates decline sharply  loans may pre pay  or pay down  faster than anticipated  thus reducing future cash flows and interest income 
conversely  if interest rates increase  depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to maturity notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives 

table of contents repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times 
for example  in a falling rate environment  if assets re price faster than liabilities  there will be an initial decline in earnings 
moreover  if assets and liabilities re price at the same time  they may not be by the same increment 
for instance  if the federal funds rate increased fifty basis points  rates on demand deposits may rise by basis points  whereas rates on prime based loans will instantly rise basis points 
financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates 
this causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes to net interest income  net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
therefore  bkfc s management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts bkfc s funding strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on bkfc s balance sheet 
the bank s asset and liability management strategies designed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest rate sensitivity are more fully described in asset liability management under item business and asset liability management and market risk under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future to address the current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry may significantly affect bkfc s financial condition  results of operation  liquidity or stock price 
the eesa  which established the tarp  was enacted on october  as part of the tarp  the treasury department created the cpp  under which the treasury department will invest up to billion in senior preferred stock of us banks and savings associations or their holding companies for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on february   the arra was enacted as a sweeping economic recovery package intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health and education needs 
there can be no assurance as to the actual impact that the eesa or its programs  including the cpp  and arra or its programs  will have on the national economy or financial markets 
the failure of these significant legislative measures to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect bkfc s financial condition  results of operation  liquidity or stock price 
in addition  there have been numerous actions undertaken in connection with or following the eesa and arra by the frb  congress  the treasury department  the fdic  the sec and others in efforts to address the current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry that followed the sub prime mortgage market meltdown which began in late these measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  a mandatory stress test requirement for banking institutions with assets in excess of billion to analyze capital sufficiency and risk exposure  and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
the purpose of these legislative and regulatory actions is to help stabilize the us banking system 
however  the eesa  the arra and any current or future legislative or regulatory initiatives may not have their desired effect  or may have an adverse effect when applied to bkfc 
failure to meet any of the various capital adequacy guidelines which we are subject to could adversely effect our operations and could compromise the status of bkfc as a bank holding company 
bkfc and the bank are required to meet certain regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements imposed by the frb  the fdic and the department 
if bkfc or the bank fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and could compromise the status of bkfc as a banking holding company 
see regulatory capital requirements under item business for detailed capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks 

table of contents bkfc is subject to liquidity risk  which could disrupt our ability to meet our financial obligations 
liquidity refers to the availability of bkfc to ensure sufficient levels of cash to fund operations  such as meeting deposit withdrawals  funding loan commitments  paying expenses and meeting quarterly payment obligations under certain subordinated debentures issued by bkfc in connection with the issuance of floating rate redeemable trust preferred securities issued by bkfc s unconsolidated trust subsidiary 
the source of the funds for bkfc s debt obligations is dependent on the bank 
if needed  the bank has the ability to borrow term and overnight funds from the fhlb or other financial intermediaries 
the bank also has million of securities designated as available for sale that can serve as sources of funds 
in addition  in february bkfc issued million of series a preferred stock to the treasury department as part of the cpp  resulting in additional cash available to support the bank s capital position 
while management is satisfied that bkfc s liquidity is sufficient at december  to meet known and potential obligations  any significant restriction or disruption of bkfc s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on bkfc s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations  which could materially affect bkfc s financial condition 
bkfc is a bank holding company  and its sources of funds are limited 
bkfc is a bank holding company and its operations are primarily conducted by the bank  which is subject to significant federal and state regulation 
cash available to pay dividends to stockholders of bkfc is derived primarily  from dividends paid by the bank 
as a result  bkfc s ability to receive dividends or loans from its subsidiaries is restricted 
under federal law  the payment of dividends by the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements 
the frb and or the fdic prohibit a dividend payment by bkfc or the bank that would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
see dividend restrictions under item business 
the inability of the bank to generate profits and pay such dividends to bkfc  or regulator restrictions on the payment of such dividends to bkfc even if earned  would have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of bkfc and bkfc s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
in addition  since bkfc is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank  its right to participate in the distribution of assets of the bank upon the bank s liquidation  reorganization or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of the bank s creditors  which will generally take priority over the bank s shareholders 
our stock price can be volatile 
our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors  making it more difficult for you to resell your bkfc common stock at prices you find attractive and at the time you want 
factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in recommendations or projections by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies deemed to be peers  news reports and perception in the marketplace regarding bkfc  our competitors and or the financial services industry as a whole  results of litigation  significant acquisitions or business combinations involving bkfc or our competitors  and other factors  including those described in this risk factors section 
for example  the existence of the warrant to purchase up to  shares of bkfc common stock at an exercise price of per share and the potential for dilution or actual dilution the warrant may cause  as described in detail below  may create volatility in the market price of bkfc s common stock 
in addition  our common stock also has a low average daily trading volume  which limits a person s ability to quickly accumulate or quickly divest themselves of large blocks of our stock 
further  a low average trading volume can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded 
recent or future acquisitions by bkfc may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties 
bkfc regularly explores opportunities to acquire financial services businesses or assets and may also consider opportunities to acquire other banks or financial institutions 
in  we acquired fnb bancorporation 
in 
table of contents  we acquired certain banking offices and assumed certain deposit liabilities of integra bank  as well as adding the investment professionals of tapke asset management  llc to the bank s trust department 
difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company such as those described above or other businesses we acquire in the future may cause bkfc not to realize expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence and or other projected benefits 
the integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition run off  loss of key employees  disruption of bkfc s business or the business of the acquired company  or otherwise adversely affect bkfc s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
also  the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected 
the treasury department s investment in bkfc imposes restrictions and obligations limiting bkfc s ability to increase dividends  repurchase common stock or preferred stock and access the equity capital markets 
unless bkfc has redeemed all of the series a preferred stock issued to the treasury department as part of the cpp  or unless the treasury department has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to a third party  the consent of the treasury department will be required for bkfc to  among other things  increase common stock dividends or effect repurchases of common stock with certain exceptions 
bkfc has also granted registration rights to the treasury department pursuant to which bkfc has agreed to lock up periods prior to and following the effective date of an underwritten offering of the preferred stock  the warrant or the underlying common stock held by the treasury department  during such time when bkfc would be unable to issue equity securities 
the treasury department s investment in bkfc may dilute earnings  encumbers earnings to pay preferred dividends and requires bkfc to accrue the related discount through earnings 
full exercise of the warrant issued to the treasury department as part of the cpp will dilute bkfc s common shareholders by approximately  based upon the approximately  shares of bkfc s common stock issued and outstanding as of march  should the market value of bkfc s common stock increase above the exercise price of per common share prior to the exercise of the warrant  accounting rules will require additional shares to be included in the fully diluted share count  and will effectively reduce reported diluted earnings per share to common shareholders 
if the warrant is exercised  dividends would become payable with respect to the newly issued shares 
likewise  in a scenario in which bkfc s management might prefer to repurchase the warrant  if the market price of the common stock is significantly above the exercise price of the warrant  the value of the warrant would rise with the market price of the common stock 
in such a scenario  a higher amount of cash would be needed to repurchase the warrant  reducing capital surplus 
furthermore  a scenario involving early redemption of the series a preferred stock issued to the treasury department will require the acceleration of the associated discount through earnings available for common shareholders 
if not redeemed by february   the annual dividend payments on the preferred stock will increase from per annum to per annum 
if bkfc is unable to redeem the preferred stock at or prior to february   then this higher dividend rate may be financially unattractive to bkfc relative to the cost of capital under the market conditions prevailing after that date 
in addition  bkfc is required by accounting rules to accrete the deemed discount on the preferred stock issued to the treasury department through earnings available to common shareholders 
the discount will accrete through february  at an amount of approximately  annually  reducing earnings available to common shareholders 
if the preferred stock is redeemed early by bkfc  accretion of the remaining discount will be accelerated through earnings available to common shareholders at that time 
any future fdic premiums or special assessments will adversely impact our earnings 
on may   the fdic adopted a final rule levying a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus tier capital as of june  bkfc recorded an expense of  for the fiscal year ended december   to reflect the special assessment 
the final rule permits the fdic to levy up to two additional special assessments of up to five basis points each during if the fdic estimates that the dif reserve ratio will fall to a level that the fdic believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a level that will be close to or below zero 
any further special assessments that the fdic levies 
table of contents will be recorded as an expense during the appropriate period 
in addition  the fdic increased the general assessment rate and  therefore  our fdic general insurance premium expense will increase compared to prior periods 
on november   the fdic adopted regulations that require insured depository institutions to prepay on december  their estimated assessments for the fourth calendar quarter of  and for all of  and the new regulations base the assessment rate for the fourth calendar quarter of and for on each institution s total base assessment rate for the third quarter of  modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on september  had been in effect for the entire third quarter  and the assessment rate for and on the modified third quarter assessment base  adjusted quarterly for an estimated annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of under the prepaid assessment rule  we were required to make a payment of approximately million to the fdic on december   and to record the payment as a prepaid expense  which will be amortized to expense over three years

management overview the business of bkfc consists of holding and administering its interest in the bank 
the bank conducts basic banking operations from locations in boone  kenton  campbell  grant and gallatin counties in northern kentucky and also in greater cincinnati  ohio 
the majority of bkfc s revenue is derived from the bank s loan portfolio 
the loan portfolio is diversified and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans is not dependent upon any single industry 
commercial or residential real estate or other business and consumer assets secure the majority of the bank s loans 
the national economy in faced numerous challenging conditions 
the economy was in recession and experienced rising unemployment  declining real estate values and high volatility in the equity markets 
as a result  consumer confidence and spending declined and asset values dropped 
the capital and earnings levels of the nation s banks fell  and over one hundred forty financial institutions failed 
during  bkfc participated in the treasury department s cpp program 
although the bank and bkfc s capital ratios exceeded the minimum levels required for it to be ranked well capitalized  management decided to participate in the program 
the treasury department s investment was received in february of management decided to participate in the cpp program to reinforce its strong capital position  advance the treasury department s efforts to facilitate additional lending in the markets in which the bank operates  maintain its competitive advantage over its less well capitalized competitors  ensure sufficient capital to support future acquisitions and support its general operations 
for additional information see capital purchase program below 
although bkfc experienced an increase in defaults and foreclosures in fiscal  the levels have been significantly less than other regions of the country 
this is due  in part  to the fact that bkfc s market in northern kentucky and cincinnati did not experience as dramatic a rise in real estate values over the last several years as compared to markets in florida and california 
while bkfc s local markets have not been affected as severely as other markets  with the majority of the loan portfolio being real estate related  management continues to closely monitor developments in the real estate market 
while the amount of resources devoted to the credit review function and working out problem loans increased significantly during  bkfc did not make significant changes to its loan underwriting standards 
bkfc s willingness to make loans to qualified applicants that meet its traditional  prudent lending standards has not changed 

table of contents as discussed above  the biggest factor affecting the financial results was the current deep economic recession facing the country and the region 
particularly  high unemployment and falling real estate values have placed significant economic strain on a majority of the bank s business partners 
the bank s loan portfolio has been most significantly affected by economic conditions 
the credit quality metrics of the bank s loan portfolio in showed the strain of these economic conditions  with charge offs and nonperforming loans more than doubling 
charge offs increased from  in to  in while nonperforming loans rose from  at the end of to  at the end of these falling credit quality metrics led the bank to provide  in the provision for loans losses in versus  in as a result the allowance for loan losses rose from  at december  to  at december  to be directionally consistent with the economic strains on the loan portfolio 
management sees these economic strains continuing into and expects continuing higher than normal credit losses and provisioning expense in the foreseeable future 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the bank did experience in significant balance sheet growth and a growing customer base  leading to an increase in total revenue from  in to  in  which management viewed as a success given the current economic conditions 
overhead expense remained relatively stable  despite a significant increase in fdic insurance expense 
this revenue increase included a  or  increase in net interest income and a  or  increase in non interest income 
excluding the  or  increase in fdic insurance  total non interest expense increased only  or from to as discussed above  in the bank participated in the cpp  and accepted a  investment in the bank 
bkfc chose to participate in the cpp in order to reinforce its strong capital position  advance the treasury department s efforts to facilitate additional lending in the markets in which the bank operates  maintain its competitive advantage over its less well capitalized competitors  ensure sufficient capital to support future acquisitions and support its general operations 
participation in this program was encouraged by our main regulators 
see capital purchase program below for additional details 
the bank also completed two acquisitions in on december   the bank completed the purchase of three banking offices of integra bank and a portfolio of selected commercial loans originated by integra bank s covington  kentucky loan production office 
this acquisition was consistent with the bank s strategy to strengthen and expand its northern kentucky market share 
on december   the bank completed the purchase of tapke asset management  llc  an independent investment advisory firm  headquartered in fort wright  kentucky 
this acquisition was consistent with the bank s strategy to strengthen and grow the trust department revenue  diversify the bank s revenues and to give the bank s current customers access to more products and services backed by a team of investment professionals 
please see note of the financial statements for more detail on these acquisitions the following sections provide more detail on subjects presented in the overview 
capital purchase program on february   bkfc entered into the purchase agreement with the treasury department under the cpp  pursuant to which bkfc agreed to issue  shares of series a preferred stock  for a total price of million 
the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per year 
the series a preferred stock and the warrant were issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to section of the securities act of bkfc is further required pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement to register the resale of the series a preferred stock  the warrant and the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrant with the sec 
the warrant has been exercisable since february   its date of issuance bkfc chose to participate in the cpp in order to reinforce its strong capital position  advance the treasury department s efforts to facilitate additional lending in the markets in which the bank operates  maintain its competitive advantage over its less well capitalized competitors  ensure sufficient capital to support future acquisitions and support its general operations 
bkfc s decision to participate in the cpp was also affected by 
table of contents discussions with its regulators  including the fdic and the federal reserve bank of cleveland 
in light of the turmoil in the banking sector  uncertainty as to government action in the future with respect to risk based capital guidelines  as well as the general economy as a whole  bkfc elected to request the maximum amount available for investment by the treasury department under the cpp of the bank s risk weighted assets for the reasons described above 
at present bkfc is considering all alternatives associated with raising additional capital necessary to support a repurchase of the series a preferred stock  which management may consider undertaking at some point during  depending on market conditions and after further discussion with bkfc and the bank s regulators 
use of capital the cpp funds have not been segregated from bkfc s other funds  and thus those funds cannot be directly traced through bkfc s balance sheet 
based on analysis of the market conditions at the time of issuance  bkfc determined that the proceeds of the treasury department s investment in its series a preferred stock initially would be best deployed in us government agency mbs until loan demand improved 
bkfc retained million of the proceeds to extinguish short term debt and further augment its capital position  and invested the remaining million in the bank 
in turn  the bank invested the million of the proceeds  along with other funds obtained  to leverage the cpp investment  in mbs pending deployment in more permanent uses such as for acquisitions and to support loan growth 
with these investments  bkfc provided incremental liquidity to the residential mortgage markets and at the same time obtained products that generate cash flow 
bkfc is holding the mbs assets on its balance sheet as available for sale 
bkfc intends to utilize its cash flows  including those derived from its mbs investments and the proceeds of any sale or disposition of its mbs investments  to fund commercial and residential loans that meet bkfc s long standing prudent lending standards as the demand for high quality loans rises in the markets it serves and otherwise support its business 
bkfc is committed to making credit available to the markets it serves and fulfilling the needs of its customers 
to ensure that all lending growth opportunities are addressed  the bank in implemented a new loan committee structure  adding the bank s chief executive officer to the bank s loan committee to further scrutinize credit decisions 
additionally  the bank established a problem asset workout group in in addition to managing distressed assets  this group provides advice and support for the bank s lending professionals with respect to those relationships that are showing signs of stress  but have not elevated to the point of transfer to workout  to address the needs of existing clients 
in certain sectors  such as commercial lending  loan demand has diminished  consistent with the overall economy  as customers have taken a conservative direction and postponed investments 
conversely  residential mortgage activity increased in in response to favorable interest rates and new government agency programs 
while the cpp funds have not been segregated  and this increased lending is not directly traceable in a dollar for dollar manner to the cpp  the cpp investment has strengthened bkfc s balance sheet and capital position 
in addition  bkfc has not experienced the level of stress or deterioration in its residential real estate portfolio that other financial institutions may be experiencing  and the bank has not created or marketed to its customers any sub prime loan products  does not service mortgages for other institutions and otherwise follows a strategy in selling the majority of the bank s residential loans into the secondary market 
in the majority of situations  the bank follows the underwriting guidelines of the various government agencies on loans the bank seeks to portfolio 
for the year ended december   the bank s residential real estate loan production was million 
of this  sold loans totaled million  while portfolio and construction loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the average balance of amortizing portfolio loans during was million as compared to million in residential real estate charge offs in this portfolio in and were 
and 
respectively 
delinquencies have been moderate  and non accruals were million as of december  versus million outstanding amortizing portfolio loan balances  or 
the bank had residential loans on non accrual as of december   with two of those loans totaling million  or of aggregate non accrual loan balances 
these statistics are a result of the bank s underwriting and collection practices 
the bank has also added full time equivalent resources to its collections department  allowing the bank to make more frequent and earlier collection calls  resulting in better working relationships with those borrowers who may have difficulty in making timely payments 

table of contents effects of cpp participation the terms of the series a preferred stock provide that  in the event bkfc defaults on the payment of dividends due on the series a preferred stock for an aggregate of six quarters or more  the board of directors of bkfc shall be automatically increased by two positions  and the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have the right to elect two directors to fill those positions 
bkfc did not need to amend its bylaws to increase the maximum size of the board of directors in order to accommodate an election of those two directors 
bkfc did not have any other senior class of securities outstanding at the time it entered into the purchase agreement 
with respect to bkfc s day to day operations  participation in the cpp heightened the focus on originating new loans that meet the bank s prudent lending standards and strengthened bkfc s capital ratios 
for example  at december  prior to the cpp transaction  bkfc s ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets were  and  respectively  and at march  following the february  cpp transaction the bkfc s ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets were  and  respectively 
however  it should be noted that  prior to bkfc s participation in the cpp  both it and the bank were well capitalized 
at december   each of the bank s ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets exceeded the respective ratios of  and  which are the minimum ratios of regulatory capital required to be well capitalized 
bkfc s participation in the cpp has affected the income available to common stockholders in two ways i bkfc agreed in the purchase agreement to not pay any dividend on the common stock prior to february  other than regular quarterly cash dividends of not more than per share of common stock  and ii the dividend payments which are due on the series a preferred stock have the effect of reducing the net income otherwise available to the common stockholders 
the terms of the purchase agreement prohibit repurchases of common stock although there was no intent  at the time of the issuance of the series a preferred stock  for bkfc to buy back or otherwise repurchase any of its common stock 
bkfc has complied and will continue to comply with the executive compensation and corporate governance requirements of each of the eesa  the arra and any subsequent legislation  regulations or guidance for so long as the series a preferred stock or any other security acquired under the purchase agreement is held by the treasury department 
as required by the eesa and arra  bkfc will further limit the section m tax deduction for executive compensation to  per year for any senior executive officer for so long as the series a preferred stock or any other security acquired under the purchase agreement is held by the treasury department 
an executive compensation risk assessment was performed by bkfc s senior risk officers 
based on the materials reviewed  bkfc s senior risk officers concluded that the executive compensation and incentive program as then in effect did not encourage the senior executive officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks 
the findings of this risk assessment were presented to the compensation committee of the board and final conclusions were provided to the full board 
a certification statement will be included within the compensation committee report of the bkfc proxy statement 
this risk assessment will occur each year in which the series a preferred stock or any other security acquired under the purchase agreement is held by the treasury department 
in addition  the compensation committee  which is composed entirely of independent directors  will discuss bkfc s compensation arrangements in light of such risk assessment at least semi annually for so long as the series a preferred stock or any other security acquired under the securities purchase agreement is held by the treasury department 
bkfc s proxy statement will permit a nonbinding shareholder vote to provide advisory approval of the compensation of bkfc s executives 
critical accounting policies bkfc has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this report in accordance with gaap 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  bkfc makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents we have identified the accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses as critical to the understanding of bkfc s results of operations  since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in reporting materially different amounts if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
the bank maintains an allowance to absorb probable  incurred loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the bank considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans 
loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are based on the bank s review of its historical loan loss experience and such factors that  in management s judgment  deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable loan losses 
the bank s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of well defined credit policies  uniform underwriting criteria  and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures 
the credit risk management strategy also includes assessments of compliance with commercial and consumer policies  risk ratings and other important credit information 
the strategy also emphasizes regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration in credit quality 
the bank strives to identify potential problem loans early and promptly undertake the appropriate actions necessary to mitigate or eliminate the increasing risk identified in these loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two components  the specific reserve  pursuant to asc  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and the general reserve  pursuant to asc  accounting for contingencies 
impaired loans are those that management has determined it is probable the customer will be unable to comply with the contractual terms of the loan 
the specific reserve component is an estimate of loss based upon an impairment review of larger loans that are considered impaired 
the general reserve includes an estimate of commercial and consumer loans with similar characteristics 
depending on the set of facts  the bank utilizes one of the three following methods for determining the proper impairment of a loan the present value of expected future cash flows of a loan  the market price of the loan based upon readily available information for that type of loan  and fair value of collateral the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based  for all collateral dependent loans  on the fair market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
for non collateral dependent loans such as accruing troubled debt restructurings  the allowance is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted by the loan s effective interest rate 
a small portion of the bank s loans which are included in the asc component carry no specific reserve allocation 
these loans were reviewed for impairment and considered adequately collateralized with respect to their respective outstanding principal loan balance 
the majority of these loans are loans which have had their respective impairment or reserve amounts charged off  or are loans related to other impaired loans which continue to have a specific reserve allocation 
it is the bank s practice to maintain these impaired loans  as analyzed and provided for in the asc component of the allowance for loan losses  to avoid double counting of any estimated losses that may have been included in the asc component of the allowance for loan losses 
generally  the bank orders a new or updated appraisal on real estate properties which are subject to an impairment review 
upon completion of the impairment review  loan reserves are increased as warranted 
charge offs  if necessary  are generally recognized in a period after the reserves were established 
adjustments to new or updated appraisal values are not typical  but in those cases when an adjustment is necessary it is documented with supporting information and is typically an adjustment to decrease the property s value because of additional information obtained concerning the property after the appraisal or update has been received by the bank 
the bank s practice is to obtain new or updated appraisals on the loans subject to impairment review 
if a new or updated appraisal is not available at the time of a loan s impairment review  the bank typically applies a discount to the value of an old appraisal to reflect the property s current estimated value if there is believed to be deterioration in either i the physical or economic aspects of the subject property or ii any market conditions 
loans secured by a to family residential property with small to moderate value  are generally valued utilizing a broker s opinion of value bpo 
generally  an as is value is utilized in most of the bank s real estate based impairment analyses 

table of contents however  under certain limited circumstances an as stabilized valuation may be utilized  provided that the as stabilized value is tied to a well justified action plan to bring the real estate project to a stabilized occupancy under a reasonable period of time 
if a partially charged off loan has been restructured in a manner that is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to prudently modified terms  and has sustained historical payment performance for a reasonable period of time prior to and or after the restructuring  it may be returned to accrual status and is classified as a troubled debt restructured tdr loan 
however  if the above conditions can not be reasonably met  the loan remains on non accrual status 
in addition  the bank evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for loans being placed on non accrual status 
a loan is generally placed on non accrual status if i it becomes days or more past due days past due for consumer loans  or ii for which payment in full of both principal and interest can not be reasonably expected 
historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
the loss rates applied to commercial loans are derived from analyzing a range of the loss experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade 
these loss rates may be adjusted to account for environmental factors if warranted 
the general reserve also includes homogeneous loans  such as consumer installment  residential mortgage and home equity loans that are not individually risk graded 
rather  a range of historic loss experience of the portfolio is used to determine the appropriate allowance for the portfolios 
allocations for the allowance are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs for one year 
a high and low range of reserve percentages is calculated to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for pools of loans 
the position of the allowance for loan losses within the computed range may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions of credit quality 
factors that management considers in this analysis include the effects of the local economy  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs and nonaccrual loans  changes in mix of loans  asset quality trends  risk management and loan administration  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and internal review by the credit department 
reserves on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge off experience 
charge offs are recognized when it becomes evident that a loan or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible regardless of its delinquent status 
the bank generally charges off that portion of a loan that is determined to be unsupported by an obligor s continued ability to repay the loan from income and or assets  both pledged and unpledged as collateral 
financial condition driving the changes to the bkfc balance sheet from december  to december  was the strong deposit growth experienced throughout  bkfc s participation in the cpp and the integra bank acquisition 
total deposits increased  or from the end of to the end of excluding the deposits added with the integra bank acquisition  organic growth in deposits was approximately  or an increase from as discussed above  the cpp added approximately  to capital  while the total integra bank transactions added approximately  in deposits and  in loans to the balance sheet in as a result of these changes the bank s total assets increased  or from  at december  to  at december  on the asset side of the balance sheet  the strong deposit growth and the funding from the cpp outpaced quality loan demand and as a result both available for sale securities and short term investments grew significantly from december of to december of in  available for sale securities increased  or from while short term investments increased  from  at december  to  at december  the increase in available for sale securities consisted of purchases of 
table of contents government sponsored agency bonds and government agency mbs 
the increase in short term investments was related to higher federal funds sold to other financial institutions 
in  total loans increased  or  of which approximately  were acquired in the transactions with integra bank 
while the bank continues to experience decreased levels of new and renewed residential real estate  commercial and consumer loans originated as a result of the current economic recession  the company has experienced organic loan growth  approximately  outside of the integra bank transactions  as a result of the level of lending outpacing the bank s runoff rate 
while management expects continued decreases in new and renewed loan origination  the bank intends to continue to work to make loans that meet its longstanding prudent lending standards 
the total growth in loans was distributed between commercial  commercial real estate  residential real estate in  with increases of     and   respectively 
the largest increase in deposits came from now negotiable orders of withdrawal accounts  which increased  or  from the bank s now accounts include public fund accounts which increased  or from public funds are deposits of local municipalities  schools and other public entities 
these public fund balances are collateralized with bkfc s security portfolio and letter of credit guarantees from the fhlb 
other changes on the asset side of the balance sheet at december  relative to december   included a  increase in goodwill and acquisition intangibles as a result of the integra bank and tapke asset management acquisitions and a  increase in other assets  which was driven by the  prepaid fdic assessment paid in december of other changes to liabilities included a decrease of  in short term borrowings and an increase in other liabilities of  
contributing to decrease in short term borrowings was the payoff of a  revolving line of credit at the holding company 
the increase in other liabilities was the result of a final settlement due to integra bank for the acquisition of  that was paid in january of total shareholders equity increased  to  at december   compared to  at december  the cpp investment contributed approximately  to the increase in shareholders equity

while other financial institutions were hampered by securities losses and other than temporary impairment charges in their securities portfolio  the bank took advantage of the low interest rate environment and sold  in government sponsored agency bonds for a gain of  the low interest rate environment also led to the increase in mortgage banking income as the demand by homeowners to refinance their existing loans to lower rates remained high throughout the year

provision for loan losses like many other financial institutions  the bank was significantly affected by the national economic recession 
while the bank experienced an increase in defaults and foreclosures in fiscal year and  the levels of such activity has been significantly less than other regions in the country due  in part  to the fact that the bank s market in the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati area did not experience as dramatic a rise in real estate values over the last several years as other markets 
management believes that with the continuing economic uncertainty  high unemployment rates and falling real estate values  negative trends in credit metrics and the resulting pressure on earnings will remain above historical levels 
this will include continuing higher levels of charge offs in the loan portfolio  and as a result  higher provisions for loan losses and a higher reserve for loan losses on the balance sheet 
higher provisions will lead to lower earnings and slower capital growth 
management also believes that the current economic conditions will lead to lower demand for loans within all loan types  specifically  real estate related requests

contributing to both the increase in charge offs in and the increase in the allowance for loan losses allocated to impaired loans was the significant decrease in real estate values experienced in the current economic recession

management continues to monitor the loan portfolio closely and believes the provision for loan losses is directionally consistent with the changes in the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio from to the bank does not originate or purchase sub prime loans for its portfolio 
management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effects of the slumping housing market conditions and any signs of further deterioration in credit quality on the bank s loan portfolio 
management believes these economic strains will continue into and expects continuing higher than normal credit losses and provisioning expense in the foreseeable future 
monitoring loan quality and maintaining an adequate allowance is an ongoing process overseen by senior management and the loan review function 
on at least a quarterly basis  a formal analysis of the adequacy of the allowance is prepared and reviewed by management and the board of directors 
this analysis serves as a point in time assessment of the level of the allowance and serves as a basis for provisions for loan losses

table of contents in order to meet the financing needs of its customers  the bank is also a party to certain financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in bkfc s consolidated balance sheets 
table presents  as of december   the bank s significant off balance sheet commitments 
table significant off balance sheet commitments in thousands maturity by period total less than year years years more than years unused lines of credit and loan commitments standby letters of credit fhlb letters of credit unused lines of credit and loan commitments assure a borrower of financing for a specified period of time at a specified rate 
the risk to the bank under such commitments is limited to the terms of the contracts 
for example  the bank may not be obligated to advance funds if the customer s financial condition deteriorates or if the customer fails to meet specific covenants 
an approved  but unfunded  loan commitment represents a potential credit risk once the funds are advanced to the customer 
the unused lines of credit and loan commitments also represent a future cash requirement  but this cash requirement will be limited since many commitments are expected to expire or only be used partially 
standby letters of credit represent commitments by the bank to repay a third party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay a loan or debt instrument 
the terms and risk of loss involved in issuing standby letters of credit are similar to those involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
in addition to credit risk  the letters of credit could present an immediate cash requirement if the obligations require funding 
the bank maintains letters of credit from the fhlb to collateralize public funds deposits 
these letters of credit reduce the bank s available borrowing line at the fhlb 
on march   the bank entered into an agreement with northern kentucky university whereby the university granted to the bank the naming rights for the new northern kentucky university arena constructed on the campus of the university for a term commencing immediately upon execution of the agreement and expiring twenty years after the opening of the arena 
in consideration therefore  the bank paid the lesser of of the total construction cost of the arena or  such sum to be paid in seven equal annual installments beginning after substantial completion and opening of the arena 
the cost of the naming rights will be amortized over the life of the contract commencing on the opening of the arena  which took place in september in the second quarter of  the bank and thomas more college announced a naming rights agreement for the new athletic field constructed on thomas more s campus 
the bank committed million to the project  such sum to be paid in five equal annual installments beginning after substantial completion of the field  which is named the bank of kentucky field 
the cost of the naming rights will be amortized over the twenty five year life of the agreement commencing on the opening of the field  which took place in september further discussion of the bank s contractual obligations and off balance sheet activities is included in note of bkfc s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the availability of sufficient levels of cash to fund operations  such as meeting deposit withdrawals  funding loan commitments  paying expenses  meeting its quarterly payment obligations under certain subordinated debentures issued by bkfc in connection with the issuance of floating rate redeemable trust preferred securities issued by bkfc s unconsolidated trust subsidiary and meeting its quarterly dividend payment for the preferred stock associated with the capital purchase program 
the source of the funds for bkfc s debt obligations is dependent on the bank 
during  as discussed in the financial condition section of this report  the growth in the loans and securities were funded by the growth in deposits and the funding from the issuance of the preferred stock 
at december   the bank s customers had available  in unused lines and letters of credit  and the bank has further extended loan commitments totaling  historically  many such commitments have expired without being drawn and  accordingly  do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
if needed  the bank has the ability to borrow term and overnight funds from the federal home loan bank or other financial intermediaries 
further  the bank has  of securities designated as available for sale and an additional  of held to maturity securities that mature within one year that can serve as sources of funds 
management is satisfied that bkfc s liquidity is sufficient at december  to meet known and potential obligations 
as illustrated in bkfc s statement of cash flows  the net change in cash and cash equivalents was an increase of  net income provided  of the  in the bank s cash flows from operating activities  while the largest cash outflow from investing activities was in the form of an increase in available for sale securities of  the bank also used  to purchase loans in as discussed in the financial condition section of this report  the largest source of cash from financing activities came from the increase in deposits 
during  the bank could be required to obtain approval from the kentucky department of financial institutions to declare dividends to bkfc 
this restriction is in place if the accumulated dividends paid to bkfc over current and previous two years are greater than the accumulated earnings of the bank for those periods 
this was a result of the  payoff of the trust preferred securities at bkfc with a  subordinated debenture as detailed in note of bkfc s consolidated financial statements entered into at the bank in this transaction required the bank to declare a  dividend to pay off these securities of bkfc 
this transaction was approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies  and the bank expects to receive approval from the department of financial institutions to pay dividends to bkfc in in  bkfc paid cash dividends of 
per share totaling  on common stock and a total of  for dividends on preferred stock 
the fdic has issued regulations relating a bank s deposit insurance assessment and certain aspects of its operations to specified capital levels 
a well capitalized bank  one with a leverage ratio of or more and a total risk based capital ratio of or more  and no particular areas of supervisory concern  pays the lowest premium and is subject to the fewest restrictions 
the bank s capital levels and ratios exceed the regulatory definitions of well capitalized institutions 
at december   bkfc s leverage and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  which exceed all required ratios established for bank holding companies 
effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 

table of contents adoption of new accounting standards in june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance relating to gaap asc and establishing the fasb codification the codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental gaap in the united states 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec are also sources of authoritative gaap for companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
asc was effective for financial statements that cover interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of this guidance by the company did not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition 
technical references to gaap are now provided in these financial statements under this new fasb structure 
in december  the fasb issued guidance impacting asc  business combinations  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in an acquire  including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the impact of adoption of this standard is disclosed in note to these financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance impacting asc  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which amends existing guidance for determining whether impairment is other than temporary for debt securities 
the additional guidance requires an entity to assess whether it intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of these criteria is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized in earnings 
for securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria  the amount of impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the amount related to credit losses  while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
additionally  the guidance expands and increases the frequency of existing disclosures about other than temporary impairments for debt and equity securities 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  the company adopted this guidance in the second quarter of the adoption of this guidance is reflected in note to these financial statements and did not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition 
in april  the fasb issued guidance impacting asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset and liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
this additional guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants 
the guidance provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in relation to normal market activity 
in addition  when transactions or quoted prices are not considered orderly  adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be needed to determine the appropriate fair value 
the guidance also requires increased disclosures 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   and shall be applied prospectively 
early adoption is permitted for periods ending after march  the company adopted this guidance during the second quarter of  and the adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
effect of newly issued but not yet effective accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
asc 
the new accounting requirement amends previous guidance relating to the transfers of financial assets and eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity 
this statement must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
this statement must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
additionally  on and after the effective date  the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting purposes 
therefore  formerly qualifying special purpose entities should be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities on and after the effective date in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
additionally  the disclosure provisions of this statement were also amended and apply to transfers that occurred both before and after the effective date of this statement 
the effect of adopting this new guidance is not expected to have a material affect on the company s results of operations or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to interest rate risk  exchange rate risk  equity price risk or commodity price risk 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument and is not currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  equity price risk or commodity price risk 
the bank s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the bank utilizes an earnings simulation model to measure and define the amount of interest rate risk it assumes 
interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a decline in fair market values 
interest rate risk results from the fact that the interest sensitive assets and liabilities can adjust their rates at different times and by different amounts 
the goal of asset liability management is to maintain a high  yet stable  net interest margin and to manage the effect that changes in market interest rates will have on net interest income 
a common measure of interest rate risk is interest rate gap measurement 
the gap is the difference  in dollars  between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that will reprice within a certain time frame 
repricing can occur when an asset or liability matures or  if an adjustable rate instrument  when it can be adjusted 
typically  the measurement will focus on the interest rate gap position over the next months 
an institution is said to have a negative gap position when more interest bearing liabilities reprice within a certain period than interest earning assets  and a positive gap position when more interest earning assets reprice than interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate gap is considered an indicator of the effect that changing rates may have on net interest income 
generally  an institution with a negative gap will benefit from declining market interest rates and be negatively impacted by rising interest rates 
the bank currently is in a negative gap position    and as a result would  without considering other factors  generally benefit from lower rates and be negatively impacted by higher interest rates 
the ability to benefit from the bank s liability sensitive position would depend on a number of factors  including the competitive pressures on consumer deposit and loan pricing  the movement of certain deposit rate indices in relationship to asset rate indices  and the extent of the decrease in the rate environment 
at december   bkfc s month interest rate gap position  as measured by the bank s asset liability model  was negative 
over the preceding months  interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeded interest rate sensitive assets by  of total assets 
at december   interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeded interest rate sensitive assets by  of total assets 
contributing to the decreased liability sensitive position from to was higher levels of short term investments 
contributing to the increase in short term investments was the strong deposit growth experienced in and the cpp funds 
an assumption  based on historical behavior  contributing to bkfc s gap position is that the balances in now and savings accounts react within a two year timeframe to market rate changes  rather than reacting immediately 
these instruments are not tied to specific indices and are only influenced by market conditions and other factors 
the bank s experience with now and savings accounts has been that they have repriced at a pace equal to approximately of a prime change 
accordingly  a general movement in interest rates may not have an immediate effect on the rates paid on those deposit accounts 
the bank s asset liability management policy establishes guidelines governing the amount of interest income at risk  market value at risk and parameters for the gap position 
management continually monitors these risks through the use of gap analysis and the earnings simulation model 
the simulation model is used to estimate and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on earnings and market value 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the assumptions used in the simulation are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income 
the results of the model are used by management to approximate the results of rate changes and do not indicate actual expected results 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in various management strategies and market conditions 
additionally  actual results can differ materially from the model if interest rates do not move equally across the yield curve 
for the changes in the estimates of an increasing rate scenario on the net interest income change  as shown below  between to was a result of the same influences that increased the liability sensitivity of bkfc s gap position 
however the differences in the estimates for a decreasing rate environment are the results of the current rate environment 
in december of the federal reserve bank lowered the targeted federal funds rate to  and as a result most short term deposit interest rates cannot drop basis points while earning assets could in theory decrease by these amounts 
the result of this extreme low rate environment is both rising and declining rate scenarios produce a negative impact on earnings 
net interest income estimates are summarized below 
net interest income change increase bp increase bp decrease bp the table below provides information about the quantitative market risk of interest sensitive instruments at december  dollars in thousands and shows the contractually repricing intervals  and related average interest rates  for each of the next five years and thereafter 
as discussed above  while this table uses the contractual repricing intervals for now and savings accounts and therefore reflects the bank s ability to adjust rates on those accounts at any time  the bank s interest rate risk model incorporates assumptions based on historical behavior to determine the expected repricing of these deposits
