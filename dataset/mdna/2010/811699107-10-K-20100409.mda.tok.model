fixed deferred cash payments of million will be paid on february    and under the earnout provisions of the purchase agreement  the company will be obligated to make additional payments based upon the operating results of vividlogic over the three one year periods following the closing 
acquisition related costs recognized include legal  accounting  valuation and other professional services of  for fiscal the transaction costs were expensed and recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company initiated actions to lower its cost structure as it strives to generate increased profitability for this fiscal year 
the first quarter of fiscal will include pre tax restructuring charges to its income statement totaling approximately million related to the termination of approximately employees 
until the end of fiscal  the company was managed and operated as three segments  broadcast  broadband and services 
in its first quarter of fiscal  the company realigned its previously reported segments into three new reporting segments software  servers and storage  and media services as segments defined by the authoritative accounting guidance 
the company believes this reorganization better reflects the increasing importance and magnitude of its software products and services as well as the scale of its odg subsidiary 
a description of the three reporting segments is as follows software segment includes product revenues from the company s advertising  vod  middleware and broadcast software  related services such as professional services  installation  training  project management  product maintenance  technical support and software development for those software products  and operating expenses relating to the software segment such as research and development  selling and marketing and amortization of intangibles 
the software segment includes the results of eventis from the date of the acquisition on september  servers and storage segment includes product revenues from vod and broadcast server product lines and related services such as professional services  installation  training  project management  product maintenance  and technical support for those products and operating expenses relating to the servers and storage segment  such as research and development and selling and marketing 
media services segment includes the operations of odg  and commencing in fiscal the operations of mobix interactive  activities which include content acquisition and preparation services for television and wireless service providers and related operating expenses 
under this revised reporting structure  the company determined there are significant functions  and therefore costs considered corporate expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions 
these unallocated costs include general and administrative expenses  other than general and administrative expenses related to media services  interest and other income  net  taxes and equity losses in affiliates  which are managed separately at the corporate level 
the segment data for the fiscal year ended january  has been recast to reflect the realignment of the new segments 
prior to fiscal  services revenues  which included odg revenues  were reported in the services segment and the company did not separately track these service revenues and costs by these new segments  except for odg 
accordingly  management has made certain assumptions to determine the amount of service revenues and service costs attributed to the software and servers and storage reporting segments for the fiscal year ended january  the basis of the assumptions for all such revenues  costs and expenses includes significant judgments and estimations 
there are no inter segment revenues for the periods 
the company does not separately track all assets by operating segments nor are the segments evaluated under this criterion 
we have experienced fluctuations in our product revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of the receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s receipt of authorized signatures on their purchase orders  the budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material to produce the product  the time required to produce and test the product before delivery  and the customer s required delivery date 
during these economic times  many customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable  excess and obsolete inventory  gross margin deterioration  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition and supplier difficulties 
we believe that the recent global economic slowdown caused certain customers to reduce or delay capital spending plans in fiscal primarily in our advertising and broadcast products  and expect that these conditions could persist into fiscal in addition  we have experienced increased price based competition from our competitors  which resulted in the reduction of the prices of some of our products  which reduced our revenues and adversely affected our gross margin 
the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue reported on a quarterly basis 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs and consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined from product introduction to product maturity 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have historically increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing and administration 
in the current state of the economy  we currently expect that customers may still have limited capital spending budgets as we believe they are dependent on advertising revenues to fund their capital equipment purchases 
accordingly  we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
in light of the higher proportion of our international business  we expect movements in foreign exchange rates to have a greater impact on our operating results and the equity section of our balance sheet in the future 
our ability to continue to generate revenues within the markets that our products are sold and to generate cash from operations and net income is dependent on several factors which include market acceptance of the products and services offered by our customers and increased subscriber usage and demand for these products and services  selection by our customers of our products and services versus the products and services being offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products to the market in a timely manner and to meet the demands of the market for new products and product enhancements  our ability to maintain gross margins from the sale of our products and services at a level that will provide us with cash to fund our operations given the pricing pressures within the market and the costs of materials to manufacture our products  our ability to control operating costs given the fluctuations that we have experienced with revenues from quarter to quarter  and our ability to successfully integrate businesses acquired by us  including eventis  vividlogic  inc and mobix interactive  ltd 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
principles of consolidation 
the company consolidates the financial statements of its wholly owned subsidiaries and all inter company accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
seachange also holds minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that have strategic importance 
the company evaluates its equity and debt investments and other contractual relationships with affiliate companies in order to determine whether the guidelines regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities vie should be applied in the financial statements 
consolidation guidelines address consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a vie is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the financial position and results of the vie 
the company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary for any variable interest entities as of january  the company s investments in affiliates include investments accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting 
the investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the common shares of the affiliate are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common shares of the affiliate  seachange s proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate are included in equity loss in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations 
we periodically review indicators of the fair value of our investments in affiliates in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  may suggest an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
the carrying value of an investment in an affiliate may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting related to revenue recognition is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
revenues from sales of hardware  software and systems that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
customers are billed for installation  training  project management and at least one year of product maintenance and technical support at the time of the product sale 
revenue from these activities are deferred at the time of the product sale and recognized ratably over the period these services are performed 
revenue from ongoing product maintenance and technical support agreements are recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements 
revenue from software development contracts that include significant modification or customization  including software product enhancements  is recognized based on the percentage of completion contract accounting method using labor efforts expended in relation to estimates of total labor efforts to complete the contract 
for contracts  where some level of profit is assured but the company is only able to estimate ranges of amounts of total contract revenue and total contract cost  the company uses the lowest probable level of profits in accounting for the contract revenues and costs 
accounting for contract amendments and customer change orders are included in contract accounting when executed 
revenue from shipping and handling costs and other out of pocket expenses reimbursed by customers are included in revenues and cost of revenues 
our share of inter company profits associated with sales and services provided to affiliated companies is eliminated in consolidation in proportion to our equity ownership 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of hardware  software  systems and services in multiple element arrangements 
revenues under multiple element arrangements are recorded based on the residual method of accounting 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements 
where fair value of undelivered service elements has not been established  the total arrangement value is recognized over the period during which the services are performed 
the amounts allocated to undelivered elements  which may include project management  training  installation  maintenance and technical support and hardware and software components  are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation  training and project management revenue is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
these services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for multiple element arrangements that include software development with significant modification or customization and systems sales where vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement other than maintenance and technical support  percentage of completion accounting is applied for revenue recognition purposes to the entire arrangement with the exception of maintenance and technical support 
we recognize revenue for product and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition but generally does not require collateral 
for some international customers  the company may require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
the company monitors payments from customers and assesses any collection issues 
the company maintains allowances for specific doubtful accounts and other risk categories of accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of the company s customers to make required payments and records these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
the company bases its allowances for doubtful accounts on historical collections and write off experience  current trends  credit assessments  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  additional allowances may be required or established allowances may be considered unnecessary 
judgment is required in making these determinations and our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
service revenue from content processing provided to our customers is recognized when services are provided  based on contracted rates 
upfront fees received for services are recognized ratably over the period earned  whichever is the longer of the contract term or the estimated customer relationship 
any taxes assessed by a governmental authority related to revenue producing transactions eg sales or value added taxes are reported on a net basis and excluded from revenues 
inventories and reserves 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components and subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of seachange s hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
the value of inventories is reviewed quarterly to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
seachange records charges to reduce inventory to its net realizable value when impairment is identified through the quarterly review process 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
for the years ended january   and  we recorded inventory write downs of  million  and million  respectively 
accounting for business combinations in our business combinations  we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include but are not limited to the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  which is calculated using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based upon the forecasted achievement of post acquisition bookings targets  the future expected cash flows from product sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  and the relevant discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
additionally  any change in the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes from events after the acquisition date  such as changes in our estimate of the bookings that are expected to be achieved  will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change 
a change in fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration could have a material effect on the statement of operations and financial position in the period of the change in estimate 
goodwill 
in connection with acquisitions of operating entities  we recognize the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment  at the reporting unit level  annually in our third quarter as of august goodwill of a reporting unit also is tested for impairment on an interim basis in addition to the annual evaluation if an event occurs or circumstances change which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
changes in operating performance  market conditions and other factors may adversely impact estimates of expected future cash flows 
any impairment indicated by this analysis would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value based on forecasted cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved 
goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level  which is equivalent to our business segments 
we have three reporting segments  the software segment  servers and storage segment and media services segment 
the goodwill balance as of january  is as follows servers media software storage services totals in thousands goodwill    on august   we performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of the reporting units with goodwill balances 
we first calculated the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology 
we then performed step and compared the fair value of each reporting unit of accounting to its carrying value as of august  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment requires several judgments and assumptions to be made to determine the fair value of the reporting units  including the method used to determine fair value  discount rates  expected levels of cash flows  revenues and earnings  and the selection of comparable companies used to develop market based assumptions 
consistent with prior years  we employed a five year discounted cash flow methodology to arrive at the fair value of each reporting unit 
in calculating the fair value  we derived the standalone projected five year cash flows for all three reporting units 
this process starts with the projected cash flows of each of the three reporting units and then the cash flows are discounted 
we use the discounted cash flow methodology as our principal technique as we believe that the discounted cash flows approach provides greater detail and opportunity to reflect facts  circumstances and economic conditions for each reporting unit 
we determined that based on our annual goodwill test  the reporting fair values of all three of our reporting units containing goodwill balances exceeded their carrying values 
in aggregate  there was excess fair value over the carrying value of the net assets ranging from million 
below is a summary of the fair values ranges calculated by the company as of august  premium ranges over carrying value software servers and storage media services key data points included in the market capitalization calculation were as follows shares outstanding as of august  million  and trailing day average closing price as of august  per share 
accordingly  as no impairment indicator existed as of august   our annual impairment test date  and the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of any of our three reporting units  we determined that goodwill was not at risk of failing step and was appropriately stated as of august  to validate our conclusions and determine the reasonableness of our annual impairment test  we also performed the following reconciled our estimated enterprise value to market capitalization comparing the aggregate  calculated fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of august   our annual impairment test date 
as compared with the market capitalization value of million as of august   the aggregate carrying values of our three reporting units was approximately million  prepared a reporting unit fair value calculation using discounted cash flows  reviewed the historical operating performance of each reporting unit for the current fiscal year  performed a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal growth rates  and reviewed market participant assumptions 
the discounted cash flows used to estimate fair values were based on assumptions regarding each reporting unit s estimated projected future cash flows and estimated weighted average cost of capital that a market participant would use in evaluating the reporting unit in a purchase transaction 
we employed one weighted average cost of capital rate for all our reporting units 
the estimated weighted average cost of capital was based on the risk free interest rate and other factors such as equity risk premiums and the ratio of total debt to equity capital 
in performing the annual impairment tests  we took steps to ensure appropriate and reasonable cash flow projections and assumptions were used 
the average rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows for each of the reporting units was 
our projections for the next five years included increased revenue and operating expenses  in line with the expected revenue growth over the next five years based on current market and economic conditions and our historical knowledge of the reporting units 
historical growth rates served as only one input to the projected future growth used in the goodwill impairment analysis 
these historical growth rates were adjusted based on other inputs from management regarding anticipated customer contracts 
we projected growth for each reporting unit ranging from to annually for the software and servers and storage segments  and from to annually for the media services segment 
the higher projected growth for the media services segment is due to the recent contract wins by odg and mobix 
we estimated the operating expenses based on a rate consistent with the current experience for each reporting unit and estimated revenue growth over the next five years 
the failure of any of our reporting units to execute as forecasted over the next five years could have an adverse affect on our annual impairment test 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the reporting unit could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in reporting units  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we also monitor economic  legal and other factors as a whole and for each reporting unit between annual impairment tests to ensure that there are no indicators that make it more likely than not that there has been a decline in the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
specifically  we monitor industry trends  our market capitalization  recent and forecasted financial performance of our reporting units and the timing and nature of any restructuring activities 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change  we may be required to record non cash impairment charges for these assets in the future 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company evaluated the impairment analysis and updated for the change in market capitalization as from august  to january  while no impairment charges resulted from the analyses performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  impairment charges may occur in the future due to changes in projected revenue growth rates  projected operating margins or estimated discount rates  among other factors 
historical or projected revenues or cash flows may not be indicative of actual future results 
due to uncertain market conditions  it is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of goodwill and or other intangible assets  which could result in charges that could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
long lived assets 
seachange also evaluates property and equipment  investments  intangible assets and other long lived assets on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external that may suggest an asset is not recoverable 
if such circumstances exist  seachange evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compares that value to the carrying value of the assets 
seachange s cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
intangible assets consist of customer contracts  completed technology  in process research and development  non competition agreements  patents and trademarks and are respectively assigned to the operating segments 
the intangible assets are amortized to cost of sales and operating expenses  as appropriate  on a straight line or accelerated basis in order to reflect the period that the assets will be consumed 
in process research and development assets as of the acquisition date were recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets and will be subject to impairment testing at least annually 
the useful life of the intangible asset recognized will be reconsidered if and when an in process research and development project is completed or abandoned 
seachange develops software for resale in markets that are subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs 
the time period during which software development costs can be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short  and consequently  the amounts that could be capitalized are not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
software development costs relating to sales of software requiring significant modification or customization are charged to costs of product revenues 
amortization expense of capitalized software is recorded over the period of economic consumption or the life of the agreement  whichever results in the higher expense  starting with the first shipment of the product to a customer 
amortization expense of capitalized software was  and  for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we will record a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets in the future is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax provision  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance against our united states deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not be fully realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating sufficient pre tax income in future periods 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
seachange does not provide for us federal and state income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its non us subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested in the operations outside the us authoritative guidance as it relates to income tax liabilities states that the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent 
the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
the changes in estimate could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results 
in addition  settlement of any particular position could have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position 
share based compensation 
we account for all employee and non employee director stock based compensation awards using the authoritative guidance regarding share based payments 
we have continued to use the black scholes pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all applicable awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management estimated the volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the estimated fair value of seachange s stock based options and performance based restricted stock units  less expected forfeitures  is amortized over the awards vesting period on a graded vesting basis  whereas the restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan stock units are amortized on a straight line basis 
restructuring 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed a restructuring and will record restructuring charges primarily related to employee severance 
restructuring charges represent our best estimate of the associated liability at the date the charges are recognized 
adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period they become known 
differences between actual and expected charges and changes in assumptions could have a material effect on our restructuring accrual as well as our consolidated results of operations 
foreign currency translation 
for subsidiaries where the us dollar is designated as the functional currency of the entity  we translate that entity s monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies into us dollars the functional and reporting currency at current exchange rates  as of each balance sheet date 
non monetary assets eg  inventories  property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets and related income statement accounts eg  cost of sales  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets are translated at historical exchange rates between the functional currency the us dollar and the local currency 
revenue and other expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the fiscal period 
translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and any unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in other income or expense  net 
for subsidiaries where the local currency is designated as the functional currency  we translate the subsidiaries assets and liabilities into us dollars the reporting currency at current exchange rates as of each balance sheet date 
revenue and expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the period 
cumulative translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in other income or expense  net 
the aggregate foreign exchange transaction losses included as other expense  net on the consolidated statement of operations were   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
non gaap measures as part of our ongoing review of financial information related to our business  we regularly use non gaap measures  in particular adjusted non gaap earnings per share  as we believe they provide a meaningful insight into our business and trends 
we also believe that these adjusted non gaap measures provide readers of our financial statements with useful information and insight with respect to the results of our business 
however  the presentation of adjusted non gaap information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

management believes that excluding these items mentioned below is useful in understanding trends and managing our operations 
we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 
deferred software revenue business combination accounting rules require us to account for the fair value of customer contracts assumed in connection with our acquisitions 
in connection with the acquisition of eventis group bv on september   the book value of our deferred software revenue was reduced by approximately million in the adjustment to fair value 
because these customer contracts may take up to months to complete  our gaap revenues subsequent to this acquisition do not reflect the full amount of software revenues on assumed customer contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by eventis group bv we believe this adjustment is useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business because we have historically experienced high renewal rates on similar customer contracts  although we cannot be certain that customers will renew these contracts 
stock based compensation expenses we have excluded the effect of stock based compensation and stock based payroll expenses from our non gaap operating expenses and net income measures 
although stock based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees  we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock based compensation expenses 
stock based compensation expenses will recur in future periods 
amortization of intangible assets we have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non gaap operating expenses and net income measures 
amortization of intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions 
acquisition related and other expenses we incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions of eventis group bv and vividlogic  inc and also incurred certain other operating expenses  which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations 
acquisition related and other expenses consist of transaction costs  costs for transitional employees  other acquired employee related costs  and integration related professional services 
restructuring we incurred charges due to the restructuring of our business including severance charges and impairment charges related to capitalized software licenses  which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations

servers and storage services revenue accounted for and of total services revenue in the fiscal year ended january  and  respectively  while media services revenue accounted for of total services revenue for the fiscal years ended january  and the increase in services revenues was primarily in our software segment and was due to increased vod support maintenance and professional services and the inclusion of five months of eventis for fiscal  and is also due to higher contract revenues in our media services segment 
for the fiscal year ended january  and  two customers each accounted for more than  and collectively accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues

we expect that international products and services revenues will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
a majority of our international sales are made in united states dollars usd  and for the fiscal years and  approximately and  of international revenues were transacted in usd 
software revenue 
revenues from our software segment decreased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the year over year decline in software product revenues was primarily due to significantly lower software licensing revenue from our advertising insertion products and our broadcast software products due to the unfavorable advertising environment for our customers for those products as noted above 
in addition  there were also two large nonrecurring orders during our fiscal for our vodlink and vod hospitality software products 
these decreases were partially offset by higher software licensing revenues of axiom and higher vod subscription revenue primarily from two large us customers 
in addition we had higher shipments of our vod adpulse software products primarily to virgin media 
the increase in service revenue for the software segment was primarily due to higher vod product maintenance revenues from a growing installed base of products  higher vod software installation revenues and the inclusion of five months of eventis for fiscal servers and storage revenue 
revenues from the server and storage segment decreased to million for the fiscal year ended january  from for the fiscal year ended january  the decrease in servers and storage product revenues of compared to the previous year was due primarily to lower order driven broadcast server revenue partially offset by higher increased shipments of vod servers primarily to two large us service providers  a large customer in latin america and several customers in china 
the year over year increase in services revenue in the servers and storage segment is due to increased installation revenue for vod server products year over year 
media services revenue 
revenues from media services increased to million in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  the increase in revenue was due primarily to a full year s impact of revenue from customers in greece and turkey for which we began to recognize revenue late in fiscal year and the recent contract wins during fiscal year with customers in france  dubai and cyprus

the gross profit percentage for products increased from in the fiscal year ended january  to in the fiscal year ended january  the year over year increase in product gross profit percentages between years was due mainly to higher margin vod software products accounting for a greater portion of total product revenues combined with lower broadcast server products revenues  which typically carry lower margins 
services gross profit 
cost of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support  software development  project management and costs associated with providing media services

servers and storage gross profit 
servers and storage segment gross margin of in the year ended january  was six points lower than in the year ended january  due to increased shipments of lower margin vod servers due to lower product pricing for a large us customer and lower service margins as a result of higher vod server headcount related costs to service the larger installed base of products 
media services gross profit 
media services segment gross margin of in the year ended january  was two points higher than in the year ended january  due principally to absorbing all content processing in house that was previously provided by a third party

research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal year ended january  and  respectively  and increased million year over year 
the increase year over year is primarily due to increased headcount costs related to the vod and tv navigator product lines  increased facilities related expenses and five months of eventis for fiscal we expect that total research and development expenses will increase in the fiscal year primarily due to a full year s impact of the recent acquisitions of eventis and vividlogic selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased from million or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  this decrease in total expenses is primarily due to lower compensation and benefits of million   of lower external commission and  in travel offset by the inclusion of five months of eventis in fiscal we expect that in total selling and marketing expenses will increase in fiscal year as we will have a full year s impact of the recent acquisition of eventis

an additional  and  of amortization expense related to acquired technology was charged to cost of sales for the years ended january  and  respectively 
other income expense

foreign exchange loss

income tax provision 
our effective tax rate and income tax provision for fiscal was and  compared to an effective tax rate of and  for the fiscal year ended january  the difference between the underlying effective tax rate for the year ended january  and the federal statutory rate of is primarily due to income tax expense on foreign source pre tax income generated at our international subsidiaries which carry lower tax rates 
in addition  the company tax rate decreased in the us based on the benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation for the utilization of foreign tax credits and federal research and development credits 
at january  and  we provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of us net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realization of those assets 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we determine that we can realize some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be recognized during the period

impact of recently adopted accounting guidance business combinations in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised accounting guidance requiring the use of fair value  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the new guidance also changes the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
any change in the fair value of the acquisition related consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes from events after the acquisition date  such as changes in the estimate of the performance goals  will be recognized in earnings in the period the estimated fair value changes  acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
the new guidance amends accounting for income taxes such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of this guidance would also apply the provisions of this new guidance 
the new guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and was adopted by the company on february  see our note to consolidated financial statements for disclosures relating to the acquisition of eventis group bv on september  and vividlogic  inc on february  measuring liabilities at fair value in august  the fasb issued an authoritative update to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update provides amendments to reduce potential ambiguity in financial reporting when measuring the fair value of liabilities 
among other provisions  this update provides clarification in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the valuation techniques described in the authoritative update 
the update will become effective upon issuance for subsequent interim and annual periods 
the company adopted this standard on october  the company has determined that the update had no impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance requiring additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements 
the company adopted this standard on july  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance providing guidelines for making fair value measurements more consistent with the principles presented in the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance 
this new accounting guidance provides additional guidelines in determining whether a market is active or inactive  and whether a transaction is distressed  is applicable to all assets and liabilities ie financial and nonfinancial 
the company adopted this standard on april  recent accounting guidance not yet effective determining which entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest equity in december  the fasb amended authoritative guidance regarding the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement in variable interest entities  which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements 
the update will become effective for the first annual period starting after november  this guidance will be adopted by the company on a prospective basis beginning february  the company is currently assessing the impact this amendment may have on its results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables in september  the financial accounting standards boards fasb amended the guidance for revenue recognition in multiple element arrangements 
it has been amended to remove from the scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
the guidance now requires an entity to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated  and allocates revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables for these products if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence of selling price 
the guidance also eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method for these products 
the accounting changes summarized are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
the company is currently assessing the impact of these amendments on its accounting and reporting systems and processes  however  at this time the company is unable to quantify the impact of their adoption on its financial statements or determine the timing and method of its adoption 
the company believes the impact of the new guidance on future multi element arrangements may result in earlier recognition of revenue in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our foreign currency exchange exposure is primarily associated with product sales arrangements or settlement of intercompany payables and receivables among subsidiaries and its parent company  and or investment equity contingency considerations denominated in the local currency where the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is the us dollar 
substantially all of our international product sales are payable in united states dollars usd or in the case of our media services operations in the united kingdom and eventis in the netherlands  payable in local currencies  providing a natural hedge for receipts and local payments 
in light of the high proportion of our international businesses  we expect the risk of any adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have an impact on our translated results within the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  for the year ended january  the company generated a foreign currency translation loss of million which was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive gain increasing the company s equity section of the balance sheet over the prior year 
the company has entered into a forward foreign currency exchange contract to manage exposure related to liabilities denominated in euros 
seachange does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
at january   we had one forward contract to buy euros totaling million that settles on september  while seachange does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on its operating results  financial position and liquidity  a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies could harm the company s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
the us dollar is the functional currency for a majority of our international subsidiaries 
all foreign currency gains and losses are included in interest and other income  net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal year  the company recorded approximately  in losses due to international subsidiary translations and cash settlements of revenues and expenses 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to seachange s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
the company does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of nine months or less 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if the company were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  our long term marketable investments  which are carried at the lower of cost or market  have fixed interest rates  and therefore are subject to changes in fair value 
at january   we had million in short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities
