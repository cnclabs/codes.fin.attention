overview we are a leading provider of automation  vacuum and instrumentation solutions and are a highly valued business partner to original equipment manufacturers oems and equipment users throughout the world 
we serve markets where equipment productivity and availability is a critical factor for our customers success  typically in demanding temperature and or pressure environments 
our largest served market is the semiconductor manufacturing industry  which represented and of our consolidated revenues for fiscal year and  respectively 
we also provide unique solutions to customers in data storage  advanced display  analytical instruments and industrial markets 
we develop and deliver differentiated solutions that range from proprietary products to highly respected manufacturing services 
the demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical  resulting in periodic expansions and contractions 
demand for our products has been impacted by these cyclical industry conditions 
after a period of cyclical expansion  a downturn started in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that continued through the second quarter of fiscal year since that time  during a period of renewed industry expansion  our revenues have significantly increased in each fiscal quarter  although recent order rates from semiconductor companies have moderated and we anticipate that revenues in the near term will be relatively flat from the levels experienced for the fourth quarter of fiscal year throughout fiscal years and  we implemented a number of cost reduction programs to improve productivity and align our cost structure with a reduced demand environment 
our cost reduction efforts focused on actions that would decrease our overhead cost structure for the foreseeable future 
although we have added personnel during fiscal year  including temporary employees  these additions were made primarily to address increased production requirements and to invest in certain product development programs 
in connection with our restructuring programs  we have realigned our management structure and our underlying internal financial reporting structure 
effective as of the beginning of our second quarter of  we implemented a new internal reporting structure which includes three segments critical solutions group  systems solutions group and global customer operations 
financial results prior to this management structure have been revised to reflect our current segment structure 
the critical solutions group segment provides a variety of products critical to technology equipment productivity and availability 
those products include robots and robotic modules for atmospheric and vacuum applications and cryogenic vacuum pumping  thermal management and vacuum measurement solutions used to create  measure and control critical process vacuum applications 
the systems solutions group segment provides a range of products and engineering and manufacturing services  which include our extended factory services 
our extended factory product offering provides services to build equipment front end modules and other subassemblies which enable our customers to effectively develop and source high quality and high reliability process tools for semiconductor and adjacent market applications 
the global customer operations segment provides an extensive range of support services including on and off site repair services  on and off site diagnostic support services  and installation services to enable our customers to maximize process tool uptime and productivity 
this segment also provides services and spare parts for certain legacy products

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed in the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are associated with the sale of hardware systems  components and spare parts as well as product license revenue 
service revenues are associated with service contracts  repairs  upgrades and field service 
shipping and handling fees  if any  billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
revenue from product sales that do not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
in the limited situations where the arrangement contains extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue associated with service agreements is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from repair services or upgrades of customer owned equipment is recognized upon completion of the repair effort and upon the shipment of the repaired item back to the customer 
in instances where the repair or upgrade includes installation  revenue is recognized when the installation is completed 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets as a result of our acquisitions  we have identified general intangible assets other than goodwill and generated significant goodwill 
general intangible assets other than goodwill are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
general intangible assets other than goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of our fiscal year end  or september th 
under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the testing of goodwill for impairment is to be performed at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
a reporting unit is either the operating segment level or one level below  which is referred to as a component 
the level at which the impairment test is performed requires an assessment as to whether the operations below the operating segment constitute a self sustaining business  testing is 
table of contents generally required to be performed at this level 
we currently have two reporting units that have goodwill  and both of those units are part of our critical solutions group operating segment 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow method dcf method 
the dcf method includes five year future cash flow projections  which are discounted to present value  and an estimate of terminal values  which are also discounted to present value 
terminal values represent the present value an investor would pay today for the rights to the cash flows of the business for the years subsequent to the discrete cash flow projection period 
we consider the dcf method to be the most appropriate valuation indicator as the dcf analyses are based on management s long term financial projections 
given the dynamic nature of the cyclical semiconductor equipment market  management s projections as of the valuation date are considered more objective since other market metrics for peer companies fluctuate over the cycle 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be completed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  the excess of the fair value over amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million in the three month periods ended september  and march   respectively 
the details of these goodwill impairment charges are discussed further under the impairment charges caption in our comparison of fiscal year and results 
our tests of goodwill as of september  and indicated that we did not have any further impairment to goodwill 
under gaap  we are required to test long lived assets  which exclude goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized  when indicators of impairment are present 
for purposes of this test  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when we determine that indicators of potential impairment exist  the next step of the impairment test requires that the potentially impaired long lived asset group is tested for recoverability 
the test for recoverability compares the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset group to its carrying value 
if the carrying values of the long lived asset group exceed the future cash flows  the assets are considered to be potentially impaired 
the next step in the impairment process is to determine the fair value of the individual net assets within the long lived asset group 
if the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group are less then their carrying values  an impairment is recorded equal to the excess of the aggregate carrying value of the group over the aggregate fair value 
the loss is allocated to each asset within the group based on their relative carrying values  with no asset reduced below its fair value 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  million and million related to certain long lived assets in the three month periods ended september   march  and june   respectively  which we discuss in further detail under the impairment charges caption 
we have not tested long lived assets other than goodwill since the end of the second quarter of fiscal  since no events have occurred that would require an impairment assessment 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount 
trade accounts receivables do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 

table of contents warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is estimated by assessing product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management has considered the weight of all available evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance remains to be required against its deferred tax assets at september  given the losses incurred prior to fiscal year  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment market as well as the uncertainties currently impacting the global economy  we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including the generation of taxable income in future periods 
we continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all employee stock awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the excess of the quoted price of our common stock over the exercise price of the restricted stock on the date of grant  if any  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
in addition  for stock based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals  we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ from our current estimates 
restricted stock with market based vesting criteria is valued using a lattice model 

table of contents year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the total increase in revenues of million arose in all of our operating segments 
our critical solutions group segment revenues increased by million  our system solutions group segment revenues increased by million and our global customer operations segment revenues increased by million 
these increases were primarily the result of increased volume shipments in response to increasing demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
recent order rates from semiconductor companies have moderated and we anticipate that revenues in the near term will be relatively flat from the levels experienced for the fourth quarter of fiscal year our critical solutions group segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  an increase of from million in the prior year 
these increases are primarily attributable to higher volumes of shipments to semiconductor capital equipment customers  which increased for fiscal year as compared to the prior year  and an increase of million from non semiconductor customers for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
our system solutions group segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
these increases are attributable to increased demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
included within this segment is our extended factory product offering 
revenue from our extended factory product was the largest contributor to increased revenues in this segment 
our global customer operations segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily related to higher service contract and repair revenues 
all service revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations  which include service contract and repair services  are related to our global customer operations segment 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased to million for fiscal year as compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
this increase was attributable to higher revenues of million  an asset impairment charge primarily related to intangible assets of million which reduced the prior year gross profit  a million reduction in charges for excess and obsolete inventory and million of reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization expense is primarily the result of the impairment of these assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year gross margin percentage increased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues 
other factors that increased gross margin percentage include decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory which increased gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets which increased gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
further  the prior year gross margin percentage was adversely impacted by asset impairment charges which reduced gross margin percentage by in fiscal year the increases in the current year gross margin percentage were partially offset by a less favorable product mix from the rapid growth of our extended factory product offering which reduced gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to gross margin of our critical solutions group segment increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was attributable to higher revenues of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year  reduced charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and reduced amortization expense for completed technology 
table of contents intangible assets of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
gross margin percentage for this segment was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues 
other factors increasing gross margin percentage include decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory which increased gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets which increased gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to the prior year

gross margin percentage for this segment increased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues 
in addition  decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory led to an increase in gross margin percentage of for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
these increases in gross margin percentage were partially offset by a less favorable product mix which reduced gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
the less favorable product mix is attributable to increases in extended factory product sales which have lower gross margins as compared to other products within this segment 
gross margin of our global customer operations segment increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was attributable to higher revenues of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year  million of reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
gross margin percentage was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin percentage was attributable to higher absorption of indirect service overhead on higher revenues 
in addition  decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory led to an increase in gross margin percentage of for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and decreased amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets let to an increase in gross margin percentage of for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
gross margin for fiscal year was reduced by million for the impairment of certain long lived assets  including a million charge for completed technology intangible assets and million charge for property and equipment 
we did not incur any impairment charges for long lived assets in fiscal year the details of our impairment charges are discussed in greater detail under the impairment charges caption 
research and development research and development  or r d  expenses for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease is primarily related to lower labor related costs associated with headcount reductions initiated in fiscal years and our r d investments increased for each fiscal quarter throughout fiscal year  including million of r d expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as we increased our investments in certain new product programs 
we expect to increase the pace of spending for r d in the near term as we support enhancements to our current product offerings and our strategy to grow longer term revenues outside of the semiconductor market 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower litigation costs of million 
we settled our litigation matters with the sec during fiscal  however  we continued to incur substantial litigation costs  net of insurance reimbursements  throughout fiscal year as we indemnified costs incurred by a former executive 
we did not incur substantial litigation costs in fiscal year other cost decreases in sg a include million of reduced amortization of intangible assets primarily due to the 
table of contents impairment of those assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year these costs decreases were partially offset by million of increased depreciation expense for the implementation of the oracle erp system during the latter half of fiscal year  with the balance related primarily to higher labor costs 
during fiscal year  we capitalized approximately million of internal labor costs in connection with the oracle erp system implementation 
after the implementation was complete  the labor costs for the employees previously assigned to the oracle implementation was expensed as incurred 
this decrease in capitalized labor is the primary cause of the increased labor costs in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year impairment charges we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we conduct this test as of september th of each fiscal year 
our test of goodwill at september  and indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
we have not tested other intangible assets since the end of the second quarter of fiscal  since no events have occurred that would require an impairment assessment 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and an impairment charge for other long lived assets of million in the second quarter of fiscal year further  we recorded an additional impairment charge for other long lived assets of million in the third quarter of fiscal year the impairment of other long lived assets included million of charges reported as cost of sales  with the remaining million reported as operating expense 
the details of the goodwill and other long lived asset impairment charges are discussed further under the impairment charges caption in our comparison of fiscal year and results 
restructuring charges we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fiscal year these charges include severance related costs of million  and facility related costs of million 
the severance costs primarily include adjustments for contingent severance arrangements for corporate management positions eliminated in prior periods 
the facility costs include million to amortize the deferred discount on multi year facility restructuring liabilities 
in addition  we revised the present value discounting of multi year facility related restructuring liabilities during the first quarter of fiscal year when certain accounting errors were identified in our prior period financial statements that  individually and in aggregate  are not material to our financial statements taken as a whole for any related prior periods  and recorded a charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal year these facility charges are primarily related to a facility exited in fiscal year  for which the lease ends in july we recorded charges of million for fiscal year in connection with our fiscal year restructuring plan 
these charges consisted of million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions of approximately employees in operations  service and administrative functions across all the main geographies in which we operate  facility closure costs of million related primarily to the closure of one manufacturing operation located in the united states  and other restructuring costs of million 
the restructuring charges by segment for fiscal were critical solutions group million  systems solutions group million and global customer operations million 
in addition  we incurred million of restructuring charges for fiscal that were related to general corporate functions that support all of our segments 
interest income and expense interest income was million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease is mostly due to lower interest rates on our investments 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year gain on sale of intellectual property rights during fiscal year  we sold certain patents and patents pending related to a legacy product line 
we recorded a gain of million for this sale during the second quarter of the terms of the sale permit us to continue to use these patents to support our ongoing service and spare parts business included within our global customer operations segment 

table of contents loss on investment during fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million for the sale of our minority equity investment in a closely held swiss public company 
during fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million to write down this investment to its market value 
we no longer have an equity investment in this entity 
other income other income  net of million for fiscal year consists of joint venture management fee income of million which has been partially offset by foreign exchange losses of million 
other income  net of million for fiscal year consists of management fee income of million which has been fully offset by foreign exchange losses 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year this benefit includes a million refund from the carryback of alternative minimum tax losses as a result of the worker  home ownership and business assistance act of which provides for previously of certain net operating loss carrybacks against alternative minimum taxable income 
in addition  we can carryforward our remaining fiscal year alternative minimum tax net operating loss to future years to offset previously of alternative minimum taxes 
the tax benefit for fiscal year was partially offset by us state income taxes and foreign taxes 
we recorded a tax provision of million for fiscal year which was principally attributable to foreign income and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  and  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
we adopted the guidance related to uncertain tax positions on october  the implementation of this guidance did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
of the unrecognized tax benefits of million at september   we currently anticipate that no amounts will be settled in the next twelve months 
however  the statute of limitations is expected to lapse on various uncertain tax positions in the next twelve months  resulting in a decrease of million to our unrecognized tax benefits 
equity in earnings of joint ventures income associated with our interest in ulvac cryogenics  inc  a joint venture with ulvac corporation of japan  was million for fiscal year and the income loss associated with our interest in yaskawa brooks automation  inc  a joint venture with yaskawa electric corporation of japan was million for fiscal year as compared to million in the prior year

the total decrease in revenues of million impacted all of our operating segments 
our critical solutions group segment revenues decreased by million  our system solutions group segment revenues decreased by million and our global customer operations segment revenues decreased by million 
these decreases were the result of lower volume shipments in response to declining demand for capital equipment in all the markets we serve 
starting in the third quarter of fiscal  we began to experience an increase in demand for our products from our semiconductor capital equipment customers 
our critical solutions group segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to lower volume of shipments for all end markets served by this segment  including a decrease of million in revenues to the semiconductor end market  a decrease of million in revenues to the industrial end market and a million decrease in revenues to all other end markets served by this segment 

table of contents our system solutions group segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year

these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in litigation costs  net of insurance reimbursements  incurred by us to indemnify a former executive 
impairment charges we test our goodwill for impairment as of each fiscal year end 
our goodwill test as of september  indicated that our goodwill was potentially impaired  and after completing our analysis  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
in addition to the goodwill impairment charge  we recognized a long lived asset impairment charge of million 
the impairment charges were the result of our expectation that our future cash flows would be adversely impacted as a result of the global economic slowdown 
in response to this downturn  we restructured our business  which resulted in a change to our reporting units and operating segments 
we reallocated goodwill to each of our newly formed reporting units as of march   based on such factors as the relative fair values of each reporting unit 
we reallocated goodwill to five of our seven reporting units as of march  this reallocation  in conjunction with the continued downturn in the semiconductor markets indicated that a potential impairment may exist 
as such  we tested our goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment at march  we determined the fair value of each reporting unit as of march  using the income approach  specifically the dcf method 
the methodologies used to determine the fair value of the net assets of each reporting unit as of march  did not change from those used as of september   or those used as of september  the material assumptions used in the dcf method include discount rates and revenue forecasts 
discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital wacc  which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital 
the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies 
the average wacc used in the march  reallocation of goodwill was  as compared to for the goodwill test as of september  this increase was primarily the result of significantly increased costs of equity capital driven by increased volatility in equity markets 
management determines revenue forecasts based on its best estimate of near term revenue expectations which are corroborated by communications with customers  and longer term projection trends  which are validated by published independent industry analyst reports 
revenue forecasts materially impact the amount of cash flow generated during the five year discrete cash flow period  and also impact the terminal value as that value is derived from projected revenue 
the revenue forecasts used in the reallocation and assessment of goodwill as of march  were decreased from the levels forecasted for the goodwill impairment test as of september  due to further market deterioration 
for three of the five reporting units containing goodwill at march   we determined that the carrying amount of their net assets exceeded their respective fair values  indicating that a potential impairment existed for 
table of contents each of those three reporting units 
after completing the required steps of the goodwill impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million as of march  under gaap  we are required to test certain long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present 
we determined that impairment indicators were present for certain of our long lived assets as of march  we tested the long lived assets in question for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows attributable to each respective asset group to their carrying amounts  and determined that the carrying amounts were not recoverable 
we then evaluated the fair values of each long lived asset of the potentially impaired long lived asset group to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
the fair value of each intangible asset was based primarily on an income approach  which is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by the asset 
we estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of each intangible asset  which ranged from approximately to years  and used a discount rate of approximately 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that we had incurred an impairment loss of million as of march   and we allocated that loss among the long lived assets of the impaired asset group based on the carrying value of each asset  with no asset reduced below its respective fair value 
the impairment charge was allocated as follows million related to completed technology intangible assets  million to trade name intangible assets  million to customer relationship intangible assets and million to property  plant and equipment 
further  during the three months ended june  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million for property  plant and equipment related to the closure and outsourcing of a small manufacturing operation located in the united states 
the total impairment charges related to long lived assets for fiscal are summarized as follows in thousands year ended september  reported as cost of sales completed technology intangible asset impairment property  plant and equipment impairment subtotal  reported as cost of sales reported as operating expense trade name intangible asset impairment customer relationship intangible asset impairment subtotal  reported as operating expense restructuring charges we recorded charges of million for fiscal year in connection with our fiscal year restructuring plan

liquidity and capital resources our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and oems that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
this cyclicality makes estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows inherently uncertain 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from september  this decrease was primarily due to million of net purchases of marketable securities  capital expenditures of million and purchases of intangible assets of million 
these decreases were partially offset by million of cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the sale of intellectual property of million  proceeds from the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan of million and other cash items of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  and was comprised of net income of million  which includes million of net non cash related charges such as million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation and million of amortization of premiums paid on marketable security purchases which were partially offset by million from our gain on sale of intellectual 
table of contents property rights 
further  cash provided by operations was reduced by net increases in working capital of million  consisting primarily of million of increases in accounts receivable  million of increases in inventory and million of payments related to our restructuring programs implemented in prior years 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory were caused by a increase in revenues for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
these increases in working capital were partially offset by million of increases in accounts payable  million of increases in accrued warranty and retrofit costs and million of higher deferred revenues 
the increases in these liabilities are the result of increased business activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year and was attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of million  capital expenditures of million and intangible assets of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of intellectual property rights and million of proceeds from the sale of a minority interest in a closely held swiss public company 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million  and is comprised entirely of proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase plan 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from september  this decrease was primarily due to million of cash used in operating activities and capital expenditures of million 
these decreases were partially offset by million of net maturities of marketable securities 
cash used in operations was million for fiscal year  and was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  which included non cash impairment charges of million  depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million  and other non cash items of million 
cash used in operations was partially offset by million of changes in working capital which were attributable to our lower revenues  which led to a million reduction in accounts receivable and a million reduction in inventory 
these reductions in working capital were partially offset by lower current liabilities of million 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal year and was attributable to net maturities of marketable securities of million and million in proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  primarily related to the sale of a vacated manufacturing facility 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million of capital expenditures  including million in expenditures related to our oracle erp implementation 
we implemented the oracle erp system in most of our us operations in july we will incur additional costs to implement this system in our international locations  however  we do not expect this cost to significantly impact our financial position or cash flow 
at september   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
our contractual obligations consist of the following at september  in thousands less than one to four to total one year three years five years thereafter contractual obligations operating leases continuing operating leases exited facilities pension funding purchase commitments and other total contractual obligations amounts do not reflect approximately million of contractual sublease income 
we adopted the guidance related to uncertain tax positions on october  as of september   the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was 
table of contents million  of which million represents a future cash outlay 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the cash settlement for this liability since the timing of future tax examinations by various tax jurisdictions and the related resolution is uncertain 
in connection with our acquisition of helix technology corporation in october  we assumed the responsibility for the helix employees pension plan the plan 
we froze the benefit accruals and future participation in the plan as of october  we currently have a liability of million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at september  related to this plan 
the timing of payments we make for this plan is impacted by a number of estimates including earnings on plan assets and the timing of future distributions 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may materially impact the timing of future payments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made a voluntary contribution of million to this plan  which was in addition to the million of required minimum contributions made throughout fiscal year in addition  we are a guarantor on a lease in mexico that expires in january the remaining payments under this lease at september  are approximately million 
on june   we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec to sell up to million of securities  before any fees or expenses of the offering 
securities that may be sold include common stock  preferred stock  warrants or debt securities 
any such offering  if it does occur  may happen in one or more transactions 
specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the sec 
we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
the cyclical nature of our served markets and uncertainty with the current global economic environment makes it difficult for us to predict longer term liquidity requirements with certainty 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other key indicators of financial condition and operating performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda presented below are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest income  income tax provision benefit  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to give effect to certain non recurring and non cash items and other adjustments 
we believe that the inclusion of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in this form k is appropriate because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties 
we use adjusted ebitda internally as a critical measurement of operating effectiveness 
we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda facilitates operating performance comparison from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense 
in determining adjusted ebitda  we eliminate the impact of a number of items 
for the reasons indicated herein  you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider it appropriate 
in addition  in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of adjusted ebitda 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider them in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditure or contractual commitments  
table of contents they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
for these purposes  we rely on our gaap results

stock based compensation increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as more stock based awards were granted 
restructuring charges  including inventory related charges  were incurred in connection with restructuring plans initiated during fiscal years and restructuring costs incurred during fiscal year relate primarily to actions initiated under prior restructuring plans

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which allowed for the delay of the effective date for fair value measurements for one year for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
in april  the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance in determining whether a market is active or inactive  and whether a transaction is distressed  is applicable to all assets and liabilities ie  financial and non financial and requires enhanced disclosures 
this standard was effective beginning with our fourth quarter of fiscal the measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities were effective for us beginning on october  see note on october  we adopted the fair value measurement standard for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations  which significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration  pre acquisition contingencies  transaction costs  restructuring costs and income taxes 
on october  we adopted this standard prospectively and will apply the standard to any business combination with an acquisition date after october  in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding consolidation  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this standard clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
further  it clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this standard requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
on october  we adopted this standard retrospectively  which did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset

on october  we adopted this standard  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which classifies unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid as participating securities and requires them to be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
on october  we adopted this standard  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding compensation retirement benefits  which requires enhanced disclosures about the plan assets of a company s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the enhanced disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with a greater understanding of how investment allocation decisions are made  including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level on changes in plan assets for the period  and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
we adopted this standard for the fiscal year ended september  and enhanced our disclosures 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies  which requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie  and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure as our cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities  which are short term in nature  our exposure to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant 
our short term and long term investments consist mostly of highly rated corporate debt securities  and as such  market risk to these investments is not significant 
during the year ended september   the unrealized gain on marketable securities was  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual change of approximately million in interest income earned 
currency rate exposure we have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros and a variety of asian currencies 
sales in currencies other than the us dollar were of our total sales for the year ended september  these foreign sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries  which have cost structures that align with the currency of sale 
in the normal course of our business  we have short term advances between our legal entities that are subject to foreign currency exposure 
these short term advances were approximately million at september   and relate to the euro and a variety of asian currencies 
a majority of our foreign currency loss of million for fiscal year relates to the currency fluctuation on these advances between the time the transaction occurs and the ultimate settlement of the transaction 
a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates at september  would result in a million change in our net income loss 
we mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short term inter company advances by the timely settlement of each transaction  generally within days
