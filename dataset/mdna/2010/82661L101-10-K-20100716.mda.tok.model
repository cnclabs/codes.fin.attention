overview the company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of ems  which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled box build electronic products 
in connection with the production of assembled products  the company also provides services to its customers  including automatic and manual assembly and testing of products  material sourcing and procurement  design  manufacturing and test engineering support  warehousing and shipment services  and assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies 
the company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the united states  mexico  china and taiwan 
the company relies on numerous third party suppliers for components used in the company s production process 
certain of these components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  a customer s specifications may require the company to obtain components from a single source or a small number of suppliers 
the loss of any such suppliers or increases in component cost could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers 
in fiscal year  the company has experienced an increase in lead times for various types of components  due to increased demand 
the company does not enter into long term purchase agreements with the majority of its major or single sourced suppliers 
the company believes short term purchase orders with its suppliers provides flexibility needed to source inventory based on the needs of its customers 

table of contents sales can be a misleading indicator of the company s financial performance 
sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services consignment and turnkey rendered by the company and the demand by customers 
consignment orders require the company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer  and the company charges only for its labor  overhead and manufacturing costs  plus a profit 
in the case of turnkey orders  the company provides  in addition to manufacturing services  the components and other materials used in assembly 
turnkey contracts  in general  have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly  owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold 
variations in the number of turnkey orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the company s revenue levels 
however  the company does not believe that such variations are a meaningful indicator of the company s gross margins 
consignment orders accounted for less than of the company s revenues for the year ended april  in the past  the timing and rescheduling of orders have caused the company to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and earnings  and the company expects such fluctuations to continue 
the uncertainty associated with the worldwide economy in general and the united states economy specifically makes forecasting difficult 
short term customer demands remain volatile 
the company experienced an increase in demand in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year and it expects continued momentum heading into the first quarter of fiscal year critical accounting policies management estimates and uncertainties the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include depreciation and amortization periods  the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory and valuation of long lived assets 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of the company s electronic manufacturing services business are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer 
in general  it is the company s policy to recognize revenue and related costs when the order has been shipped from our facilities  which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order except for consignment inventory 
consignment inventory is shipped from the company to an independent warehouse for storage or shipped directly to the customer and stored in a segregated part of the customer s own facility 
upon the customer s request for inventory  the consignment inventory is shipped to the customer if the inventory was stored off site or transferred from the segregated part of the customer s facility for consumption  or use  by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue upon such transfer 
the company from time to time may ship an order from its facilities which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order and invoice the customer at the end of the calendar month 
this is done only in special circumstances to accommodate a specific customer 
the company does not earn a fee for storing the consignment inventory 
the company generally provides a day warranty for workmanship only and does not have any installation  acceptance or sales incentives  although the company has negotiated longer warranty terms in certain instances 
the company assembles and tests assemblies based on customers specifications 
historically  the amount of returns for workmanship issues has been de minimis under the company s standard or extended warranties 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the company establishes inventory reserves for valuation  shrinkage  and excess and obsolete inventory 
the company records provisions for inventory shrinkage based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect the company s inventories and cost of products sold 
the company records provisions for excess and obsolete inventories for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
actual product demand or market conditions could be different than that projected by management 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards codification asc or the codification fair value measurements and disclosures formerly sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in november  the fasb agreed to a one year deferral of the effective date of asc for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
there was no significant impact from adoption of asc for non financial assets and liabilities on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asc consolidation formerly sfas  noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 which establishes accounting reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest  and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
asc also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  there was no significant impact from adoption of asc on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  net sales decreased to  in fiscal year from  in the prior year 
the company s sales decreased in fiscal year in the consumer and industrial electronics  fitness  life sciences  and semiconductor marketplaces as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sales for these marketplaces was partially offset by an increase in sales in the appliance  telecommunications and gaming marketplaces 
the decrease in revenue for the fiscal year is a result of our customers decreased demand for product in the first and second quarters of fiscal year based on their forecast  which the company believes is attributable to the global economic slowdown 
the company experienced an increase in demand in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year the company s sales in a particular industry are driven by the fluctuating forecasts and end market demand of the customers within that industry 
sales to customers are subject to variations from period to period depending on customer order cancellations  the life cycle of customer products and product transition 
sales to the company s five largest customers accounted for and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross profit decreased to  or of net sales in fiscal year compared to  or of net sales in the prior year 
the decrease in the company s gross profit is due to decreased revenue levels  decreased plant capacity utilization and increasing commodity prices 
the increasing commodity prices and demand for raw components has resulted in upward pricing pressure from the company s supply chain 
there can be no assurance that sales levels and gross margins will not decrease in future quarters 
customer pricing pressures continue at all locations
