item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview hibbett sports  inc operates sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets  predominantly in the southeast  southwest  mid atlantic and lower midwest regions of the united states 
our stores offer a broad assortment of quality athletic equipment  footwear and apparel with a high level of customer service 
as of january   we operated a total of retail stores composed of hibbett sports stores  sports additions athletic shoe stores and sports co 
superstores in states 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  a  square foot store located primarily in strip centers which are usually influenced by a wal mart store 
approximately of our hibbett sports store base is located in strip centers  while approximately of our hibbett sports store base is located in enclosed malls 
over the last several years  we have concentrated and expect to continue our store base growth in strip centers versus enclosed malls 
we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of quality brand name merchandise and a high level of customer service 
we do not expect that the average size of our stores opening in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal the deteriorating global economic conditions experienced in fiscal improved slightly in fiscal and we were able to increase net income through effective management of expenses 
although footwear experienced an overall decline during the fiscal year  we saw improvement in all our other areas of merchandise which generally have a higher product margin 
we historically have increases in comparable store net sales in the low to mid single digit range 
we plan to increase total company wide square footage by over in fiscal  which is at the lower end of our historical range of to 
to somewhat offset the current slowing of new store openings  we have increased our rate of expanding and relocating high performing stores  increasing the square footage in existing stores in fiscal we expect to expand an additional stores in fiscal total sales percentage growth is expected to be in the low to mid single digits in fiscal over the past several years  we have increased our product margin through improved vendor discounts  fewer retail reductions and increased efficiencies in logistics 
we expect a slight improvement in product margin rate in fiscal as we continue to benefit from increased efficiencies from our previous investment in systems 
although the macroeconomic environment has presented many challenges in the last two years  our management believes that our business fundamentals remain strong and that we are well positioned for the future 
we are a leader in the markets in which we compete and we will continue to benefit from our comparatively low operating costs compared to the costs of our competitors 
we intend to manage our costs and inventories prudently as dictated by the current economic environment 
although at a slower pace than in prior years  we intend to continue to invest in initiatives to prepare our infrastructure for long term growth 
our management expects that the uncertainty of global economic conditions experienced over the last two years will continue 
any negative impact on customer discretionary spending could negatively impact our net sales and level of profitability in fiscal due to our increased net sales  we have historically leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
based on projected net sales  we expect operating  selling and administrative rates to decrease slightly in fiscal  primarily due to a return of comparable store sales growth 
we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base and to provide capital expenditures for both distribution center and technology upgrade projects 
we maintain a merchandise management system that allows us to identify and monitor trends 
however  this system does not produce us generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial information by product category 
therefore  it is impracticable to provide gaap net sales by product category 
hibbett operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january of each year 
the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years ended january   january  and february  includes weeks of operations 
we have operated as a public company and have been incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware since october  comparable store net sales data for the periods presented reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel or relocation results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months 
our four sports co  stores are not and have never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september and we do not have plans to open additional superstores in the future 
executive summary net sales for the fiscal year ended january   increased to million compared with million and million for the fiscal years ended january  and february   respectively 
operating income was of net sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal comparable store sales increased in fiscal  compared to a comparable store sales increase of in fiscal and a comparable store sales decrease of in fiscal net income in fiscal increased to million compared with million in fiscal earnings per diluted share increased to compared with for fiscal and for fiscal during the fiscal year  hibbett opened forty two new stores and closed twenty stores  bringing the store base to in states as of january  inventory on a per store basis at january  increased by compared to january   as we made a concerted effort to increase levels in advance of the spring sports season

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended january   from million for the weeks ended january  furthermore we opened hibbett sports stores while closing hibbett sports stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended january  nineteen high performing stores were expanded 
new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  compared to the weeks ended january  higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
items per sales transaction improved by compared to last year 
during fiscal  stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
the slight increase in comparable store net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of items per transaction and improved efficiencies in systems that enhanced our ability to offer the right product in the right store 
we also believe that the close proximity of our stores  coupled with brand name merchandise selection and successful college and professional sports seasons within our markets in the fourth quarter contributed to our increase in comparable store net sales 
with the exception of footwear  we experienced an overall increase in comparable store sales across our merchandise categories 
accessories made the largest comparable stores sales gains in the high teens and twenties while footwear  excluding cleats  declined mid single digits 
we believe the gains in accessory sales is the direct result of concentrated efforts of our operations and marketing teams to increase items per transaction by offering accessories as add ons at the point of sale 
we believe that the decline in footwear sales resulted from the lack of economic stimulus checks that were in the market one year ago and also from the tougher macroeconomic environment which has affected discretionary spending 
all other categories of merchandise performed within the levels we expected 
strip center locations continue to outperform enclosed mall stores 
strip center locations now comprise approximately of our total store base 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the week period of the prior fiscal year 
we attribute this increase in gross profit to increased markups  improved vendor contributions and reduced freight costs 
of the store occupancy related costs  rent expense had the greatest increase due to the increase in our store base and fewer construction allowance dollars to offset rent as landlords are delivering more complete stores 
utility expenses and real estate taxes also increased as a percent to net sales 
distribution expense decreases contributed the most to our increase in gross profit percent to net sales 
the most significant decreases were in data processing costs and fuel costs as we move towards delivery by third party logistics providers to our outlying stores  increasing the efficiency of the hibbett fleet 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january  expense trends we experienced included salary and benefit costs in our stores increased by basis points  resulting primarily from increased incentive sales pay and increases in the minimum wage 
administrative salary and benefit costs decreased slightly  although stock based compensation increased basis points as the result of the achievement of performance based awards and a higher stock price at the date of grant as compared to last year 
as a result of fewer store openings compared to last year  new store costs decreased basis points and store training costs associated primarily with the training of new store managers decreased basis points 
credit and debit card fees increased as a percent to net sales due to higher exchange rates 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended january  the average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal decreased to years compared to years  respectively 
we attribute the decrease in depreciation expense as a percent of net sales to the lower number of new stores added in the last two years and a lower investment in leasehold improvements for each new location as landlords are moving toward delivering more occupant ready stores and moving away from construction allowances and tenant completed units 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended january  the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended january   from million for the weeks ended february  we attributed this increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports stores while closing hibbett sports stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended january  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  compared to the weeks ended february  higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
although we saw a decrease in store traffic  items per sales transaction improved by 
during the weeks ended january   stores were included in the comparable store net sales comparison 
the slight increase in comparable store net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of items per transaction and improved efficiencies in systems that enhanced our ability to offer the right product in the right store 
we also believe that the close proximity of our stores  coupled with branded merchandise selection and the higher average fuel costs for most of the year  encouraged the customer in our smaller markets to shop closer to home 
we experienced the following trends in fiscal children s footwear performed well  while women s footwear weakened 
men s marquee product performed well 
the decline in the urban apparel business was offset by increases in mixed martial arts apparel and equipment 
our strip center stores outperformed our enclosed mall stores 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the week period of the prior fiscal year 
we attributed this increase in gross profit to improvement in shrinkage and markdowns 
store occupancy experienced its largest decrease in rent expense due to favorable lease terms resulting from co tenancy violations and from renegotiating certain leases  while utility expenses increased as a percent to net sales 
distribution expenses experienced decreases in data processing costs while fuel costs increased 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended february  expenses contributing to this increase included salary and benefit costs in our stores increased by basis points resulting primarily from increased incentive sales pay and increases in the minimum wage 
these expenses increased by basis points at the administrative level primarily as the result of increased bonus accruals 
legal fees decreased by basis points due to the settlement of employment litigation early in the year 
inventory counting expenses decreased by basis points as the result of taking fewer second store inventories compared to a year ago 
data processing costs decreased by basis points as we passed the anniversary of our implementation of our new merchandising system 
freight and shipping expenses increased overall by basis points  but have been decreasing with lower fuel costs in the last half of our fiscal year 
stock based compensation accounted for a decrease of basis points primarily due to lower stock prices in fiscal compared to fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended february  the average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal decreased to years compared to years  respectively 
we attributed the slight increase in depreciation expense as a percent to net sales primarily due to a change in estimate of the economic useful life of leasehold improvements in certain underperforming stores 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended february  the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings  stock repurchases and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended january  january  february  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  such as winter holidays and back to school 
inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces a positive cash flow 
in recent periods  we have experienced a trend of increasing free rent provisions in lieu of cash construction allowances in our leases 
we believe this is primarily the result of the tightening of commercial credit on our landlords 
because of this  the non cash portion of landlord allowances has also experienced increases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the weeks ended january  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in the weeks ended january  and february   respectively 
inventory levels have continued to increase year over year as the number of stores have increased  although the inventory per store has historically trended slightly down to flat 
ending inventory at january  was up compared to january  as the result of management s decision to bring in certain merchandise in advance of the spring sports seasons 
the increase in inventory used cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the accounts payable increase provided cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as we managed cash while protecting vendor discounts 
offsetting uses of cash was net income which provided cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
also contributing to the offset of uses of cash were non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in the fiscal periods ended january   january  and february  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
gross capital expenditures used million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we use cash in investing activities to build new stores and remodel or relocate existing stores 
furthermore  net cash used in investing activities includes purchases of information technology assets and expenditures for our distribution facility and corporate headquarters 
we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended february we estimate the cash outlay for capital expenditures in the fiscal year ended january  will be approximately million  which relates to the opening of approximately new stores  remodeling of selected existing stores  information system upgrades and various improvements at our headquarters and distribution center 
of the total budgeted dollars for capital expenditures for fiscal  we anticipate that approximately will be related to the opening of new stores and remodeling and or relocating existing stores 
approximately will be related to information systems with the remaining related primarily to office expansion  distribution center improvement and security equipment for our stores 
as of january   we had an approximate million outlay remaining on enhancements to our merchandising system relating to inventory planning 
we anticipate these upgrades will be implemented in the first quarter of fiscal and believe these enhancements will enable us to analyze and generally improve sales across all markets and merchandise by allowing us to better analyze inventory at the store level 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the weeks ended january  compared to net cash used of and million in the weeks ended january  and february   respectively 
the cash fluctuation as compared to prior fiscal years was primarily the result of the repurchase of our common stock 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during fiscal we expended million and million on repurchases of our common stock during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
financing activities also consisted of proceeds from transactions in our common stock and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of incentive stock options 
as stock options are exercised  we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction  however  the amounts and timing cannot be predicted 
at january   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities that allow borrowings up to million and million  respectively  and which renew in august and november  respectively 
the facilities do not require a commitment or agency fee nor are there any covenant restrictions 
we plan to renew these facilities as they expire and do not anticipate any problems in doing so  however  no assurance can be given that we will be granted a renewal or terms which are acceptable to us 
as of january   we did not have any debt outstanding under either of these facilities 
at january   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities that allow borrowings up to million and million  respectively  and which renewed in august and december  respectively 
at february   we had a revolving credit facility that allowed borrowings up to million and which renewed in august none of our credit facilities in any year presented required a commitment or agency fee nor were there any covenant restrictions
