item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of march   we own  license or franchise locations in states and foreign countries  of which are company owned and operate under the names california pizza kitchen  california pizza kitchen asap  and la food show and the remaining of which operate under franchise or license arrangements 
during our nearly years of operating history  we believe we have developed strong brand awareness and demonstrated the appeal of our concept in a wide variety of geographic areas 
our concept was  and still remains  to take our customers favorite food cravings and put them on a pizza to figuratively put the world on a pizza 
we opened our first casual dining restaurant in in beverly hills  california and grew steadily to restaurants by early our concept  with its signature line of innovative  premium pizzas  open flame ovens in exhibition style kitchens and excellent guest service  attracted pepsico  which bought a controlling interest in our company in may during the approximate five year period when pepsico was our controlling stockholder  we opened restaurants  of which were subsequently closed 
we experimented with different locations and different restaurant sizes  ranging from  square feet to more than  square feet 
our rapid expansion strained our infrastructure  resulted in a variety of management and operational changes  diverted our attention from the execution of our concept and led to disappointing operating results and financial performance  including a decline in comparable restaurant sales in at the end of  pepsico concluded that it would sell or otherwise divest all of its restaurant businesses  including california pizza kitchen 
in september  we consummated a series of transactions to effect a merger and leveraged recapitalization through which an investor group led by bruckmann  rosser  sherrill co  lp acquired pepsico s interest in our company 
in  we instituted an accelerated growth plan  focusing largely on further penetrating our existing markets 
between january and december  we opened company owned  full service restaurants and three cpk asap restaurants 
following rapid expansion  the board of directors asked richard rosenfield and larry flax  co founders and co chairmen of the board  to reassume the responsibilities of co ceos 
in connection with this management change  we reviewed our restaurant portfolio  as well as our operations and growth strategy  and decided to slow down our new restaurant opening schedule  emphasizing quality and profitability beginning in fiscal we introduced our new prototype full service restaurant in fiscal  which was larger than our former prototype 
the new prototype is approximately  square feet  has approximately indoor and outdoor seats and has been designed to create a more comfortable experience to enhance our dinner business 
costs on average are less than million for inline restaurants  our predominant structural environment 
this excludes pre opening costs  which average approximately  to  per restaurant 
during the months following the opening of a new restaurant  customer traffic generally settles into a more normalized pattern 
additionally  our new restaurants usually require a to day period after opening to reach their targeted restaurant level operating margin due to cost of sales and labor inefficiencies commonly associated with new restaurants 
as a result  a significant number of restaurant openings in any single fiscal quarter  accompanied with their associated pre opening costs  could have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations for that period 
therefore  our results of operations for any single fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 

table of contents our revenues are comprised of restaurant sales  license fees  domestic franchise royalties and international franchise royalties 
our restaurant sales are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  license fees are from our trademark license agreement with kraft  and domestic and international franchise royalties consist of monthly royalty income and initial franchise fees 
cost of sales is comprised of food  beverage and paper supplies  labor  and direct operating and occupancy expenses 
the components of food  beverage and paper supplies are variable and increase with sales volume 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  stock based compensation  bonuses and taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct operating and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
direct operating and occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant sales 
general and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and related employee benefits  stock based compensation  travel and relocation costs  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  currently consist of rent from the date construction begins through the restaurant opening date  the costs of hiring and training the initial work force  travel  the cost of food used in training  marketing costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant 
in calculating comparable company owned full service restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
as of january   we had company owned restaurants that met this criterion 

table of contents results of operations operating results for fiscal years  and are expressed as a percentage of revenues below  except for cost of sales  which is expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales statement of operations data revenues restaurant sales royalties from kraft licensing agreement domestic franchise revenues international franchise revenues total revenues costs and expenses food  beverage and paper supplies labor direct operating and occupancy cost of sales general and administrative pre opening costs operating income before depreciation and amortization  impairment  store closure and legal costs depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of property and equipment store closure costs legal settlement costs total costs and expenses operating income interest expense income income before income tax provision income tax provision net income labor percentage includes approximately basis points of stock based compensation in each of the fiscal years  and general and administrative percentage includes approximately  and basis points of stock based compensation in fiscal years  and  respectively 
this is a non gaap measure and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
we believe this measure provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our past and present financial results and provides an additional means for investors to evaluate business performance 
however  use of this measure should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by similarly excluded items 
weeks compared to weeks total revenues 
fiscal was a week year compared to weeks in the fourth quarter of included weeks and all other quarters in were weeks 
total revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in due to a million decrease in 
table of contents restaurant sales and a million decrease in domestic and international franchise revenues partially offset by a million increase in kraft royalties 
comparable restaurant sales declined  which was driven by a increase in pricing  increase in mix and a decrease in guest counts 
we believe the reduced restaurant traffic was primarily due to macroeconomic factors impacting the casual dining industry as a whole 
the slight decrease in domestic and international franchise revenues was the result of lower initial franchise fees in compared to  our partners opened five locations in compared to ten locations in royalties from our kraft licensing agreement increased to million in from million in due to higher sales of our frozen products 
food  beverage and paper supplies 
food  beverage and paper supplies decreased by million  or  to million in from million in food  beverage and paper supplies as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from in the prior year

labor 
labor increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  labor increased to in from in the prior year 
the increase in labor as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to lower comparable sales and associated deleveraging of fixed costs  minimum wage increases across our hourly labor base in states and increases in payroll taxes as tax rates reset to higher levels for calendar year which began in the last two weeks of fiscal stock based compensation included in labor totaled million in compared to million in direct operating and occupancy 
direct operating and occupancy increased by million  or  to million in from million in direct operating and occupancy as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in from in the prior year 
the increase in direct operating and occupancy expenses was principally the result of increased rent expenses due to the inclusion of the renewal option period in the lease term for certain locations offset by improved management of utility expenses and lower delivery charges 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs remained flat year over year at million in both and general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenue slightly increased to in from in the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to the deleveraging of general and administrative costs against lower sales 
stock based compensation included in general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in depreciation expense is primarily the result of lower depreciation due to the nine stores impaired at the end of offset by depreciation incurred for the five new stores opened in pre opening costs 
pre opening costs decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was chiefly attributable to the opening of five full service restaurants in compared to full service restaurants opened in pre opening costs include million and million in and  respectively  related to rent expense incurred during the restaurants construction periods 
loss on impairment of property and equipment 
we incurred a loss on impairment of property and equipment in of million compared to million in the increase of million in loss on impairment of property and equipment represented the impairment of full service restaurants in compared to three cpk asaps and seven full service restaurants in

labor costs in also included million of stock based compensation expense compared to million in direct operating and occupancy 
direct operating and occupancy increased by million  or  to million in from million in direct operating and occupancy as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in from in the prior year 
the dollar increase in direct operating and occupancy expenses was primarily due to increased rent  common area maintenance  utilities  advertising and higher credit card charges 
rent expense was increased in by  due to the inclusion of the renewal option period in the lease term for certain locations 
this change  accounted for as a change in accounting estimate  requires straight line rent and the amortization of deferred rent credits for certain stores  which were formerly calculated over years  to be calculated over years 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs increased by million  or  to million in from million in general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in the prior year 
the dollar increase in general and administrative 
table of contents expenses was primarily a result of additional personnel to support restaurant operations and increased professional services 
the company  along with the restaurant industry in california  has generally experienced a rise in purported plaintiff class action lawsuits in recent years related to wage and hour and other employment related issues 
legal defense costs rose significantly in as a result of the need to defend such suits  and the company will continue to defend itself against any and all claims 
general and administrative expenses in also included million of stock based compensation expense compared to million of stock based compensation expense in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in was primarily due to the addition of full service restaurants in the fiscal year 
this was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of  due to a change in accounting estimate which extended the useful lives of certain leaseholds from to years 
we added full service restaurants and one cpk asap in pre opening costs 
pre opening costs decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the full service restaurants that opened in compared to the full service restaurants and one cpk asap that opened in loss on impairment of property and equipment 
we incurred a loss on impairment of property and equipment in of million compared to none in the loss on impairment of property and equipment in represents the impairment charges for three cpk asaps and seven full service restaurants

we incurred store closure costs of million in compared to million in store closure costs in primarily related to the closure of one full service restaurant 
store closure costs in related to early termination costs that included lease buyouts and construction write offs for five cpk asaps 
legal settlement costs 
we had no legal settlement costs in compared to million in the million incurred in relates to anticipated costs associated with a meal break class action lawsuit filed against us in march interest expense income  net 
interest expense was million in compared to  in interest expense relates to borrowings against our line of credit  a portion of which is capitalized for new restaurants under construction 
income tax provision 
the effective income tax rate was for compared to for the company was impacted by a larger tax rate benefit from general business tax credits for due to lower earnings before taxes from the loss on impairment of property and equipment  partially offset by increases to the tax rate from the effects of stock based compensation  liability related to uncertain tax positions  and activity from the company s corporate owned life insurance purchased in conjunction with the deferred compensation plan 
net income 
net income decreased by million to million in from million in net income as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the million of loss on impairment of property and equipment and related tax impact in compared to none in in  we plan to open as many as eight full service restaurants  eight international full service franchised restaurants and five domestic franchised restaurants 
we expect earnings per share in the range of per diluted share based on comparable restaurant sales of between negative and 
we expect to utilize our free cash flow to repay our credit line borrowings 

table of contents potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors  changes in food costs  changes in labor costs  war and weather conditions 
in the past  we have experienced significant variability in pre opening costs from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily a function of the timing of restaurant openings 
we typically incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a given restaurant in the month of opening 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and direct operating and occupancy costs associated with a newly opened restaurant during the first three to four months of operation are often materially greater than what will be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales 
accordingly  the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and adverse weather 
our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality  which directly impacts tourism at our coastal california locations 
the summer months june through august have traditionally been higher sales volume periods than other periods of the year 
holidays  severe winter weather  hurricanes  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
many of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening expenses 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years  and in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
we fund our capital requirements principally through cash flow from operations and borrowings from our line of credit 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net income in each of the years presented primarily because of the effects of depreciation and amortization  loss on impairment of property and equipment and non cash compensation charges 
other than effects of changes in non cash items  net cash provided by operating activities was higher in than in primarily due to an increase in cash provided by deferred gift card revenue and a decreased use of cash for accounts payable  other operating liabilities  deferred tax assets and intangible assets 
these changes were offset by a decrease in cash provided by other receivables and deferred rent credits and an increased use of cash for prepaid expenses and other assets 
investing activities 
we use working capital and borrowings from our line of credit to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodel our existing restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities  which was related almost entirely to capital expenditures  was million in compared to million in and million in capital expenditures in resulted from million 
table of contents incurred on new restaurants and million incurred on capitalized maintenance  remodeling and other costs 
we opened full service restaurants in compared to full service restaurants in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in and net cash provided by financing activities of million in in  the company had net repayments on the credit facility of million compared to net borrowings on the credit facility in and of million and million  respectively 
net proceeds from issuance of common stock were million for  million for and million for and consisted of purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of million for and million for and and common stock option exercises of million  million and million  respectively 
while there were no stock repurchases in  we used million for and million for to buy back shares of our common stock 
on august   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program august program to acquire the company s common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
under the august program  up to million of the company s common stock may be repurchased from time to time over a month period 
the company repurchased no shares in under the august program 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares for million in the open market and  shares for million through a collared accelerated share repurchase agreement asr 
this aggregate of million completed the august program 
on july   the board of directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program july program to acquire the company s common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
under the july program  up to million of the company s common stock may be repurchased from time to time over a month period 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares in the open market for an aggregate price of million under the july program 
the company did not repurchase any shares in under the july program 
as of january  the company has million remaining on its repurchase authorization 
on may   the company replaced its million credit facility by entering into a new five year revolving credit facility the facility with a syndicate of banks  featuring a maximum available borrowing capacity of million 
the facility contains an uncommitted option to increase  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  the maximum borrowing capacity by up to an additional million 
the facility contains certain restrictive and financial covenants  including that the company maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio 
the facility is guaranteed by one of the company s subsidiaries and stipulates certain events of default 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at either libor or the prime rate  at the company s option  plus a spread ranging from to basis points for libor loans or zero to basis points for prime rate loans 
the company also pays a commitment fee on the unused facility ranging from to basis points per annum 
both the interest rate spread and the commitment fee level depend on the lease adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the terms of the facility 
the facility also includes a million sublimit for standby letters of credit 
as of january   the company had borrowings outstanding under the facility totaling million with an average annual interest rate of 
availability under the line of credit is also reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of january   which are used to support the company s self insurance programs 
available borrowings under the line of credit were million as of january  the facility matures in may as of january   the company is in compliance with all debt covenants 
the company expects to use any excess capital generated in to pay down debt 
future capital requirements 
our capital requirements  including costs related to opening additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations 
table of contents and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations and funds anticipated to be available from our credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short term and long term basis 
changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  failure to maintain financial covenants under our credit facility  financial and non financial covenant requirements or other events may cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as of january   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
as of january   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in the company s operating accounts 
the invested cash is held in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in high quality money market instruments  including primarily short term debt securities of us and foreign issuers 
to date  the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents  however  the company can provide no assurances that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time the company also has a range of approximately million to million in its operating accounts with third party financial institutions 
these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while the company monitors the cash balances in its operating accounts on a daily basis and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any vie transactions and do not otherwise have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of january  in millions total payments due by period less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations long term debt purchase obligations fin liability represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of the leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum rent based on a percentage of sales and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
long term debt represents the amount outstanding under the credit facility and does not include interest due to the uncertainty of future interest rates 
purchase obligations represents estimated construction commitments and excludes agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at january   the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
such judgment may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation  including stock option grants and restricted stock awards  based on fair value measurement guidance 
we use the black scholes valuation model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions  including the expected term vested options will be held before exercise  common stock price volatility over the expected term  and the number of options and restricted stock awards that will ultimately not vest forfeiture rate 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect fair value and our estimates of stock based compensation  ultimately affecting expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
long lived asset impairments we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  at least quarterly 
we assess recoverability of long lived assets at the restaurant level based on historical and estimated future cash flows along with other factors 
management has determined that restaurants open at least one year that demonstrate operating cash flows of less than a defined target over the period since opening should be evaluated for possible impairment 
based on the restaurant s future restaurant cash flow projections  future operating plans and other qualitative factors  we may recognize an impairment charge determined as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds fair value  which is based on discounted future cash flows 

table of contents estimates of future cash flows are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of local operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
leases all of our restaurant leases are currently classified as operating leases 
the lease term includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
we recognize rent over the lease term  which includes the rent holiday period  defined as the period from date of possession through store opening  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under terms of the lease 
rent expense from the date of possession through the restaurant opening date is included in pre opening expenses 
any delay in store opening can affect the rent holiday period  subsequently affecting the amount of pre opening expense and post opening  occupancy costs 
minimum base rent for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
many of our leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rent is accrued each period as the liability is incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
our total occupancy costs can vary due to fluctuations in contingent rents based on restaurant sales 
management applies judgment in determining whether a lease term should include option periods 
differences in estimated lease terms could materially affect amounts of rent expense  amortization of deferred rent credits related to tenant improvement allowances  and depreciation expense 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation 
property and equipment is depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term 
the cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed when incurred  while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized 
management applies judgment in determining the useful life of property and equipment and in classifying expenditures as capital or expense items 
depreciation expense and direct operating costs could be materially different if management came to different conclusions 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our employee workers compensation  general liability  automobile and health insurance obligations 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on historical claims data and our estimate of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
if actual claims  including the frequency or amount of claims  differ from our assumptions and estimates  changes in our liabilities would impact the expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
we test for recoverability of goodwill based on both a discounted cash flow analysis and 
table of contents multiple of earnings analysis comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value 
this analysis requires management to make assumptions about future revenues and expenses  rate of return  and market risk  among other factors 
changes in estimates of growth and market conditions may impact the fair value of the reporting unit and consequently the recorded value of goodwill 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time we prepare our income tax provision 
we typically file our income tax returns six to nine months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns may be audited by federal  state and local governments  often years after the returns are filed  making them subject to adjustment due to differing interpretations of tax law 
we review our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis  adding any new uncertain positions  or adjusting or removing existing positions that have been resolved 
management makes significant assumptions in evaluating its tax positions  including estimating the amount  timing and likelihood of ultimate resolution 
actual results can vary from these estimates  leading to material differences in our tax expense 
new accounting standards see the recent accounting pronouncements section of note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of new accounting standards 
inflation our profitability depends  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant guests 
while we have taken steps to enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant operations 
many of our restaurant employees are paid hourly rates equivalent to the higher of their states or the federal minimum wage 
in fiscal  congress enacted an increase in the federal minimum wage implemented in three phases  beginning in fiscal and concluding in fiscal in addition  numerous state and local governments increased the minimum wage within their jurisdictions  with further state minimum wage increases going into effect in fiscal certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending for food away from home could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that all of our future cost increases can be offset by higher menu prices  or that higher menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
many of the 
table of contents leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than three months as of the date of purchase 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in market prices related to our investments in marketable securities 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we could earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
as of january   we did not hold any marketable securities in our cash and cash equivalents or other current assets 
however  we are subjected to market risk related to our investments in mutual funds and corporate owned life insurance contracts coli used to support our deferred compensation executive retirement savings plan ersp to the extent these investments are not equivalent to the related liability 
the full impact of gains or losses in marketable securities related to the program is reflected in net income 
activity within the coli investments is generally not subject to income tax 
in may  the company entered into the facility with a syndicate of banks  which increased the maximum available borrowing capacity to million 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at either the london interbank offering rate libor or the prime rate  at the company s option  plus a spread ranging from to basis points for libor loans or zero to basis points for prime rate loans 
the company will also pay a commitment fee on the unused facility ranging from to basis points annually 
both the interest rate spread and commitment fee level depend on the company s lease adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
as of january   the company had borrowings outstanding under the facility totaling million with an average annual interest rate of 
availability under the line of credit is also reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of january   which are used to support the company s self insurance programs 
available borrowings under the line of credit were million as of january  the facility contains certain restrictive and financial covenants  including that the company maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio  with which the company was in compliance as of january  the facility matures in may based on the amount of our floating rate debt as of january   each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately  this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floating rate debt remains constant with an immediate across the board increase or decrease as of january  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period
