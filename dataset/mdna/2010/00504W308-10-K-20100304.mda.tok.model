executive level overview active power is a manufacturer and provider of efficient  reliable and green continuous power solutions incorporating ups systems that ensure business continuity for enterprises in the event of power disturbances 
our products and solutions are designed to deliver continuous clean power  protecting customers from voltage fluctuations such as surges and sags and frequency fluctuations and to provide ride through  or temporary  power to bridge the gap between a power outage and the restoration of utility power 
our target customers are global enterprises requiring power insurance because they have zero tolerance for downtime in their mission critical operations 
the ups products we manufacture use kinetic energy to provide short term power as a cleaner alternative to electro chemical battery based energy 
these products are highly reliable  energy and space efficient and significantly reduce client electricity expenses 
our flywheel based ups systems are marketed under the brand name cleansource 
our continuous power systems  which incorporate our ups products with switchgear and a generator to provide complete short and long term protection in the event of a power disturbance  are marketed under the brand name powerhouse 
as of december   we have shipped more than  flywheels in ups system installations  delivering more than megawatts of power to customers in countries around the world 
we also provide services including engineering  installation  start up  monitoring and repair for our products under contracts with our customers 
we are headquartered in austin  texas  with international offices in the uk  germany and japan 
our primary sales channel in north america has historically been through our oem partner  caterpillar  inc since  we have developed additional sales channels in north america including direct sales employees and a network of manufacturer s representatives  distributors and in an it partner channel 
these direct sales tend to improve our relationships with clients  generate higher selling prices compared to oem sales that improve our gross margins and add service and other revenue opportunities 
our primary sales channels in europe  middle east and africa emea and asia include selling directly to end users and indirectly through select value added resellers and distributors 
sales of active power branded products through our direct sales  manufacturers representatives  distributor and it partner channels were   and of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our total revenue in decreased from in a challenging world economic environment during  we witnessed two distinct trends in our business 
first  sales through our oem channels decreased from million in to million in  or by 
conversely  our non oem sales activities achieved growth of from million in to million in  due to improved performance and increasing acceptance for our containerized continuous power solution powerhouse in the marketplace 
we achieved strong growth in revenue in north america in  driven by the introduction of powerhouse  although we saw sales decreases in revenue in when compared to in europe  which is our second largest marketplace after the us  and also a decrease in in asia 
however  total revenue in europe did increase by in the second half of compared to the first half 

table of contents we believe revenues will continue to grow in from new product sales as we focus on selling more complete systems rather than just products 
in particular  we expect higher sales volume of our megawatt class ups products  and of additional variations of our flywheel based products  including containerized versions such as our powerhouse product 
we also expect a recovery in our oem sales in we believe that the investments we made during and in our sales organization to increase our level of direct sales staff  particularly in europe and north america  and on marketing activities to support all of our sales channels will contribute to improve sales results in despite lower revenues in  we were able to improve our gross profit in and for the fourth consecutive year report a positive gross margin 
our gross profit margin in was  which represents an improvement from the we achieved in and the we achieved in during  we recorded an impairment charge for coolair inventory of million  which represented approximately of our revenue 
the improvement in was due primarily to higher sales volumes made through our direct channels  higher product pricing and the absence of inventory impairment charges 
direct sales typically generate higher margins for us than sales that are made through our oem or distribution channels 
our gross margin in the fourth quarter of was 
this was down from the we recorded in the fourth quarter of on much higher flywheel volumes 
the fourth quarter gross margin was also impacted due to the higher portion of powerhouse revenues  on which we recognize lower overall margins compared to ups sales  as well as higher excess capacity costs 
we have recently scaled back our production levels to deliberately reduce our inventory levels and improve overall company liquidity 
as a result  we experienced higher excess capacity costs  which further dampened our gross margins since this resulted in a higher unabsorbed overhead in the factory 
our operating losses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we have been able to reduce our operating losses by million  or 
this reduction in losses is primarily due to the gross margin improvements that were driven by higher revenue levels  and by our efforts to control our operating expenses and manage our working capital 
our operating losses include coolair related inventory impairment charges of million and million in and and non cash stock based compensation expense included in the operating losses was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities decreased in to million  compared to million in this change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower operating losses 
in addition  changes in operating assets and liabilities  or our net working capital  resulted in cash provided of million in  compared to cash used in such working capital of million in as our business continues to grow  we have had to finance a larger level of inventory and receivables to support this higher level of activity 
our receivables increased by million during our inventory decreased by million during  although it decreased million during the fourth quarter  through lower production and purchases after having increased during the first three quarters of this  combined with an increase in trade payables of million during and an acceleration of customer payments  allowed us to finance our revenue growth from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter without significant depletion of our available cash and investments 
we also drew down million against our bank revolving line of credit facility during to help finance these working capital requirements 
we have a history of operating losses and have not yet reached operating profitability 
we believe that the success of our flywheel products and our powerhouse solutions  combined with our focus on direct sales to customers  will help us to increase our revenues and reduce our level of operating losses and the amount of cash that we consume in our operations 
our liquidity can be significantly impacted due to the concentration of receivables among a small number of customers and this trend may accelerate with an increase in our powerhouse business 
we will need to continue to focus on management of cash and working capital in in order to manage the level of funds we use in our operating activities 
our total cash and investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  subsequent to year end  
table of contents in february we sold approximately million shares of our common stock to a number of institutional investors at a purchase price of per share  for proceeds  net of fees and expenses  of approximately million in a firm commitment underwritten offering 
due to the improvements in our operations in the second half of  as well as our fundraising in february  we believe that our cash and investments are sufficient to meet our operational needs for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations  usually due to the customer s potential insolvency 
the allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified 
in addition  the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with certain customers 
the assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  risks unique to particular geographic regions  historical experience and existing economic conditions 
historically  a large portion of our sales have been made through oem channels to a few large customers  and so our credit losses have been minimal 
as we integrate additional distribution channels into our business and increase our direct sales to more and smaller customers  the risk of credit loss may increase 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we estimate inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products  the impact of new product introductions  inventory turns and specific identification of items  such as product discontinuance  damaged goods or engineering material changes 
warranty liability the estimated warranty liability costs are accrued for each of our products at the time of sale 
our estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product  including where little or no claims experience may exist 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates  changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results 
our estimate of warranty liability is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product and component failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs in correcting 
table of contents product failures  therefore our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
the resulting balances are then compared to current spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
revenue recognition in general  revenue for product sales is recognized when title has transferred to the customer as stipulated by the delivery terms in a sales contract 
in addition  prior to revenue recognition we require persuasive written evidence of the arrangement  a fixed or determinable price  and a determination that collectability is reasonably assured 
we also offer various services to customers depending on the type of product the customer has purchased  which may include on site services or installation and integration services 
such services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered product 
revenue for services is recognized at the time services are provided 
when products and services are contracted under a single arrangement  we allocate the total sales price to the multiple deliverables based on their relative fair values 
we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or services multiple elements 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value as determined by the sales price of each element when sold separately 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time 
a small change in estimates used can have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 

table of contents results of operations comparison of to product revenue product revenue primarily consists of sales of our cleansource power quality products  comprising both ups and dc product lines  and sales of continuous power systems cps which are comprised of our ups systems and some combination of third party ancillary equipment  such as engine generators and switchgear 
the cps products may be sold in a containerized solution that we call powerhouse  or as separate equipment 
product revenue also includes sales of our coolair dc product and coolair ups products 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
although product revenues decreased overall from  revenues attributable to powerhouse  a new revenue source in  were million 
we also saw a million increase in sales of our kva product line 
these increases were offset by a decrease in sales of our other product lines  including our kva product line and our megawatt class product line  which decreased by million and million  respectively  from the decrease in product revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in product sales from our oem channels  where ups sales decreased by  or million  compared to  which was offset by the increase in powerhouse revenues 
powerhouse contracts tend to be larger in value and this may contribute to more volatility in revenues on a quarterly basis 
they also significantly affect our cash flows as we have fewer customers with significantly larger receivables 
while this concentration does increase liquidity risk for us  we continue to improve and refine the payment terms of these sales opportunities as part of our working capital management 
as our solutions business grows  the composition of our sales will likely change and fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
we have experienced an increase in third party systems and components that are being packaged and resold to our clients  which we believe will continue to help increase our revenue 
even though margins on sales of third party equipment are less than what we generate on our own manufactured goods  it does become an important catalyst for professional services and maintenance revenues  which can generate higher margins 
in  we sold flywheel product units  a decrease over the units that we sold in due primarily to the decrease in oem product volume 
however  the average sales price per flywheel increased slightly to approximately  in from approximately  in  due largely to the higher proportion of wheels sold through our direct sales channels 
our direct sales channel typically has higher sales prices and profit margins compared to our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
we expect this trend in mix and average selling price to continue 
the decrease in wheels sold was greater than the overall decline in revenue in  with the difference attributable to sales of our cps 
the frequency and timing of our larger system sales  including megawatt class ups products and our cps  is more volatile and can result in material changes in period to period revenue 
such revenues also can occur in periods other than when originally anticipated  which can add to the potential volatility and affect our ability to meet forecasted targets 
larger system sales may also involve higher amounts of ancillary products upon which we typically generate lower profits when compared to sale of our ups products only 
therefore  a significant increase in product revenues that was caused by higher sales of ancillary products may not result in a commensurate increase in our gross or operating profit levels 

table of contents north america sales were of our total revenue for  compared to for this was due in part to the success with some of our it channel partners  including sun and hewlett packard  of our powerhouse product that we introduced into the north american market during we continued to expand the sales territories where we sell our active power branded products in as we increased our sales distribution capabilities  particularly in europe and asia 
we also increased the size of our sales and service organization in the uk and germany 
although we saw sales decreases in europe and asia  we are encouraged as our second half performance in europe increased by over the first half of the year 
we anticipate higher revenues from both europe and asia in sales to caterpillar represented of our product revenue in  as compared to of our product revenue in caterpillar remains our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
however  our revenue from caterpillar decreased by in and in the fourth quarter of caterpillar was of our quarterly revenue 
some of this decrease is attributable to the timing of larger orders from caterpillar for its customers 
we believe that this channel has been negatively influenced by external economic conditions that have caused its customers to delay product purchase decisions due to uncertainty or lack of liquidity 
sales of our ups products are also a much smaller part of caterpillar s total business and subject to more volatility in quarterly sales  particularly during difficult economic periods as caterpillar focuses on its core business 
we believe this business will recover and remain strategically important to active power  and are starting to see signs of improvement in this channel already in our products perform well in harsh environments where power quality or reliability is particularly poor  which makes them a good fit for countries with a poor power infrastructure or in harsh manufacturing or process environments  or situations where reliability is paramount  such as mission critical business applications 
therefore we have traditionally focused our direct sales efforts to these types of customer situations 
service and other revenue service and other revenue primarily relates to revenue generated from both traditional after market service work and from customer specific system engineering 
this includes revenue from design  installation  startup  repairs or reconfigurations of our products and the sale of spare or replacement parts to our oem and end user customers 
it also includes revenue associated with the costs of travel of our service personnel and revenues or fees received upon contract deferment or cancellation 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change service and other revenue increased in although our larger installed base of customers that purchased products directly from us has resulted in a higher level of customers with recurring maintenance contract agreements  our revenues from project installation and commissioning has decreased as compared to due to a smaller number of large projects in however  in the fourth quarter of  service and other revenue increased from the prior quarter  which was primarily attributable to the higher level of project related services in connection with increased sales and installation of our powerhouse product and related services 
the increase in our installed base of customers  particularly those arising from direct sales made by us  is driving the trend of higher service and spares revenue 
our service and other revenue in was also helped by our improved level of direct sales and large multi megawatt sales that affords us the ability to generate higher startup service revenues 
in we recorded million of fees related to contract cancellation by one 
table of contents customer but we had no cancellations during we anticipate that service and other revenue will continue to grow as our product revenue increases and as our installed base of product expands because as more units are sold to customers  more installation  startup and maintenance services will be required 
in addition  because our oem partners typically provide these services to their end user customers  an increase in direct sales as a percentage of our total revenue would likely lead to a further increase in our service and other revenue 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of component parts of our products  ancillary equipment that is sourced from external suppliers  personnel  equipment  and other costs associated with our assembly and test operations  including costs from having underutilized facilities  depreciation of our manufacturing property and equipment  shipping costs  warranty costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our cost of product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the decrease in cost of product revenue was driven by the decrease in product revenues that we experienced in  as well as the absence of inventory impairment charges and lower product cost levels in  reflecting the results of product cost reduction programs we have implemented 
the cost of product revenue included a million charge for excess inventory and impairment of manufacturing assets related to our coolair product family  which  net of current product sales backlog and future spares and support requirements  was reduced to its salvageable value 
cost of product revenue included approximately million and million of stock based compensation for and  respectively 
we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sell as well as by lowering our product cost 
this has been partially offset by the impact of increased sales of our cps  such as powerhouse 
our margins on powerhouse sales are lower compared to our ups sales because we realize lower margins on the third party equipment that we purchase and include in our powerhouse product 
we also scaled back our production levels in the fourth quarter to deliberately reduce our inventory levels and to improve overall company liquidity 
as a result  we experienced higher excess capacity costs  which decreased our gross margins because of the higher unabsorbed overhead in the factory 
however  we continue to implement our strategy to improve the profitability of individual transactions and the profitability of the company as a whole 
we believe that as our direct sales and our total revenues continue to increase  our product margins will continue to improve 
we have also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility  which has a large portion of fixed costs 
we incur approximately million per year in fixed costs for our manufacturing facility that has a capacity in excess of our current business requirements 
we expense the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues 
we now produce more goods with less overhead than in previous years 
some of this efficiency is driven by higher product volumes that allow for better utilization of our test facility and our manufacturing space 
we also have ongoing programs within our engineering and manufacturing departments to lower product costs  to identify alternative and cheaper vendors if possible  without impacting quality levels  to reduce our absolute level of overhead spending and headcount  and to improve the manufacturability of our products 
during these efforts have helped reduce our cost of product revenue in spite of the pressures of higher raw material and commodity price increases 
for we anticipate further cost reductions from these ongoing programs 

table of contents cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue includes the cost of component parts that we use in service or sell as spare parts to customers  as well as the labor and overhead costs of our service organization  including travel and related costs incurred in fulfilling our service obligations to our customers 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our cost of service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin cost of service and other revenue decreased in while service and other revenue increased 
this decrease reflects better utilization of our service personnel in  improved pricing for services and higher margin contract work  as well as higher service volume 
in we saw a increase due to higher headcount and related expenses that we put in place during the year to expand our service capabilities around the world that supported the increase in service revenues we recorded in cost of service and other revenue included approximately  and  of stock based compensation for and  respectively 
balancing our labor requirements to our customer needs will continue to be a business challenge for our service organization in  as we seek to ensure that we do not incur additional fixed labor costs in advance of anticipated service revenues 
achieving the efficient utilization of our service labor will be key to profitably growing this area of our business 
many of the costs of the service organization are fixed in nature  and higher volume of installation  startup and service work is resulting in improved efficiency and operating results for this group 
we expect this trend to continue in research and development research and development expense primarily consists of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  third party consulting and development activities  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our research and development expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology under development  as well as enhancements to our megawatt class ups products and refinement and standardization of our containerized product solutions 
the decrease in spending compared to is primarily a result of lower headcount and lower prototype expenses 
the prior year expenses included higher prototype and development costs for paralleling our megawatt class ups products 
research and development expense included approximately million and million of stock based compensation in and  respectively 
we believe that research and development expenses will remain at current levels in  although this will represent a smaller percentage of our total revenue  and that the spending will be focused on enhancements and cost reductions to our flywheel products 

table of contents selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses primarily comprise compensation and related costs for selling and marketing personnel  and related travel  fees paid to external sales partners  other selling and marketing expenses  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling and marketing expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the decrease in selling and marketing expenses in largely reflects spending controls and lower variable selling expenses on lower sales levels 
although the total headcount has not changed significantly since  we have changed the composition of our sales organization from supporting oem partners to supporting more direct selling 
we have also increased our marketing department staffing as we concentrate on developing and improving the active power brand  and supporting our direct selling activities 
selling and marketing expense included approximately million and million of stock based compensation for and  respectively 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in but reduce as a percentage of revenues as we expand our direct sales force into new geographies  add specific resources to support the it channel and due to higher variable compensation as our revenues continue to increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees  taxes  and the allowance for doubtful accounts expense 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the decrease in general and administrative expense from to reflects lower expenses for executive incentive compensation and lower bad debt allowances in these lower expenses were offset by higher professional fees incurred in connection with the private placement of securities that we made in the second quarter of and with the employee stock option exchange program that we completed in the third quarter of general and administrative expense included approximately million and million of stock based compensation for and  respectively 
we anticipate that the level of general and administrative expenses in should remain at similar absolute levels to those in interest income the following table summarizes the yearly changes in our interest expense income in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change 
table of contents the decrease in interest income from to a net expense in is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of available funds that we had for investment during as our operating losses decreased our cash reserves  the decline in interest rates during that lowered our investment returns  and interest expense paid on balances outstanding under our revolving credit arrangement 
we expect interest income to fluctuate depending on cash and investment balances and trends in interest rates 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
during we recorded a net tax benefit due to certain tax credits that we earned 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carryforward was million and our research and development credit carryforwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carryforward amounts may offset future taxable income that we may achieve and future tax liabilities 
however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carryforwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
comparison of to product revenue product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in product revenue from was due to million in increased sales of our kva product line  million in increased sales of our megawatt class product line  as well as million in increased sales of ancillary equipment that we sold to customers along with our ups products 
these increases were offset by a decrease in sales of our dc product line  kva product line and coolair product line  of million  million and million  respectively  from the decrease in sales of those product lines was the result of decreased emphasis and channel development of the dc product line compared to our ups products and a decreased emphasis on sales in the other product lines as we have concentrated on our ups sales 
in  we sold flywheel product units  a increase over the units that we sold in the average sales price per flywheel increased by to approximately  in from approximately  in the increase in average selling price was due to price increases  the product mix and proportionately more wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
our direct sales channel typically has higher sales prices and profit margins compared to our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
north america sales were of our total revenue for  compared to for we continued to expand the sales territories where we sell our active power branded products in  as we increased our sales distribution capabilities  particularly in europe and asia 
we also increased the size of our sales and service organization in the uk and europe 
sales to caterpillar represented of our revenue in as compared to of our revenue in and caterpillar remains our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
our revenue from caterpillar increased by in this increase was driven by a number of large sales of our megawatt class ups products through this channel 
service and other revenue the increase in our installed base of customers  particularly those arising from direct sales made by us  is driving the trend of higher service and spares revenue 
our service and other revenue in was also helped by our improved level of direct sales and large multi megawatt sales that affords us the ability to generate higher startup service revenues 
we also recorded million of fees related to contract cancellation in by one customer 
cost of product revenue the increase in cost of product revenue was driven by the increase in product revenues that we experienced in the cost of product revenue did not increase at the same rate as product revenue  as we had 
table of contents lower product costs reflecting the results of product cost reduction programs we have implemented 
the cost of product revenue also included a million charge for excess inventory and impairment of manufacturing assets related to our coolair product family that was based on the then current assessment of product demand for coolair 
in september  we recorded an additional reserve of million against the coolair inventory as a result of our further diminished expectations of future product demand that potentially would result in excess quantities of coolair inventory 
net of current product sales backlog and future spares and support requirements  the coolair inventory value was reduced to its salvageable value 
we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sell as well as by lowering our product cost 
as a result  our product revenue increased more than the increase in the cost of product revenue 
this has been part of our strategy to improve the profitability of individual transactions and the profitability of the company as a whole 
in  we increased sales of higher margin product options and features with the ups systems we sold  which lead to a further increase in our average selling price 
cost of service and other revenue the increase of in the cost of service and other revenue in was driven by the increase in service and other revenue 
the increase also reflected the higher headcount and related expenses that we put in place during the year to expand our service capabilities around the world 
as our direct sales organization has expanded we added service and technical personnel  including in many foreign markets  in order to support our selling efforts and to meet our customer responsibilities 
research and development our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology under development  as well as enhancements to our megawatt class ups products and refinement of our containerized product solutions 
the decrease in spending compared to is primarily a result of lower headcount 
the expense included approximately million of stock based compensation 
selling and marketing the increase in selling and marketing expenses in largely reflected higher variable compensation that was paid to our sales employees on higher revenue levels 
although the total headcount had not changed significantly since  we changed the composition of our sales organization from supporting oem partners to supporting more direct selling 
we also increased our marketing department staffing as we concentrated on developing and improving the active power brand  and supporting our direct selling activities 
the expense also includes approximately million of stock based compensation 
general and administrative the decrease in general and administrative expense from to was primarily attributable to the absence of million in expenses incurred in related to an investigation into our historical stock option granting procedures that resulted in restatement of prior year financials 
interest income the decrease in interest income from to is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of available funds that we had for investment as our operating losses decreased our cash reserves and to the decline in interest rates during during the year  as part of our investment strategy  we moved more investments into short term instruments in reaction to the declining interest rate environment 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we did not record any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity at december  are our cash and investments on hand  our bank credit facilities and projected cash flows from operating activities 
if we meet our cash flow projections in our current business plan  we expect that we have adequate capital resources in order to continue operating our business during our business plan and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding expected revenues and future costs 
however  there are scenarios in which our revenues may not meet our projections  our costs may exceed our estimates or our working capital needs may be greater than anticipated 
further  our estimates may change and future events or developments may also affect our estimates 
any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage in or significantly affect our level of liquidity  which may require us to seek additional financing or take other measures to reduce our operating costs in order to continue operating 
our cash and investments at december  totaled million 
in may  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor  pursuant to which we sold in a private placement  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a purchase price of per share the opening trading price of our common stock on the date of the transaction  or million in the aggregate 
we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in august to register the underlying shares offered in the private placement  which was declared effective on november  in november  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  using a shelf registration process 
under this shelf process  we may  from time to time  sell any combination of the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of  this filing became effective december  in february  we sold approximately million shares at a purchase price of per share  for proceeds  net of fees and expenses  of approximately million in a firm commitment underwritten offering under this shelf registration 
these proceeds are designed to strengthen our balance sheet and will be used to help fund our working capital requirements during and for general corporate purposes 
in october  we entered into a modified loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb 
the loan agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit in an amount of up to million subject to a borrowing base formula 
three million dollars of this credit facility is secured under a us government guaranteed export import credit facility that would add a us government guarantee to the payments for these foreign shipments and make more of our foreign shipments eligible as security for the credit facility 
this guarantee applies to export import sales of the parent company and does not apply to sales made by our foreign subsidiaries 
the remaining million credit facility does not have this guarantee and is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
prior to this modification to add the export import facility  export revenues were not eligible to be included as part of the borrowing base  which limited our ability to utilize the revolving credit facility 
all amounts borrowed under this credit facility are subject to a borrowing base formula based on eligible receivables and inventory 
during the years ended december  and we borrowed million and million  respectively  under this credit facility and these borrowings remained outstanding at december  based on the borrowing base formula  we had an additional million available for use at december  under this credit facility 
the loan agreement requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of unrestricted cash to the outstanding amounts under the loan agreement of at least to in addition  the loan agreement contains customary affirmative covenants  including covenants that require  among other things  the delivery of financial statements  compliance with laws  the maintenance of insurance and the protection and registration of intellectual property rights 
further  the loan agreement contains customary negative covenants  including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  dispose of assets  change our business  change our ceo or cfo  make acquisitions  be acquired  incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  make distributions  repurchase stock  and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  in each case subject to customary 
table of contents exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type 
we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december  revolving loans under this credit facility may be borrowed  repaid and re borrowed until october   at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid and all outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized 
revolving loans bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of svb s prime rate plus or 
a default interest rate shall apply during an event of default at a rate per annum equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
the revolving loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  provided that such security interest is limited to no more than of the outstanding capital stock held by us of each of our subsidiaries 
an increase in sales of our powerhouse may materially impact the amount of liquidity required to fund our operations 
the amount of time between the receipt of payment from our customers and our expenditures for raw materials  manufacture and shipment of products the cash cycle for sales of our cleansource ups product can be as short as days  and is typically days 
however  the cash cycle on a powerhouse sale can be as much as days  depending upon customer payment terms 
we intend to mitigate the financial impact of this longer cash cycle by requiring customer deposits and periodic payments where possible from our customers 
this is not always commercially feasible  and in order to increase our powerhouse sales  we may be required to make larger investments in inventory and receivables 
these larger investments may require us to obtain additional sources of working capital  debt or equity financing in order to fund this business 
we are currently evaluating a number of non equity financing sources  including extended trade credit facilities from some of our suppliers and business partners  to help us potentially finance growth in our powerhouse business 
we are also looking at possible changes to our current banking facility to enable us to borrow more against the current facility  and in particular against work in progress against powerhouse orders  in addition  we are currently examining other potential sources of debt financing 
these options are all designed to provide us with additional sources of capital if we require them to fulfill a growing number of powerhouse sales 
as discussed  should additional funding be required  we would expect to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
significant uses of cash operating activities the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash used in operating activities in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change cash used in operating activities in was million  compared to million in  a decrease of  or million 
this change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower operating losses 
in addition  changes in operating assets and liabilities  or our net working capital  resulted in cash provided of million in  compared to cash used in such working capital of million in 
table of contents as our business continues to grow  we have had to finance a larger level of inventory and receivables to support this higher level of activity 
our receivables increased by million during our inventory decreased by million during  primarily during the fourth quarter  through lower production and purchases 
this  combined with an increase in trade payables of million during and an acceleration of customer payments  allowed us to finance our revenue growth from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter without significant depletion of our available cash and investments 
on an annual basis  the increase in trade payables offset the increase in receivables  and our inventory levels did not increase as they had in  which combined with lower operating losses resulted in the decrease in funds used in operations 
as a small company  we can be significantly impacted due to the concentration of receivables amongst a small number of customers 
this risk may potentially increase as we sell more powerhouse products due to their higher average selling price 
we do continue to request deposits and periodic payments from large customers where commercially possible  particularly for projects with multiple deliverables 
however  the amount of such advance payments can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  depending on the size and scope of customer orders at any point in time 
as a result  we will need to continue to focus on management of cash and working capital in in order to manage the level of funds we use in our operating activities 
we used million of cash in funding our operating activities in  which was million or higher than in this increase was primarily due to changes in working capital that required us to increase the amount of inventory and receivables that we had  as our revenues increased 
this increase in working capital mitigated the impact of lower operating losses 
our receivables at the end of were higher than the end of  reflecting the increase in fourth quarter revenues to million 
we did not experience any material changes in the payment cycles for our payables or collections during the increase in revenue in the second half of resulted in a significant improvement in the amount of cash used in operations 
net cash used in operations decreased from million in the first half of to million in the second half of reflecting this higher sales volume 
investing activities investing activities primarily consist of sales and purchases of investments and purchases of property and equipment 
fluctuations in the sale and purchase of investments generally reflect our use of these investment funds to finance our ongoing operations 
the cash provided from investing activities decreased from million in to cash used in investing activities of  in as we depleted our available investments to fund our ongoing operations and our capital expenditures in capital expenditures during decreased slightly from by approximately million and primarily related to equipment to support our sales and marketing activities 
we historically invested in our manufacturing infrastructure and with a production capacity far in excess of our current revenue level we can substantially increase our production levels without needing to make any material capital investments 
our capital expenditures therefore will primarily support expansion of our sales and service capabilities and our marketing and administrative efforts as required 
financing activities funds provided by financing activities during primarily reflect the sale of common stock through a private placement to an institutional investor  which generated million in proceeds  and from an increase of million in borrowings against our bank lending facility 
funds provided by financing activities during were million  which reflects the amount that we borrowed from our bank in under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents contractual commitments in our day to day operations  we incur commitments to make future payments for goods and services 
these arise from entering into operating leases and as we make commitments to vendors to provide us materials and services 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations our principal lease commitments consist of our leases for our corporate headquarters and engineering and administration facilities and our global sales offices 
in  we entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility of up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  with svb 
this facility was modified in to increase the limit to million 
there was million and million outstanding under this facility at december  and  respectively 
future uses of cash we believe that our cash and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
our sales cycle is such that we generally have visibility quarters in advance for future orders that allows us to predict revenues over this period of time with some degree of confidence 
however a sudden change in business volume  positive or negative  from any of our business or channel partners or in our direct business could significantly impact our expected revenues 
the recent global economic slump has reduced our confidence at predicting future revenues  and even with improving economic conditions  there is still uncertainty and risk in our forecasting 
this quarter window of sales visibility does provide us with some opportunity to adjust expenditures or take other measures to reduce our cash consumption if we can see and anticipate a shortfall in revenue or give us time to identify additional sources of funding if we anticipate an increase in our working capital requirements due to increased revenues or changes in our revenue mix 
if there is a significant increase in our powerhouse business  this could potentially impact the amount of working capital that we may require  due to the longer production time and cash cycle of sales of this product 
we expect the level of capital investments to remain similar in to those in we currently intend to invest in several powerhouse systems to use for demonstration purposes in the us and in the us to help our sales efforts  but are not planning any other major capital investments during we still have outstanding liabilities for tax obligations from the stock option investigation that we expensed in but that we expect will be paid in other factors that may affect liquidity beyond the next twelve months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the market acceptance of our products  the gross profit we are able to generate with our sales  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
although we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition or merger  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future to help accelerate our growth  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
should additional funding be required  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders 
table of contents could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb updated fasb asc  generally accepted accounting principles fasb asc 
the update establishes the fasb standards accounting codification codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
this update is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the update on july   as required and concluded it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb updated fasb asc  revenue recognition fasb asc that amended the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments will change the application of the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national government entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of investments that we allow and in terms of the credit quality of the investments we hold 
we estimate that a decrease in market interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by approximately million 
because of the nature of the majority of our investments  we do not believe a decline in interest rates would have a material effect on their fair value 
our international sales have historically been made in us dollars 
as we have increased sales in foreign markets and opened operations in multiple foreign countries  we have executed more transactions that are 
table of contents denominated in other currencies  primarily euro and british pounds 
those sales and expenses in currencies other than us dollars can result in translation gains and losses which have not been significant to date 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations other than an increasing amount of sales and support expenses being incurred in foreign currencies as a natural hedge 
however  recent volatility in currencies  particularly with the pound and euro  is increasing the amount of potential translation gains and losses and we may engage in hedging activities in the future to mitigate the risks caused by such currency volatility 
our international business is subject to the typical risks of any international business  including  but not limited to  the risks described in item a  risk factors 
accordingly  our future results could be materially harmed by the actual occurrence of any of these or other risks
